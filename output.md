## Business User Guide

#### Customer to Meter Overview

Oracle Utilities Customer to Meter is a next generation customer service and billing application that incorporates a modern
meter data management system. This system is designed to scale with mass smart meter volumes while handling the
complexity associated with a utility’s processes across multiple types of service, operating divisions, and jurisdictions. The
new application components allow for traditional scalar meter functionality that is equivalent to prior versions of Oracle
Utilities Customer Care and Billing; so, it can accommodate the many types of utility environments, and evolve with the
business to include more advanced digital requirements.

The roles for each application area in Oracle Utilities Customer to Meter are defined as follows:

The application components have internal integration for master, admin, and transactional data. The primary transactions
between them are for bill determinant processing with MDM and service order processing with SOM. These transactional
processes can be initiated by the CCB solution, or from other external systems.


-----

In addition, Oracle Utilities Customer To Meter can also include asset management functionality via Oracle Utilities
Operational Device Management which provides the ability to handle large volumes of assets and to manage the receipt,
installation, maintenance, tracking and removal of those assets.

##### Oracle Utilities Customer Care and Billing Overview

Oracle Utilities Customer Care and Billing (CCB) manages customer information and processes associated with the
customer lifecycle including:

- Sales and marketing, and program management.

- Customer information for residential, commercial, and industrial customers; including, complex premise management,
umbrella agreements, and quotations proposals.

- Starting and stopping service; including, order entry for eligible products and services.

- Customer care interactions for inbound communications (such as phone calls), outbound communications (such as letters
or notifications), and case management (configurable customer processes).

- Advanced rating rules.

- Financial management for billing, budget plans, deposits, loans, and payment processing (including cashiering portals).

- Credit and collection for overdue receivables management.

Oracle Utilities Customer Care and Billing acts as a detailed sub ledger for accounts receivables with the ability to
send results to a general ledger. It also provides a Control Central portal that increases productivity by providing a
comprehensive view of the customer and their related account information so that most questions can be quickly answered
without having to navigate through the system.

##### Oracle Utilities Meter Data Management Overview

Oracle Utilities Meter Data Management (MDM) acts as a consolidated usage measurement data repository with advanced
validation, editing, and estimation (VEE) rules. These rules ensure accuracy and measurement compliance that is associated
with advanced metering infrastructure (AMI), traditional one-way meters, and a rich usage calculation rules engine.

The following lists the most crucial business processes that are enabled within this system:

- Defining devices; such as, meters at customer locations, device configurations for measurement collection and command
execution, customer service points, and effective device installations.

- Loading scalar readings, interval data, and events data from a Head End system or other source.

- Automatic validating, editing, and estimating (VEE) measurement data

- Robust editing capabilities for scalar readings and interval measurement data

- Calculating and publishing bill determinants and other transactions from measurement data. This data is then used
in external systems; such as, billing, and pricing. It can also be applied to aggregation for settlement, load research,
forecasting, and revenue management.

- Service Issue Monitor configurable process to identify and correct devices that may have operating issues.

The system has a 360 Degree View device portal that provides advanced navigation and operational analytics to improve
operational efficiency. It is designed for handling large volumes of meter/device data to enable increased accuracy,
flexibility, and scalability.

##### Oracle Utilities Smart Grid Gateway Overview

Oracle Utilities Smart Grid Gateway (SGG) is designed as a messaging broker to communicate with meters and other
devices using a common interface. This allows the system to hide much of the background complexity that can occur when
multiple head end or meter data collection systems are used.

SGG functionality covers the following types of standardized processing.

- Loading usage and event data records that are collected on a frequent basis.

- Providing normalized raw data to other applications that require information with the ability to filter based on
requirements.

- Standardizing command and control use cases; such as, turning a meter device on or off, checking the current status of a
device, and requesting a measurement on-demand via electronic messages to the corresponding head end system.

- Centralizing command and data exceptions with the ability to automate retry processing.

SGG delivers pre-built adapters that support integrations to leading metering technology vendors. It also provides an
Adapter Development Kit (ADK) to easily integrate with other sources. The system can provide a single auditable link to
devices across all systems, simplify integrating with other utilities applications, and allowing normalized protocols and data
types. The platform can expand to allow other types of device and customer communications, beyond meters; or other types
of distribution and network devices that are upstream from the metering technology.

##### Oracle Utilities Service Order Management Overview

Oracle Utilities Service Order Management (SOM) delivers a new approach to handling the most common customer service
order use cases for smart metering technology and traditional metering. Rather than generating specific field activity tasks,
Oracle Utilities CCB triggers field activity requests that are based on the classic customer scenarios: start service, stop


-----

service, disconnect for non-payment, reconnect service, etc.. Oracle Utilities SOM receives these requests and determines
whether the installed device technology can support electronic commands (sending messages via Oracle Utilities SGG), or
not (meaning that a field visit is required to complete necessary tasks). Some situations may also require both automated
and manual activities to occur, and in a specific sequence; such as, first replacing an old meter with a smart meter through a
field visit, then sending a series of Oracle Utilities SGG messages to the new meter.

Oracle Utilities SOM continually monitors and initiates activities to get the service point, device, and completion fully
processed; this includes obtaining supporting data, such as measurements needed for billing, in a manner that is appropriate
for the associated meter’s technology. As more smart devices are installed in the field, Oracle Utilities SOM provides
increased savings by reducing field visits, and using more electronic messaging that take care of logic and error handling.

In addition to being initiated by the customer system, service order requests can also be initiated by other systems; for
example,

- Oracle Utilities Meter Data Management might detect service issue through its monitoring processes

- Oracle DataRaker’s advanced analytics might detect patterns with the meter, device, or customer behavior.

- Oracle Utilities Operational Device Management (ODM) might trigger operational processes; such as, periodic device
testing or configuration parameter updates.

It is critical for customer service business processes to see all types of requests that are initiated by other systems and their
current execution status. SOM assumes that a mobile workforce system is in use. These systems provide several important
functions: they remove the need for printed service orders, handle the assignment and scheduling of work to crews, and
provide appointment booking services.

##### Oracle Utilities Operational Device Management Overview

Oracle Utilities Operational Device Management provides functionality to handle large volumes of assets and to manage the
receipt, installation, maintenance, tracking and removal of those assets.

The system supports the following business processes:

- Capturing device attributes and supporting any type of device

- Supporting integration with other utility applications requiring device information and configuration

- Supporting detailed smart device attributes

- Supporting detailed location management and tracking of individual devices throughout their lifecycle

- Capturing device configurations and settings

- Managing configuration between devices, components and software

- Tracking firmware and firmware versions on smart devices

##### Oracle Utilities Market Settlements Management Overview

Oracle Utilities Market Settlements Management (MSM) provides the core functionality for calculating and settling energy
changes, also referred known as load settlement,.

Market settlement is the process of reconciling the difference between a supplier’s energy purchases and its customer’s
usage. Suppliers purchase energy via bilateral contracts and day-ahead market transactions. Any differences between these
purchases and supplier customer usage must be determined by the market and charged or credited at real time prices. The
supplier’s customer usage is not directly determined by the market, but by numerous other market participants that track
customer supplier enrollments, aggregate customer usage to the supplier, and submit supplier’s usage schedule to the
market.


-----

Load settlement starts with the bottom up aggregation of actual load or estimated load for individual customer accounts
or service points. Distribution and transmission losses are added in to calculate an unreconciled load amount. The
market determines the total generation supplied to a zone and the difference with the unreconciled load is referred to as
Unaccounted for Energy (UFE). The UFE is then allocated to suppliers on a load ratio share basis.

The load settlement process is typically performed multiple times. The “preliminary” load settlement is done soon after
the Operational Day and is often based on estimated load. The “final” load settlement is done around 60 days after the
Operational Day, so that actual data has been received and customer bills issued.

The market participant responsible for load settlement can differ per market. For example, load settlement for a large
portion of the Texas market is performed by an Independent System Operator (ISO) known as the Electric Reliability
Council of Texas (ERCOT), whereas in the PJM market (encompassing Pennsylvania, New Jersey, and Maryland) load
settlement is the responsibility of the Electric Distribution Company (EDC). While there are significant differences between
markets in how load settlement is preformed, the high-level process steps are basically the same.

-----

The pages within each functional area typically have two options: Search and Add. If the menu item does not have an Add
or Search option, select the menu item itself.

How the Search and Add option behaves depends upon whether the maintenance page is fixed or portal-based.

**Fixed:**

- **Search: Displays a pop-up search window for the user to enter the search criteria and select the entity to display. Once**
the entity is selected, the user is taken to the maintenance map with the data populated in the fields.

- **Add: Displays the maintenance page with empty fields so that the user can complete the information and save the entity.**

**Portal-Based:**

- **Search: Displays a search portal where the user can enter the search criteria and select the desired entity. Once the entity**
is selected, the user is typically taken to a maintenance portal or the information is broadcast to other zones within the
same portal.

- **Add: Either navigates to a page where the user can select the entity type or business object, or directly to the input map**
where the user can enter and save the entity.

Users may also opt to use Menu Item Search to find a page.

###### Admin Menu

The Admin menu icon,,is available in the application toolbar to help you navigate to the different pages of the
system. You only see the menu items that you have security access for. If you don't have security access to any of the
entries in this menu, then the whole menu is suppressed.

**Keyboard Shortcut**
```
Ctrl+Alt+A

```
Depending on how your implementation has configured the Admin menu list, it may be organized either by functional area
or alphabetically.

Clicking the Admin icon displays each functional area or alphabetical list. Clicking one of the options, in turn, displays a
submenu that contains pages within that area. The following is an example of the Admin menu organized functionally.


-----

**NOTE:** Menu navigation paths referenced in the administrative user guide provide the functional grouping. If your
implementation uses the alphabetic grouping, the page can be found in the alphabetic letter that is the first letter of the
page name.

**NOTE:** Refer to Installation Options for information about the admin menu configuration options.

The menu lines displayed for each menu entry typically have two options: Search and Add. If the menu item does not have
an Add or Search option, select the menu item itself. See Menu for more information about these options.

Users may also opt to use the Menu Item Search to find a page.

###### Back and Forward Arrows

The back and forward arrows,, in the application toolbar allow you to navigate between the most recently
viewed pages.


-----

###### Back

Click the Back arrow to open the previously visited page.

**Keyboard Shortcut**
```
Alt+B

###### Forward

```
Click the Forward arrow to return to the page that was most recently dismissed.

**Keyboard Shortcut**
```
Alt+G

```
The back and forward arrows are enabled in the toolbar only when page use warrants their appearance.

**NOTE:** Under certain circumstances, such as revisiting a page that was left unsaved after being loaded with default data,
a page may not appear as it did when you left it.

###### History Icon

Click the History icon,, to display a list of previously visited pages. When you click on an entry in the list to return
to an earlier page, all items above the selected page are removed from the list.

The back and forward arrows, as well as the History list, appear in the application toolbar only when page use warrants
their appearance.

Note that if the page has been configured to display an information string in the page title area, that information will also be
visible in the History dropdown.

**Keyboard Shortcut**
```
Ctrl+Alt+H

```

-----

###### Search

The toolbar Search field and search icon provide the ability to search for specific menu items or, depending on your
product, certain business entities.

###### Menu Item Search

This search allows a user to enter the description of a menu item entry to navigate directly to the corresponding page or
BPA script rather than using the menus to navigate to the desired page or script. Enter your search text starting with a slash
"/" to indicate that the search is confined to menu items.

Keyboard shortcut:

**Keyboard Shortcut**
```
Ctrl+Alt+F

```
Typing text in the field shows menu items whose descriptions include the typed text.

Note that only menu items within the Menu and Admin Menu that the user has security access for are included in the
results. The text included in the search is taken from the menu item description. As described in Menu, menu lines often
have two sub item: Search and Add. In most instances, the description of the "Search" menu item is simply the menu entry
text, for example To Do Entry. The description of the "Add" menu entry includes the word Add in front of the menu entry
text, for example Add To Do Entry.

As mentioned in Menu Item Suppression, menu items will not appear if it is associated with a module that is suppressed.

**NOTE:** When operating in debug mode, the description of the parent menu is displayed in parentheses after the menu
item description.

###### Unified Search

If your product has implemented unified search, you may use the toolbar search box to search for business entities. The
unified search feature is a simplified version of your product’s main search that allows you to lookup up records using free
form text without leaving your current page. For more complex queries, use the link provided as part of the search box to
navigate to your product's advanced search portal.


-----

The type of business entities you may query and the filters you may use depend on the specific unified search
implementation of your product. For example, if your product supports a search for customers based on their name or
address, you may type in part of a name or an address to find matching results. If a unified search option is not configured
for your product or you do not have security access to use it then the search box may only be used for searching for menu
items.

To search for business entities, you may enter your search criteria in the following ways:

- Type in your search text in free form. For example, if your product's unified search option supports a search for
customers by name or address, the text you enter may be considered as part of a name or an address.

- Depending on your product's unified search configuration, you may use specific hints to explicitly identify your filtering
criteria. For example, an address filter may be associated with the hint name "ad:" allowing you to be more explicit and
enter "ad: main" to find records by their address. Click the search icon in the search input area to view the hints that are
configured for this search. You can also click the up arrow adjacent to the hint to automatically populate the hint text into
the search.

- You may use free form text or hints but not both.

As you type in your text, the application attempts to find matching records and presents the top most results for your review.
You may select a record from the results list to navigate to the corresponding portal.

If your product has configured more than one unified search that you are allowed to use, one of the searches is the default
search. Click the search icon in the search input area to choose a different search option. After selecting a different option,
the hints for the selected search are shown and the Advanced Search link will navigate to the query portal configured for the
selected search.

Refer to your specific product documentation for more information about your product's unified search features.

Refer to Understanding Unified Search to better understand unified search configuration.

###### Help Menu

The Help menu is available in the application toolbar to provide access to the following product support options. Open the

menu by clicking the Help icon .

mode depening on its current state. If debug mode is currently not enabled, the entry says Enable Debug, otherwise it says
Disable Debug.

###### About

Select the About entry in the menu to display a window that describes the current release information for your version of
your product.

The about window shows a variety of information including:

- The logged in user ID

- The list of products installed in the application along with the release ID. This information comes from the installation
record. Note that in a Cloud installation, only the Cloud product name and release ID are displayed. The details of the
products that make up the Cloud installation are not displayed (but are still visible on the installation record).

###### User Menu

The User menu is available in the application toolbar to provide access to user-specific options. Open the menu by clicking

the User icon .

**NOTE:** **Configurable Menu. Additional menu entries may be visible in your implementation as this menu**
configuration allows for additional options to be defined.

Ctrl+Alt+L

###### Page Title Area

```
The Page Title Area displays the page title and the page actions toolbar.

For certain pages in the system, the page title may be followed by an information string. It is only applicable to portal-based
pages that display a single record. This information is only visible if the portal has been configured to display the primary
key’s information string. Typically only “stand alone” maintenance portals are configured to show the information string,
whereas “all-in-one” portals are not configured this way.

**FASTPATH:** Refer to Common Base Portals and Zones for more information about standard base product portals.

**NOTE:** If an information string is long and would interfere with a page actions button, the information string will
automatically be truncated and suffixed by an ellipsis, “…”, indicating that more information is available. In this
situation, the missing text can be viewed if the user hovers their mouse over the string.

The Page Actions Toolbar displays standard control options, such as Save and Duplicate. More detail about the actions that
may appear are described in the following section.

###### Page Actions Toolbar

In the Page Title Area, control functions appear in the Page Actions Toolbar; such as, Clear, Save, Duplicate, Delete and
Refresh buttons.

**NOTE:**
Buttons in the Page Title Area appear as the function is available to the user; for example, the Delete button will not
appear if the user has made any changes to the page’s content, or does not have the necessary security rights for this
action.

In addition, other functions that are specific to a portal-based page may appear in the toolbar, if configured. For
example, the ability to navigate to the Search zone for a specific maintenance object may be visible on the maintenance
portal.

This section describes the standard features that are available in the Page Actions Toolbar.


-----

###### Bookmark Button

Click the Bookmark button on the Page Actions Toolbar to save the current page and context to the bookmarks list.

**Keyboard Shortcut**
```
Ctrl+Alt+B

```
**NOTE:** **Secured. This button is secured using the application service F1-BOOKMARKS. Users that do not have**
security for the application service will not see the Bookmark button (or the corresponding dashboard zone).

After clicking the Bookmark button, you are prompted to provide a name for the bookmark. After saving, it is visible in the
Bookmarks Zone, allowing you to return to this page with this context loaded with one click.

**NOTE:** Unsaved data will not be included in the bookmark. If you view a record and make changes to data without
saving the changes and then bookmark the page, the unsaved changes are not included in the bookmark information.

You may change the name of the bookmark or change the sequence of the bookmarks by navigating to the User Bookmarks in the user preferences.

###### Next/Previous Item Buttons

The Previous Item and Next Item buttons appear in the Page Actions Toolbar under these conditions:

- You access a fixed page, meaning that it is not portal-based.

- You use a search page to display an item.

- There are multiple items in the search results list below or above the selected item.

If, for example, you enter search criteria of "Smith" on the User Search page, you might see the following results:

- Smith, Albert

- Smith, Peter

- Smith, Zane

If you select Smith, Peter, Peter's user information is displayed on the User page. If you then click the Next Item button,
**Smith, Zane will be displayed. In addition, because Smith, Zane is the last entry in the search results, the Next Item button**
is no longer needed and will not appear in the Page Actions Toolbar.

If you then click the Previous Item button, Smith, Peter will be displayed; click again and the Smith, Albert record will
appear, and, because Smith, Albert is the first entry in the search results, the Previous Item button is no longer needed and
will not appear in the Page Actions Toolbar.

**Keyboard Shortcut** **Alternate Shortcut**
```
Alt+P
Alt+N Alt+Shift+N

```
**NOTE:** Refer to Shortcut Key Summary for information about the alternate shortcut.


-----

###### Duplicate Button

Click the Duplicate button in the Page Actions Toolbar to create a duplicate of the currently selected object.

Before the new object is added to the database, a dialog appears in which you must enter the unique identifier for the
duplicate object. When you click OK, the system creates the record by copying the original record. It may be helpful to
think of the duplication function as the equivalent of a "save as" action.

**Keyboard Shortcut**
```
Ctrl+Alt+D

```
**NOTE:** Copying ancillary information for a record sometimes requires confirmation during a duplication request. If so,
you may also be asked if you also want to duplicate ancillary information. If, for example, you duplicate a user group,
besides supplying the ID of the new user group, you are asked if all users in the original user group should be linked to
the new user group.

This button does not appear in the Page Actions Toolbar when:

- Duplication is not supported for the current object.

- You are on a portal based page. (For these types of pages, if duplication is supported, the actions are defined in a zone on
the portal.)

- You have made changes to the object without committing the changes to the database by clicking Save. (After making
changes, you must either discard them using the Refresh button, or save them.)

###### Delete Button

Not all transactions have the capability to be deleted. Deletion is related to the business impact of the action. In some
transactions, Delete is present for some scenarios and unavailable for others; for example, you may not be able to delete a
record at a certain status level.

**NOTE:**
If you make a change to an object and do not save the changes to the database, you cannot delete the object until you
either save the changes or refresh the object with the contents on the database.

Before you delete an object, the system verifies that the object is not referenced anywhere in the system. If it is, you cannot
delete it. If, for example, you attempt to delete a user, the system ensures this user has not been referenced in a user group or
on a To Do.

Depending on the type of page that you are using, the option to delete may vary.

- Fixed pages display a Delete button in the page actions toolbar when the option is available.

- Portal-based pages display the Delete button in the object-related map.


-----

- List style fixed pages commonly display the Delete button (garbage can icon) next to the entity in the list.

In all cases, before the object is deleted, a confirmation dialog is displayed.

**CAUTION:** A timeout situation could occur as the system attempts to verify the use of the deleted object if the object is
referenced in many places and involves large volumes of production data. If this timeout situation occurs, you must with
your database administration group to delete the offending object.

###### Clear Button

Click the Clear button to remove the values from the currently displayed object’s fields. This action is typically used to
clear input fields when adding a new object.

**Keyboard Shortcut**
```
Ctrl+Alt+C

###### Save Button

```
Clicking the Save button saves any changes you have made in the data on the current object.

**Keyboard Shortcut** **Alternate Shortcut**
```
Alt+S Alt+Shift+S

```
**NOTE:** Refer to Shortcut Key Summary for information about the alternate shortcut.

The button does not appear unless:

- You enter a page in add mode and default values are loaded.

- You make changes to an object after it is displayed (note that you must tab or click out of the field before the Save button
appears).


-----

###### Refresh Button

Click the Refresh button to reload the values on the page with those from the database.

**CAUTION:** All unsaved changes are discarded.

**Keyboard Shortcut**
```
Alt+R

###### Object Display Area

```
The Object Display Area contains the details of the object(s) currently being viewed or maintained. For example, if you
display a portal, its zones are displayed in this area.

Because many of the page components follow Internet standards of operation, the behavior of these types of components are
not explicitly described. This section focuses on special features that are unique to the application framework.

###### Multiple Tabs

When a page in the application includes a lot of information, the page may be implemented with vertical scrolling to allow
the user to view all the information. Or alternatively, the page may be implemented with several tabs, allowing the user
to navigate between tabs to view or update information. The following image is a section of the User page showing the
multiple tabs.

**_Figure 1: Multiple Tabs Example_**

The names of the tabs describe the type of information that will be displayed in the page when the tab is clicked. For
example, if you click on the Favorite Links tab, the contents of the page show the favorite links configured for the user.


-----

**_Figure 2: Multiple Tabs Example (After Favorite Links Tab Is Clicked)_**

**NOTE:** **Hot key options. Rather than clicking on a tab, you can click Alt+F2 or Alt+Shift+F2 to scroll through**
the tabs. F2 moves you through the tabs from left to right. Shift+F2 moves you through the tabs from right to left.

**NOTE:** **Hot key options. Use Alt+ a number to navigate to the tab page whose relative position corresponds with the**
number. For example, if you press Alt+6 on the above page, the Favorite Links tab will be displayed. Alt+0 may be
used to navigate to the tenth tab. If there are more than 10 tabs on a page, you must use the mouse or F2 / Shift+F2 to
display additional tabs. Note that the numeric keypad on your keyboard cannot be used to implement this function.

**NOTE:** **Returning to a page that contains multiple tabs. If you return to a page (by clicking the Back arrow or the**
History icon), the page will be positioned on the last tab that was opened.

**NOTE:** **Page versus Tab nomenclature. The documentation frequently refers to the contents of a given tab as a page.**
However, the page actually comprises the entire collection of tabs.

###### Text Box

The following is an example of a basic text box:

If the text box is a large field, the text box may be configured to enable scrolling. In this situation, an expanded edit icon, (a
pencil), will appear adjacent to it.

Additional capabilities are provided to display and edit data in these text boxes:

- If the field contains more text than is visible, a pop-up that displays the full text appears when you hover your mouse
over the text box. The text in the pop-up can be selected and copied.


-----

- If you click the expanded edit icon, an editable pop-up window appears. If the field is not protected as a result of
business rules for the page, you may modify the text in this window.

**NOTE:** The following table highlights special characters that are converted to equivalent standard characters when
entered in a text box.

**Entered Character Description** **Unicode** **Converted Character Description**

Curly left double quote. U+201D Straight double quote.

Curly right double quote. U+201C Straight double quote.

Curly left single quote. U+2019 Straight single quote.


-----

**Entered Character Description** **Unicode** **Converted Character Description**

Curly right single quote. U+2018 Straight single quote.

En dash. U+2013 Simple hyphen.

Em dash. U+2014 Simple hyphen.

Ellipse U+2026 Three dots.

Middle dot (bullet / centered dot) U+00B7 Asterisk.

Fraction 1/4 (using 1 character). U+00BC 1/4 (using three separate characters).

Fraction 1/2 (using 1 character). U+00BD 1/2 (using three separate characters).

Fraction 3/4 (using 1 character). U+00BE 3/4 (using three separate characters).

###### Date and Time Fields

When both the date and time are required, the Date and Time fields typically look as follows:

When only the date is required, the Date field looks as follows:

When only the time is required, the Time field looks as follows:

If you click on the calendar icon or press the Enter key while the cursor is positioned to the left of the icon in a Date or Date
and Time field, the following window appears:

Click or press enter to select the date and populate the input field. Use the left and right arrows to scroll back or forward a
month. Click on the ‘Month’ text to bring up a range of months to select from. Click on the year to bring up a range of years
to select from.

If you click on the clock icon or press the Enter key while the cursor is positioned to the left of the icon in a Time or Date
and Time field, the following window appears:


-----

Select the hour then click or press enter on the minutes to select the time and populate the input field.

###### Search Button

The search button appears primarily as a magnifying glass.

When using a pop-up search window, the search button can appear as a button with its function labeled.

You can have the system search for an item that matches the data you entered using any of the following methods:

- Enter a value in the search field and press Enter while the cursor is in the search field. The system assumes you want to
search for the value entered and pre-populates it in the search window's search criteria. If a unique match can be found,
the system automatically populates the field with details corresponding to the record found. If a unique match cannot be
found (either no matches or multiple matches), a search page opens containing selectable items.

- Click the Search button without entering a criteria. This will typically cause a pop-up search window to appear so that
you can further refine your search.

- Enter a value and tab out of the search field. The system looks for a value that exactly matches what you entered. If it
cannot find such a value, the search dialog will not be presented.

When an item is selected in the search page, the search page closes and the input field is populated with the value selected.

**NOTE:** **Sorting columns within the search grid. You may click on the column heading of columns in a search grid to**
cause the contents of the grid to be sorted. Refer to Sorting Functionality for more information.


-----

###### Context Menu Button

The Context Menu button is a small arrow that appears adjacent to an object's value or information string. An example is
shown below:

Context menus exist to help you navigate to other pages and populating the page with the current context (by passing the ID
of the related object). In addition, the menu items offered in a Context Menu differ depending on the entity that the menu is
related to; for example, when you click the Algorithm Type context menu, a pop-up menu similar to this appears:

Different context menus exist for each of the major objects in the system; for example, in Customer Care and Billing, the
context menu for Premise contains premise-oriented menu items, whereas the context menu for Account contains accountoriented menu items.

###### Go To Button

Clicking a Go To button,, opens the page for the related object - it functions like a hyperlink.

###### Broadcast Button

Some zones have been configured to "broadcast" unique identifiers to other zones within the portal; if so, you'll see a

broadcast icon,, in the first column. Clicking the icon causes specific zones to reload - these zones that have been
configured to rebuild when the unique identifier is received. For example, you might have configured a zone to display the
image of a bill when a bill ID is broadcast from an info zone.

###### Embedded Help Icon

The icon containing a small 'i' is an Embedded Help icon.

When an embedded help icon is clicked, a tool tip appears containing additional information.

###### Work Lists

The work list buttons can appear in a zone's column heading, .


-----

Clicking the icon results in populating the dashboard Work List Zone with the entire column. The user may use the Work
List zone to easily process entries one at a time without returning back to the source query zone.

**NOTE:** The Work List zone is populated only upon user request.

###### Scroll Bars with Dynamic Height

Sometimes the height of a grid isn't sufficient to display a grid's rows. When this occurs, a vertical scroll bar appears and

an "expand button" appears above this bar, . For example, the following grid is not high enough to show all of a the
available dashboard zones:

If you want to view all of the available zones without using the vertical scroll bar, you can you click the expand button.
When clicked, the height of the grid expands to show all rows in the grid:

Notice, after the grid is expanded, the grid's vertical scroll bar disappears and the button in the upper corner becomes a

Collapse Button, . If you click the collapse button, the grid will return to its original height.

**NOTE:** **Search grids. Expand all functionality is not available in search grids.**


-----

###### Sorting Functionality

Grids have a heading row that contains labels for the columns. By clicking a column heading, you cause the rows to be
sorted in the order of the selected column. By clicking on a column more than once, you cause the rows to be sorted in
reverse order. Clicking the heading a third time removes the sorting function and returns the grid to its default display
organization.

The following shows how information look after organizing the grid, clicking the column heading, by algorithm type (notice
the icon in the column name).

**NOTE:** **Sorting on dropdown values. If you attempt to sort a column that contains a dropdown value, the information**
is sorted in the order of the unique identifier associated with the dropdown value, not the description you see on the
screen; for example, if you sort on a column containing unit of measure, the information will be sorted in the order of
the unit of measure code, not the description that appears in the drop down. This means that the resultant sort will appear
incorrect and therefore we discourage you from doing this.

###### Get More Functionality

Grids in fixed pages that can potentially contain a large number of rows have special processing that we refer to as Get
More functionality. Rather than show every row, the system retrieves the first X records (where X varies from grid to grid,
and from release to release) and appends a Get More button to the bottom of the grid:

When you click the Get More button, the system appends the next X rows to the bottom of the grid.

**NOTE:** **The absence of a "get more" button. For pages configured to include Get More, if no button appears at the**
bottom of the grid, this means all of the rows are displayed.

**NOTE:** **Search grids. The Get More function is not available in search grids.**

###### Adding and Removing Rows Using Arrows

In some editable grids, a new row can be added to another editable grid (the grid on the left) by clicking the Add item

button,, of the desired row in the grid on the right:


-----

When the Remove item button is clicked,, the row is transferred from the grid on the right to the grid on the left. This
change will not be committed to the database until you save the object being maintained

###### Reorganizing Items Using the Up and Down Arrows

Occasionally, rows can be repositioned in an editable grid by clicking up and down arrows. The following is an example of
such a grid:

Notice the following about such a grid:

- The up arrow is dim in the first row. This is because it can't be moved further to the top.

- The down arrow is dim in the last row. This is because it can't be moved further down.

- The up and down arrows are usable in all other rows. Each time you click one of these arrows, the respective row is
moved up or down one row.

**NOTE:** **Reminder. When you move rows into a grid, the system does not apply the change to the database until you**
click the Save button (which commits the entire object to the database).

###### Trees

Trees are used to illustrate complex relationships between objects. The following is an example from Oracle Utilities
Customer Care and Billing of a page with a tree that is expanded:


-----

The following points describe how to use trees:

You can expand and contract the nodes in a tree by clicking on the icon that prefixes the node (you can also click the arrows
to expand and contract a node).

**NOTE:** **Expand all. If you press Ctrl while clicking on an icon that prefixes a node, all child nodes (and their**
children) expand.

You can click the context menu button to cause a context menu to appear. You can navigate to any of the pages that are
presented on this menu. Refer to Context Menu Button for more information.

You can click on the information that appears in an underlined node to drill into the page in which the object is maintained.
For example, if you click on the account information, you will be transferred to the Account - Main page.

**NOTE:** **Important! If you make changes after expanding a tree's nodes (e.g., by drilling down on a Premise and**
changing the premise's address), the tree will contract to the first node if you return to the page.

Nodes in trees fit into two broad categories:

- **Information nodes. Information nodes highlight the existence of other data. For example, on the Control Central - Bill**
Payment Tree, a node exists to highlight the existence of new financial transactions that were created since the last bill
was completed.


-----

- **Data nodes. Data nodes show information about objects in the system. For example, data nodes exist on the Control**
Central - Bill Payment Tree that show bills and payments.

###### Required Field Indicator

An asterisk (*) is used to indicate that a field is required. The system determines this based on the field's configuration.
When a field becomes required because of an algorithm and not the field's configuration, however, the system will not add
an asterisk.

**NOTE:**
If a page includes a grid, fields within a row may be marked as required.

In this situation, the field(s) within the grid are only required if the row is being populated.

###### Accordion Windows

Accordion windows are used when the data held in an object's rows does not comfortably fit into a grid.

Each row in an accordion has a header that summarizes a row's details. When you click a header, the row expands to show
the details. The following is an example of an accordion where all headers are collapsed (meaning that only summaries of
the rows' details are shown):

When you expand a header, its details are exposed. For example, the following shows the same accordion after the third row
is expanded:


-----

**NOTE:** **You must expand to update. In order to update a row in an accordion, you must expand it.**

###### Row Summary and Chunk Management

At the top of an accordion you'll find a summary of its rows. The format of this information differs depending on the
number of rows and the size of the accordion:

- If the accordion contains every row, a summary of the total number of rows is displayed.

- If the accordion contains a subset of rows, you are presented with a summary of the rows AND you are provided with
options to display different "chunks" of rows.

  - Click First to display the first "chunk" of rows (the size of a chunk differs depending on the accordion). This option is
dimmed if the first chunk is in the accordion.

  - Click Previous to display the previous chunk of rows. This option is dimmed if the first chunk is in the accordion.

  - Click Next to display the next chunk of rows. This option is dimmed if the last chunk is in the accordion.

  - Click Last to display the last chunk of rows. This option is dimmed if the last chunk is in the accordion.

###### Dashboard Area

The dashboard is a portal that contains zones. These zones appear regardless of the object being displayed in the Object
Display Area. Refer to Dashboard Portal for a description of these zones. Every user has control over the zones that appear
in their dashboard. Refer to Portal Preferences for more information about how a user can customize the contents of the
dashboard.

The dashboard area is displayed before the Object Display area by default. (On the left for a left-to-right language and on
the right for a right-to-left language). You have control over its location, width and more as part of your user preferences.

###### Script Area

When a script is initiated, the object display area shifts down to make room for the script area.


-----

The information in the script area takes you through the steps in the selected business process (provided by your
implementation team).

##### Portal Pages

This section describes using portals and zones to find and display information. This is the preferred technique used by the
base product for building user interfaces.

Additionally, portals and zones may be configured by your implementation to supplement the base package provided
functionality.

The contents of this section provide background information about portal page behavior.

###### Portals Are Made Up Of Zones

The term "zone" is used to describe a section on a portal. Each zone has a heading and content.

**Keyboard Shortcuts** **Description**

`Alt+]` Moves the cursor focus to the next zone on the page based on the
standard browser keyboard navigation "order".

`Shift+Alt+]` Moves the cursor focus to the previous zone on the page based on the
standard browser keyboard navigation "order".

The following is a portal with seven zones:

- Switch Language

- Bookmarks

- Checked Out

- Current Context

- Current To Do

- Favorite Links

- Favorite Scripts

**NOTE:** This example may not be available in your application; it is used for illustration purposes only.


-----

###### Users Must Be Granted Security Access To Each Zone

A user must be security granted access rights in order to see a zone on a portal.

**FASTPATH:** Refer to Granting Access to Zones for information .

###### Zones May Appear Collapsed When A Page Opens

Zones may be designed to appear collapsed (or minimized) when the portal is initially displayed. To view the information in

a collapsed zone, the user can press the zone's expansion button,, to either expand or collapse the zone:


-----

A zone's data is only retrieved when it is expanded.

###### Some Portals Allow User Customization

There are some portals in each base product that are configured to allow user customization. In this case, the portal is visible
on the user's portal preferences. For these portals each user has control over the following:

- Which zones appear on their portal

- The order in which the zones appear

- Whether the zones should be "collapsed" (i.e., minimized) when the portal opens.

Users define their preferences by clicking the User Preferences button. Pressing this button transfers the user to the User
Preferences page on which their Portal Preferences can be defined.

Portals used for base product query and maintenance pages are typically configured to not allow user customization.

###### Dashboard Portal

The dashboard is a special portal that always appears on the desktop. Its zones contain tools and data that are useful
regardless of the object being displayed.

**NOTE:**
**Minimize the dashboard. You can minimize the dashboard by clicking on the vertical bar between the dashboard**
and the object display area. This causes the dashboard portal to disappear and displays a single vertical dashboard
bar, allowing more of the page area to display. It also suppresses the refresh of the zones within the dashboard based
on updates to the context. Clicking the dashboard bar restores the display of the dashboard portal. Maximizing the
dashboard then refreshes the zones with the latest appropriate content.

**Minimize the dashboard when launching the system. If desired, a URL parameter may be used to minimize the**
dashboard when launching the system, using the parameter minDashboard=true. Refer to Creating Application Links
in External Applications for more information and examples.

**Adjusting the dashboard width. You can adjust the width of the dashboard by moving the slider that separates the**
dashboard from the object display area. This also updates your user preferences with the new width.

**Keyboard Shortcut**
```
Alt+J

```
The contents of this section describe the zones that are provided by the framework product for this portal. Please note the
following additional information about the dashboard portal that may impact how it appears.

- **Additional zones may be available in other products. The zones described below are available in every base product.**
Please refer to the product-specific documentation for additional dashboard zones available in your product (open the
help and navigate to the index entry labeled Dashboard).

- **Context Sensitive Zones may appear. Some pages may define additional zones that should appear in the dashboard**
only if that page is displayed. These are referred to as Context Sensitive Zones.

- **Dashboard zones are configurable. The dashboard portal is configured to allow a user to define preferences for it.**
Refer to Portal Preferences for more information.


-----

**NOTE:** **Security. As a general rule, dashboard zones each refer to a unique application service so that a security**
administrator may configure which users are allowed to have access to which zones. Note that the user portal
preferences indicates which zones a user has security access to.

###### Bookmarks Zone

After clicking the Bookmark button and saving a bookmark, it is visible in the Bookmarks zone. Clicking one of the links
in the zone navigates to the page where the bookmark was saved and loads the information related to the record that was
displayed when the bookmark was saved.

Click the trash can icon to delete the bookmark.

Note that a user may change the name of the bookmark or change the sequence of the bookmarks by navigating to the User Bookmarks in the user preferences.

###### Tags Zone

The Tags zone provides a quick way to associate the entity currently being displayed with an entity tag or remove any of
the tags it current has. Tagging an entity may be useful to highlight various contexts in which it can be used, for example for
testing or reporting purposes. Refer to Defining Entity Tags for more information.

Note that the zone is visible only when there is an entity in context, i.e. there is an entity to tag, and the user has application
security access to this zone.

###### Collect Entity Zone

The Collect Entity zone provides a quick way to add or remove the entity currently being displayed to and from the
migration request in context. This is mainly useful when reviewing data to export and while doing so maintain the export
list. The zone automatically appears once an Entity List migration request is visited and set in context.

###### Current To Do Zone

The Current To Do zone is designed to streamline the process of working on To Do entries from assignment to completion.
It displays key information about the user's current To Do entry and provides functions that help minimize the number of
steps it takes to resolve the entry and potentially other entries related to it.

The following sections provide more detail about the zone.

###### Next To Do Assignment

Users may have the option to click the Assign me a To Do button to request the next To Do entry they should work on.
This functionality is optional and can be configured to follow your organization's business rules in determining the next task
for a user. For example, if your organization practices work distribution "on demand", this feature can be configured to find
the highest priority entry a user can work on and assign it to the user. Refer to work distribution for more information on
this business practice.

**NOTE:** **Next To Do Assignment Rules Are In A Plug-in. Refer to Installation Options for more information on how to**
configure the system to take advantage of this function.

If the system is successful in determining the next entry the user should work on, this entry becomes the user's current To
Do and its information is displayed on the zone.


-----

###### User’s Current To Do

The user's current To Do may be set using the Next Assignment algorithm, or by drilling in on a To Do from the To Do List
or To Do Search page as described in A User's Current To Do. Once a current To Do has been set, the zone displays details
related to the To Do.

The Message describes why the entry exists. The message description allows the user to drill into the page on which the
entry's respective object is displayed. For example, if the entry is associated with an asset that needs review, the user is
brought to the asset page to view the information and potentially take action. If the To Do type has been configured to
associate a script with this To Do entry's message number, then instead of being taken to the respective page, the associated
script is launched.

**Info displays the standard To Do information. An icon** appears if there are comments on the To Do and a Log Entry

icon appears if there is a log entry of type Forwarded, Sent Back or User Details on the To Do. The description
drills into the To Do entry page allowing the user to view more information about the entry or make changes to it as needed.

The user may use the Complete button in the zone to complete the current entry.

###### Next / Previous Buttons

The Previous and Next buttons are enabled on this zone under the following conditions:

- The user selected an entry either on the To Do List page or the To Do Search page.

- At least one other entry exists below (for Next) or above the entry selected (for Previous).

Clicking Next or Previous will bring the user to the transaction indicated on the To Do Entry's message, where its
respective object is displayed. It also makes that To Do the Current To Do displayed in the zone.

**Keyboard Shortcut** **Comments** **Alternate Shortcut**

`Alt+Y` Previous To Do

`Alt+Z` Next To Do `Alt+Shift+Z`

**NOTE:** Refer to Shortcut Key Summary for information about the alternate shortcut.

**NOTE:** When a user drills down on a To Do entry from the To Do List page, the system automatically changes the
status of the entry to Being Worked. If Next To Do or Previous To Do is subsequently used to scroll through this list,
the system does not change the To Do entry's status. To change the status of these entries, the user must navigate to the
To Do List. On this page, multiple entries may be selected and their status changed with a single user-interface action.

###### Related To Do Entries

If the To Do entry has non-complete related entries a summary Related To Do description appears. The description states
the total number of related entries, how many are still in Open, how many are assigned to current user and how many
assigned to others. This hyperlink navigates to the To Do Search query allowing the user to review the related entries. At
this point the user may decide to assign entries that can be positively identified as being caused by the same problem as the
current To Do also to himself.

If at least one related To Do entry is Open or also assigned to the current user, the Complete All button is visible. If the
user determines that the related To Do entries have been resolved with the appropriate action taken, the button may be used
to complete in one step the current entry and all related entries that are Open or assigned to the current user.

If the related entries are not resolved with one action, the user may opt to use the Complete button to complete the current
entry alone and work on related entries one at a time. Using the related To Do information hyperlink the user may navigate


-----

to the To Do search page and drill into the first related To Do to work on using the message hyperlink. This entry now
becomes the user's current To Do and the Next and Previous action buttons are set to scroll through the related entries list.

###### Favorite Links Zone

Each line in the Favorite Links Zone corresponds with one of the user's favorite links (e.g., transactions). Clicking on a
line invokes the transaction. The first nine entries can be invoked by pressing an accelerator key (Ctrl + the number of the
relative position of the link in the list). Note that the numeric keypad on your keyboard cannot be used to implement this
function.

Users define their favorite links by clicking the User Preferences button. Clicking this button transfers the user to the User
Preferences page on which their Favorite Links can be defined.

###### Favorite Scripts Zone

The Favorite Scripts zone lists the business process assistant (BPA) scripts that you have defined on your user preferences.
You can click on a script to execute it. You can click the Search button in the zone to search for other scripts.

**NOTE:** If you do not see the Favorite Scripts zone in your dashboard, navigate to User Menu and click the Preferences
menu item to display the User - Portal Preferences page. Under the Dashboard Portal row, select the Display option for
the Favorite Scripts zone.

###### Favorite Searches Zone

If you marked a saved search as a favorite using Saved Searches functionality, the search is visible in the Favorite Searches
zone. Clicking one of the links in the zone navigates to the page where the search was saved and populates the filter values
and executes the search.

###### Switch Language Zone

The Switch Language zone is used to switch the application's language. Only languages that are supported by your
implementation will appear.

To switch the application's language, choose the desired language and press the Refresh button.

**NOTE:** If your implementation uses a single language, you should suppress this zone by not granting security rights to
the zone's application service.

###### To Do Summary Zone

The To Do Summary Zone has several purposes:

- It presents a summary of the To Do entries that have been assigned to you and are Being Worked On.

- The colored "age bars" highlight the age of the To Do entries. The colors red, yellow and green are used to highlight
the relative number of old, middle-aged and new To Do entries. The age associated with each of these colors is userconfigurable. Note, you can hover the cursor over an "age bar" to see the number of To Do entries.

- If you click on the To Do Type description, you'll be transferred to the To Do Management portal where these To Do
entries will be displayed. From this page, you can drill down to the specific entries.


-----

**NOTE:** **Time saver! Use the worklist button when working on an entry in the To Do Management portal. All the**
individual To Do entries will be visible in the Worklist dashboard zone, allowing you to work through additional To Do
entries without returning to the To Do Management portal.

###### Work List Zone

The Work List zone is populated when a user click the Work Listsicon in an info or query zone. When you click the link
of the work list entry, the system does whatever it would have done if you had clicked on the hyperlink in the zone. The
system marks the current entry with a star. It marks any previously worked entry with a checkmark.

Previous and Next buttons are available in the zone allowing you to go to the next or previous entry without having to locate
it yourself and click the link.

You may actively mark an entry to be ignored by the Previous or Next button by clicking the icon column for that entry. An
icon of an eye with a slash through it is visible. You can click the icon to re-include that entry in the previous / next action.

The work list stays populated until you either click the Clear link in the zone's dashboard or you overlay the work list by
clicking a different column's work list icon.

The image shows a work list zone illustrating that the first entry was "visited", the second entry is the current one being
viewed and the fourth entry is marked to skip or ignore.

###### Zone Types and Characteristics

The topics in this section describe common zone types, function, and common characteristics.

**FASTPATH:** Refer to The Big Picture of Portals and Zones for a description of general portal and zone functionality.


-----

###### Common Characteristics of Zones

The following topics describe common characteristics of all zone types supported by the base package.

###### Zone Visibility

A zone may be configured to dynamically be visible or completely hidden depending on the information being displayed.
When hidden, not even the header is displayed.

For configuration information, refer to Zone Visibility Service Script.

###### Control Zone Headers

A zone may reference a UI Map to define and control its header. This feature provides the means to achieve a uniform look
and feel for the application as well as add functionality to the zone header beyond being just a title bar to open and close the
zone. Refer to UI Map and to its context sensitive tips zone for more information on Fragment UI Maps and how they are
used to construct zone headers.

###### Explorer Zones

The product provide several zone types that are used to find or display a set of information. These are called explorer zones.
There are two types of explorer zones:

- **Info zones. An info zone displays a list of information about an object. These types of zones often display information**
without requiring any input from the user.

- **Query zones. A query zone allows users to find objects matching a given search criteria.**

Virtually every aspect of an info or query zone is controlled by its zone configuration. However, most share basic common
components described in the subsequent sections.

###### Search Criteria / Filter Area

For query zones, the Search Criteria Area (also called Filter Area) contains the criteria used to find objects. The design of
the zone controls the number and type of filters that appear in this area. After search criteria is entered, clicking the Search
button causes the system to look for records that match the criteria. The results are shown in the Results Area.

The system automatically collapses the filter area to allow more space for displaying the results. At that time the Expand
**Filters button may be used to open the filter area to enter different criteria. When the filter area is expanded the Hide**
**Filters button may be used to collapse the filter area again without performing a new search.**

For info zones, the zone's configuration indicates whether or not a Filter area is applicable and if so, whether or not it is
open or closed by default. If the filter area is configured, the Show Filter icon is visible in the zone header. Click this icon
to expose the Filter Area, if it is not visible and click the icon to hide the Filter Area if desired. Use this area to filter the
information that appears in the zone by different values. Click the Search button to rebuild the Results Area using the
specified filters.

For example, the following shows an info zone listing user groups that do not have access to a given Application Service
where a filter area has been configured to allow users to show user groups specific to a given user by ID or name.


-----

The info zone includes configuration to indicate whether the filter area, when exposed, should be shown at the top of the
zone (above the results) or at the bottom of the zone (below the results). For query zones, the search criteria is always
displayed at the top.

**NOTE:** **Press Enter. Rather than clicking the Search button, you can press Enter to trigger the search / info zone**
refresh.

###### Description Bar

The Description Bar describes the search criteria that were used to build the Search Results Area.

###### Results Area

The Results Area displays the appropriate list of objects. For an info zone, this is the list of appropriate objects with any
input filter criteria considered. The following is an example of the results for an info zone. For a query zone, this is the list
that matches the search criteria defined in the Filter Area. The following is an example of the results set of an Info Zone.

For a query zone, the columns that appear may differ depending on the search criteria. For example, if you search for a
customer by their driver's license number, the resulting columns may be different than the ones displayed when you search
by customer name.

The following points highlight details related to viewing and working with the result set:

**Broadcast. If the results set is configured to display a broadcast icon,**, it means that at least one other zone on the
portal is configured to display data related to the record selected in the results list. Clicking this icon will cause the other
zone or zones to be built or refreshed to display related data.

- **Hypertext. One or more columns in the zone may be configured as hypertext. Clicking the hypertext will result in**
navigating to another page to display data related to that column based on the configuration for that column.


-----

- **Maximum height. The maximum height of the report area is controlled by the zone's configuration. A vertical scroll will**
appear when more rows exist than fit into the height.

- **Maximum rows. The maximum number of rows that can appear is controlled by the zone's configuration. Excess rows**
are truncated before display. Please note, you can configure the zone to download more rows to Excel than appear in the
Results Area.

- **Control column sorting. By default zones are designed to allow a user to sort the results list by clicking any column**
heading. Clicking once sorts ascending. Clicking again sorts descending. However, a zone may be configured to not
allow this type of sorting.

**Work list. Columns may be configured to enable the work list icon,** . Clicking this pushes all the data into the Work
List zone.

- **Rearranging columns. A zone may be configured to allow a user to rearrange columns and add or remove columns**
visible in the Result Area. Refer to Column Configuration for the details.

The type and variety of columns that appear in the Results Area is controlled by the zone's configuration.

###### Title Bar

The Title Bar contains the zone's description along with other icons and functions described in this section.

In the corner of the Title Bar, you'll see an indicator that tells you whether the zone is collapsed (e.g., minimized) or
expanded. Each time you click the indicator, the zone toggles between expanded and collapsed. The following image shows
a collapsed zone.

**NOTE:** Recommendation: For zones that are configured to show on portal preferences, set up Portal Preferences to
collapse zones that aren't needed every time a portal is displayed. Rationale: The system doesn't build collapsed zones
when a portal is displayed. Instead, collapsed zones are only built when a user expands them. Thus, indicating a zone is
collapsed improves response times.

If the zone is configured with help text, a help icon appears to the right of the zone title. Click this icon to view the help text.

If a saved search is open for a zone, the name of the saved search is displayed after the zone title.

The following sections describe additional icons and tools visible on the title bar. Note that in addition to the information
described in this section, additional actions that are specific to a zone may appear based on configuration. The actions may
appear in the form of hypertext, an icon or a button.

###### Explorer Zone Menu

Click the Explorer Zone Menu icon to list available tools. The following topics describe each tool.

###### Clear Filters

Click the Clear Filters link in the Explorer Zone menu to clear the filter values and zone data.

###### Export to Excel

Click the Export to Excel link in the Explorer Zone menu to download the zone's data to Excel. This link is hidden if the
zone has been configured to not download rows to Excel.

Please note the following with respect to this feature:


-----

- Clicking export performs the search because it is possible to configure a number of records for excel that differs from the
number of records configured to display.

- Because the search is performed, you can request an export to Excel even without first searching on the zone. The filters
populated (or not populated) at time of exporting are the ones used for the export. If the user did not search at all or did a
search and then changed the filters and exported before searching again, the results in the export may not match what is
visible on the zone.

- It is possible through zone configuration to mark columns that are visible to the user interface as suppressed in the
export. Conversely, it's also possibly to mark columns as suppressed on the user interface but included in Excel. As such,
the columns visible in the export may not always match what is visible in the user interface. This applies when for zones
that support configurable columns. Columns removed from view through this technique are still included in the export if
not marked to suppress.

- If the column results include any HTML, the HTML is stripped out before exporting to Excel.

###### Print

Click the Print Zone link in the Explorer Zone menu to print the zone.

###### Save Search Options

Query zones and info zones that include filter areas, allow a user to capture and save filter criteria so that the same search
can be more quickly executed in the future. Users may save many different search options for the same zone. Users also
have the option to nominate one search as the default so that this search is automatically loaded upon entering the zone.
In addition, users may choose to set one or more searches as a Favorite, which causes the search to appear in the Favorite
Searches zone in the dashboard. This allows a user to navigate to the portal for that zone and load the saved search in one
click.

The Explorer Menu includes various options for supporting Saved Searches that are described below.

Note the following additional points about this functionality:

- **Click Search before Saving. When a user wants to save a search, the search criteria should be entered and the Search**
button should be clicked prior to saving the search.

- **Criteria is saved, not results. Although a user must click Search prior to saving the search, the system saves the**
criteria, but not the results. When returning to the query or info zone in the future and opening a given saved search, the
results displayed will be the current records in the system that match the saved search criteria.

- **Multi-Query Zones. When a user is on a multi-query zone, the searches are saved at the multi-query zone level so that**
all saved searches for the various search dropdowns for a given multi-query zone are visible in the Open Saved Searches
menu option.

- **Functionality is Secured. If for any reason an implementation wishes to restrict which users are allowed to save**
searches, the functionality is securable. Only users with Inquire access to the F1_USRFAVSCH application service will
see these options in the explorer menu. This is the same application service that is used to provide access to the Favorite
Searches dashboard zone.

Save As
The Save As... option in the Explorer Zone menu allows a user to save the current entered search criteria. This should be
clicked after executing the search.

The user is prompted to provide a name for the search. This search is now available from the Open Saved Searches option.
If desired, a user can also choose to make this search the Default or may choose to Add to Favorites.

This option is visible whether or not an existing saved search is loaded. When a saved search is loaded, this option allows a
user to make changes to the search criteria and save a new search with that criteria.

Open Saved Search


-----

The Open Saved Search... option in the Explorer Zone menu is visible if there are any saved searches for the zone that is
currently visible. Select this menu entry to view the current list of saved searches for the zone. For multi-query zones, any
saved search for any of the query zones that are part of the multi-query zone are visible. Choose the desired saved search.
The criteria is updated with this information and the search is performed.

Save
The Save option in the Explorer Zone menu is visible if a Saved Search is already loaded. This option allows a user to save
changes to the criteria of an existing saved search (overwriting the previously saved criteria).

Set As Default
The Set As Default option in the Explorer Zone menu is only visible if a saved search is loaded and it is not currently the
default. Click this option to nominate this search to be the one that is loaded when navigating to this zone from the menu.

Remove As Default
The Remove As Default option in the Explorer Zone menu is only visible if a saved search is loaded and it is currently the
default. Click this option to no longer load this search automatically when navigating to this zone from the menu.

Add To Favorites
The Add To Favorites option in the Explorer Zone menu is only visible if a saved search is loaded and it is not currently
included in the favorite searches zone. Click this option to include this search in the Favorite Searches zone. Once a search
is in the Favorite Searches zone, you can use the link to the search in the dashboard to navigate to the portal for this zone
and load the saved search in one click.

**NOTE:** **Not available for dependent zones There are some portals that include a zone that is not the main query or info**
zone on the portal, but is rather a zone providing additional information for a record that is displayed. If a zone like this
has filter options or configurable columns, a user is able to save searches and mark one as a default, but will not be able
to add the saved search to favorites because the zone is dependent on other data on the page that is not captured for the
individual zone.

**NOTE:** **Dashboard Zone Preferences. Be sure that your portal preferences are configured to include the Favorite**
Searches dashboard zone.

Remove From Favorites
The Remove From Favorites option in the Explorer Zone menu is only visible if a saved search is loaded and it is currently
included in the Favorite Searches zone. Click this option when you want to keep the saved search but you no longer want it
visible in your Favorite Searches zone. (Deleting a saved search that is also marked as a favorite will automatically remove
the search from the favorite searches zone.)

Delete
The Delete option in the Explorer Zone menu is only visible if a saved search is loaded. Click this option to remove the
currently opened saved search from the list of saved searches.

Note that if the saved search had been configured as favorite, deleting the saved search remove it from the favorite searches
zone.

###### Show Filters

Click the Show Filters icon to show the Filter Area. This button only appears if the zone has been configured to have
filters.

**NOTE:** If the zone is configured to have filters and the drag and drop (column configuration) area, only one or the other
is shown at any given time. It means that a user can either change the filter criteria and refresh the search results or
change the column configuration and refresh the results.


-----

###### Show Column Configuration Area

Click the Column Configuration icon to show the Column Configuration Area. This button only appears if the zone
has been configured to allow columns to be dragged and dropped into the Results Area.

**NOTE:** If the zone is configured to have filters and the drag and drop (column configuration) area, only one or the other
is shown at any given time. It means that a user can either change the filter criteria and refresh the search results or
change the column configuration and refresh the results.

###### The Open Zone Maintenance Icon

Click the Go To Zone icon to switch to the zone's zone maintenance page. On this page, you can change the
parameters that control the zone's behavior.

**NOTE:** **Debug mode only. This icon only appears when the system operates in Debug mode.**

###### Configurable Columns

Info zones and query zones may be configured to allow users to rearrange columns and to remove or add columns to the
output. This is also referred to as "drag and drop" of columns.

When a zones is configured to support this functionality, the Show Column Configuration Area icon is visible in the zone
title area. Click this icon to expose the Column Configuration Area, if it is not visible and click the icon to hide the Column
Configuration Area if desired.

If configurable columns are allowed, a user may rearrange the order of columns currently displayed in the Results Area by
clicking the column heading and "dragging" it to the desired location.

In addition, the column configuration area may display columns that are not currently in the Results Area. These are
indicated by a cream background. A user can drag one of these columns to the results area and then click Refresh to rebuild
the zone. To remove a column that is currently in the results area, click the trash can icon next to the column name in the
column configuration area and then click Refresh to rebuild the zone.

The following is an example of how the Column Configuration Area looks:

###### Multi-Query Zones

This type of zone combines individual Query Zones into a single query zone. A Search By dropdown, built from the zone
descriptions of the individual Query Zones, allows you to select the desired query to execute. Selecting a specific Query
Zone display the filters of that query in the filter area. At this point the zone simply executes the selected Query Zone, as if
it was executed on a standalone zone. By default, the first query zone option is selected.


-----

###### Map Zones

A map zone displays information related to one or more objects. For objects that are maintained using portal-based pages,
the standard display of the object is using a map zone. Map zones may be configured to display an explicit map or may
dynamically display the map based on the configuration of the record being displayed.

Because the information displayed in a map zone is configured using HTML, virtually any format supported by HTML is
possible. The following is an example of a typical map zone used to display information about an object.

A tool tip can be used to display additional help information for the details shown in a map zone. The tool tip may appear
adjacent to the section header or adjacent to individual elements on a map.

**NOTE:** You can customize the help icon or disable map help using the Custom Look and Feel feature configuration.

###### Open Map Maintenance Icon

Click the Go To Map icon to switch to the UI map maintenance page. On this page, you can view the HTML
configuration for the zone. Note that for map zones that display a business object configured without a map, the elements
displayed are automatically rendered. In this case, no icon is visible.

**NOTE:** **Debug mode only. This icon only appears when the system operates in Debug mode.**

###### Tabbed Display Zones

This type of zone combines individual map zones into a single zone, allowing for complex of information to be organized
and displayed in different tabs.

Tab labels are built from the zone descriptions of the individual zones and become the zone’s title. Selecting a specific tab
displays the information managed by the underlying zone. By default, the first tab is selected.


-----

###### Timeline Zone

A timeline zone is used to show events over time for multiple types of data. This type of zone is helpful for providing
a consolidated view of separate events occurring in time that may in fact impact each other. For example, in the billing
system, a timeline can show bills, payments and collection processes for the same time period.

The topics in this section describe the functionality available in timeline zones.

###### Timelines Zones Are Configured By Your Implementation Team

The product provides support for creating timeline zones. However, whether timeline zones are configured for your
implementation and on which portals they may be visible will depend on your specific configuration. Refer to Configuring
Timeline Zones for general information about configuring timeline zones. Refer to your specific edge application’s
documentation for details about what type of timeline information is provided out of the box.

###### You Can Move Through Time

You can click the controls at the top of a timeline zone to change the date-range of the zone's information. To reposition the
timeline to a specific date, selected the desired month and year at the top of the zone and click the search arrow.

Controls at the top right of the zone allow you to navigate through time.

- To go back one year, click the double-left arrow.

- To go back one month, click the single-left arrow.

- To go to today, click the middle dot.

- To go forward one month, click the single-right arrow.

- To go forward one year, click the double-right arrow.

###### Timelines Can Have Many Lines

Depending on how a timeline zone is configured, it will typically have one or more "lines" that show when significant
events have occurred. Each line represents a specific type of data. The data may be related to a specific maintenance object,
for example, payments may be displayed in one line and bills in another. It may also be possible to create multiple lines for
different types of records for the same maintenance object. For example, if your product provides an algorithm to display
cases, it may support defining a different entry for each case type.

###### Each Line Shows Events

Each line on a timeline may contain zero or more events where each event shows the date when the event occurs. For
example, the payment line in a timeline has a separate event for every payment received from the customer. Each line's
description contains the number of events on the line.

**CAUTION:**
If a line has more events than can fit onto a timeline, the line will show the first "chunk" of events and a message will
appear in the "more info area" explaining that some events have been truncated. If this happens and the truncated events
are in a later period, you can reposition the timeline's base period to show the truncated events.

###### Hovering Over An Event Shows the Event Information

When you hover over an event’s date icon, a pop-up widow appears showing details of the event. The following information
may appear:

- The event date.

- The event “hover text”. Typically the standard information string is shown for each event.


-----

- The event's common "information string" appears. This information is hypertext to allow for easy access to the
transaction on which the object is maintained.

- Additional information may appear. This is dependent on the particular timeline algorithm. Refer to each timeline
algorithm's description to find out if additional information appears in the pop-up area under any conditions.

- If the algorithm has configured BPA scripts that can be executed to perform business processes on the object, the BPA
script description appears prefixed with a "wizard's hat" icon.

###### Common Base Portals and Zones

The following sections describe common standards followed by the product for base query and maintenance dialogue.

###### All-In-One Portal

The all-in-one portal is used for low volume objects, where a small number of records are expected.

For example, many control tables use this style of portal. In this portal, rather than separate query and maintenance portals,
a single portal allows a user to find a record and maintain the record. A zone listing all existing records is displayed when
first entering the portal. A user can perform actions on existing records or add new records from there. More details about
the list zone are provided below.

Refer to Maintenance Portal for information about zones commonly found on maintenance portals.

The all-in-one portal will typically provide the ability to add a new record. This may be a button in the Page Action area or a
hyperlink defined directly on the list zone’s header area.

###### List Zone

This info zone appears when first entering the portal and displays a row for each record.

The following functions are commonly available in a list zone:

- A broadcast icon is included in each row. Clicking this icon opens other zones that contain more information about the
adjacent record.

- An Edit icon may be included in each row. Clicking this icon launches the maintenance BPA script to modify the
adjacent record.

- A Duplicate icon may be included in each row allowing the user to duplicate the adjacent record without having to first
display the record.

- A Delete icon may be included in each row allowing the user to delete the adjacent record without having to first display
the record.

- If the record has a simple BO lifecycle of Active and Inactive, the list zone may include a button to Activate or
**Deactivate the adjacent record.**

###### Separate Query and Maintenance Portals

For high volume objects where more sophisticated search criteria is needed to find a particular record, separate portals are
provided to search for the record and to maintain it.

The query portal contains a zone to search of the object that you wish to maintain. Additional information about the query
portal's search zone is provided below. Clicking an appropriate record in the search results navigates to the object's standalone maintenance portal.

The query portal will typically provide the ability to add a new record. This may be a button in the Page Action area or a
hyperlink defined directly on the list zone’s header area.


-----

###### Query Portal Search Zone

The query portal contains one zone used to search for the object.

The zone may be a standard query zone or may be a multi-query zone providing one or more ways to search for your record.

Once the search results are displayed, click on the hypertext for the desired record's information string to navigate to the
stand-alone maintenance portal.

###### Maintenance Portal

A maintenance portal refers to a page that is used to view and maintain a specific record. These types of records are
governed by a business object, which defines the user interface layout for both the display of the record and the add or
update of the record.

An all-in-one portal is a type of maintenance portal where the maintenance zone is displayed once a record has been
broadcast from the list zone. For the separate query and maintenance portal dialogue, the maintenance portal includes only
zones relevant for the specific record selected.

Maintenance portals may have multiple tabs to display information relevant for the object. Often, if the object has a Log, the
log is on a separate tab. (However, there may be some maintenance portals that include the log zone on the Main tab.)

The stand-alone maintenance portal is typically configured with the ability to navigate back to the query portal using either
a Search button in the Page Actions area or using a Go To Search hyperlink in the main zone's header area. The standalone maintenance portal may also include the ability to add a new record using an Add button in the Page Actions area. (If
not, a new record can be added by navigating through the menu or by navigating to the query portal where an Add hyperlink
may be found.)

The following sections describe zones that are common to portals used to maintain a record. Note that additional zones may
exist for specific all-in-one portals or stand-alone maintenance portals based on the particular functionality. Refer to the
documentation for each portal to understand the specific zones that are provided.

###### Object Display Zone

This is a zone that displays the object being maintained.

An object being displayed may or may not allow for actions or updates to be made. Typically there is a Record Actions
section in the display area that presents the valid actions. Depending on the functionality, the actions may prompt the users
to input values required for that action.

###### Log Zone

If the maintenance object for the record includes a status, it typically has a log that records important events in its lifecycle.

This log is shown in an info zone on the portal, either on the Main tab or on a separate Log tab. A link appears in the zone's
title bar to allow the user to add a new manual log entry.

###### Process Flow

This portal is used to guide a user through the steps needed to complete a process flow. If the process flow type is
configured to keep a record of a completed process flow then this portal may also be used to display the details of such
record.

Refer to Understanding Process Flows for more information.


-----

Each type of process flow is assumed to be configured with designated custom menu options that allows you to launch a
new process flow of that type as well as review saved off and completed records. When reviewing existing process flow
records, you are brought to a query portal with options for searching for a specific record. You may Resume a saved off but
not yet finalized process flow or review a complete one.

The Process Flow zone on the portal's Main tab page assists the user in completing the process flow as well as displays the
information captured on a completed process flow.

##### Fixed Pages

There are some pages in the system that are built using a fixed page metaphor. All user interfaces implemented in this way
function in a similar manner. This section describes functionality to these types of pages.

**NOTE:** Not all pages in the application use this metaphor. The preferred metaphor for pages in the system is to use
portal-based pages. For more information see Common Base Portals and Zones.

###### Maintenance Pages

Maintenance pages are used to maintain (add, change, etc.) the information in the system using a fixed page metaphor. This
section focuses on functionality common to all maintenance pages using this metaphor.

###### The Unique Identifier Area

Every object in the system must have a unique identifier. For some objects, typically administrative or control table data, the
unique identifier is defined by the user creating the record. Other objects, typically master or transaction entities, the unique
identifier is assigned by the system after the record is saved.

Where the identifier is displayed depends upon whether the ID is user-defined or system generated.

Pages displaying objects with a user defined identifier (such as To Do Type) typically display the identifier on the left along
with a search button. For master and transaction tables, (such as To Do Entry) the unique identifier is typically found in
the upper right corner of the screen along with a search button and is labeled as the entity’s ID. In this case, if there is an
information string associated with the object, it is displayed on the left.

If the object being maintained has an associated context menu, a Context Menu Button is displayed appear.

###### Confirmation & Error Messages

Whenever a database modification action is requested, the system first validates the data to be put on the database.

First, the system validates the information. If there are errors, the first error encountered is displayed in a window. In
addition to the error message, the error window also contains the error number and the identities of the programs that
detected the error. If you don't understand an error and you have to call product support, please supply them with this
information.

If there are no errors, the system is modified.

###### Warning If Unsaved Changes Exist

If you make any changes to an object and you don't commit these changes to the database, the following warning appears:
"You have unsaved changes that will be lost if you continue. Press OK to continue anyway."

If you want to commit the changes, click Cancel. You will then return to the page and can make further changes or press
Save. If you want to discard your changes and transfer to the new page, click OK.


-----

**CAUTION:** This warning is not displayed if you are working on a new object on a fixed page and you navigate to a
different page. Information about new objects is preserved in memory in anticipation of your return to the page. For
example, if you are in the middle of adding a new user and you want to quickly reference information on a different
page, you will not receive the above warning because your information will be saved. If you use the back button to
return to the user page, all of the information you were adding will be present and you can enter the rest of the new
user's data.

###### Query Pages

Query pages are used to display record sets in the system. Most query pages function in a similar manner. This section
focuses on functionality common to all of the system's query pages.

###### The Search Area

The upper right corner of the screen is almost always the identifier of the object associated with the search. In Oracle
Utilities Customer Care and Billing for example, the unique identifier on the Account Financial History page is the Account
ID.

To the right of the unique identifier is a Search button. This button is used to search for a different object than the one
whose data is being displayed in the page.

If the object being displayed has an associated context menu, a Context Menu Button is displayed.

##### User Preferences

The Preferences (or My Preferences) transaction and the User Maintenance transactions are the same except that with My
Preferences, only the following items can be modified:

- Main Tab

  - Language

  - Display Profile

  - Time Zone

  - Email Address

  - Dashboard Width

  - Dashboard Location

  - Dashboard State

  - Home Page

  - To Do Summary Age Bar Parameters

- Bookmarks

  - All information can be modified

- Portal Preferences

  - All information can be modified

- Favorite Links

  - All information can be modified

- Favorite Scripts

  - All information can be modified

###### User - Main

This page lets you view or define user information and access settings.

To open the page, use one of the following navigation options:

- The Admin > Security > User > Search menu item.

- The Menu > My Preferences menu item.

- The User Menu > Preferences menu item in the application toolbar.

Note that some fields are only modifiable when the page is opened from the from the Admin menu.

**Description of Page**

Basic user identification information is viewed or set in the First Name, Last Name, User ID, and Login ID fields, all of
which are modifiable only when the page is opened from the Admin menu. User and logon IDs must be unique. The Login
ID is the ID that the user uses to log in to the system. The User ID is the ID that is used throughout the application when
users are assigned to tasks or when the user ID is stamped on records when logging add or update actions.

**Language defines the language in which the user's screen prompts and messages appear.**

Set User Enable to allow the user to access the system.

**NOTE:** This field, available only when the page is accessed through the Admin menu, provides special field-level
security. A user can change the field only if the Enable/Disable access mode is set.

**Display Profile defines the display options for the user.**

The next group of fields is used to view or set user preferences. For example, you can set up portal preferences on a
"template user" and indicate that specified users will inherit their portal preferences from the template. Doing so provides
consistency in the application of account information and dashboard zones. This fields are modifiable only when the page is
accessed through the Admin menu.

- Set User Type to Template User if the user's preferences are to match those of other users.

- If a user's portal preferences are to be inherited from a "template user", use the Portals Profile User to define the user ID
of the template user. If applied, the specified user will inherit portal preferences from the Portals Profile User and will
be unable to customize those preferences.

- If a user's favorite links are to be inherited from a "template user", use the Favorites Profile User to define the user ID
of the template user. If applied, the specified user will inherit favorites preferences from the Favorites Profile User and
will be unable to customize those preferences.

The Time Zone associated with the user may be defined. Implementations may use this information for features and
functions where the user's time zone impacts display of data. Refer to Designing Time Zones for more information about the
use of time zones.

**Email Address captures the user's email address.**

**Dashboard Width defines the number of pixels to use for the user's dashboard area. A setting of 250 is recommended as a**
minimum. Depending on the width of a user's monitor, a higher setting (such as 250) will display more information without
compromising the space on the main area of the application. Setting the value to 0 will suppress the dashboard. The width
setting is updated in background to retain the value based on dynamic sizing.

**Dashboard Location governs whether the dashboard appears before or after the main page area. If no value is specified, the**
default position of the dashboard is after the main page area.

**Dashboard State indicates whether the dashboard is open or closed. The state is updated in background to retain the value**
based on dynamic opening or closing of the dashboard.


-----

**Home Page defines the page that appears when the user starts a session or clicks the Home link.**

The To Do entry fields control how To Do entries are aged in respect of the "age bars" that appear on To Do Summary, To
Do Supervisor Summary and the To Do Summary Dashboard Zone.

- Use Lower Age Limit for Yellow Bar to define the number of days old a To Do entry must be to be considered
"yellow" in the age bar. To Do entries below this limit are considered "green" in the age bar.

- Use Upper Age Limit for Yellow Bar is the high limit for the "yellow" bar. To Do entries older than this are considered
"red" in the age bar.

The User Group collection defines the group(s) with which the user is associated and the date (if any) when the user's
association expires. This feature is modifiable only when the page is accessed through the Admin menu. For more
information, see The Big Picture Of Application Security. Assignments of users in a user group can also be established or
maintained through the User Group - Users page.

**NOTE:** The ability to maintain the user groups on this page requires special field-level security. A user can change the
field only if the System Administration access mode is set.

If your implementation has configured Object Erasure for the User maintenance object, the Object Erasure Schedule
dashboard zone is visible displaying the erasure status for this user record, if applicable. Refer to Erasing User Information
by Obfuscation for more information on object erasure for User records.

###### User - To Do Roles

Open the User page and then navigate to the To Do Roles tab to define the To Do roles assigned to the user.

The information on this page cannot be modified if accessed through My Preferences.

**FASTPATH:** A user's To Do roles control the types of To Do entries the user can access. For additional information on
To Do roles, see To Do Entries Reference A Role.

**Description of Page**
The grid contains the user's To Do roles. To modify a To Do role linked to the user, simply move to a field and change its
value. To remove a To Do role, click the - (minus) button. To add a new To Do role, click the + (plus) button and enter the
role.

**Where Used**
Every To Do entry references a role. A To Do role has one or more users (and a user may belong to many To Do roles).
Users who are part of the To Do role assigned to a To Do entry may work on the To Do entry. For more information on this
feature, see The Big Picture Of To Do Lists.

###### User - Access Security

Open the User page and then navigate to the Access Security tab to define a user's security rights. You cannot modify this
page if you accessed it through My Preferences.

**FASTPATH:** Refer to The Big Picture of Application Security for more information about data access roles and access
groups.

**Description of Page**
Use the Default Access Group to define the access group that is defaulted on new records added by this user that are
subject to row security.


-----

The scroll area contains the Data Access Roles to which this user belongs. A user's data access roles play a part in
determining the accounts whose data they can access.

To add additional data access roles to this user, click the + button and specify the following:

Enter the Data Access Role. Keep in mind that when you add a Data Access Role to a User, you are granting this user
access to all of the accounts linked to the data access role's access groups.

Use Expiration Date to define when the user's membership in this data access role expires.

**NOTE:** You can also use Data Access Role - Main to maintain a data access role's users.

The tree highlights the Access Groups to which the above Data Access Roles provide access.

###### User - Bookmarks

This page is used to manage a user’s bookmarks that are created when a user clicks the Bookmark button and saves a
bookmark. From this page the user can delete a bookmark, change the name of the bookmark or change the sort sequence.

Open the User page and then navigate to the Bookmarks tab to modify or delete a bookmark.

**Description of Page**
**Sequence is the sort sequence associated with the bookmark. Bookmarks with the same sequence are then sorted**
alphabetically.

**Name is the user-defined name assigned to the bookmark. This is the text that is visible in the Bookmarks dashboard zone.**

**NOTE:** **Favorite Links vs. Bookmarks. Favorite links are configured through the user page and define pages that a**
user can navigate to. They do not define context (although some pages may use information currently in global context
when navigating). Some users may not be allowed to configure their own favorite links and would see the favorite
links associated with a profile user. Bookmarks are created using a bookmark button available on each page. The
bookmark saves navigation information, context information and also captures some information about the state of a
page. Bookmarks are not governed by any user profile configuration.

###### User - Portal Preferences

The base product contains several portals that allow users to customize them via portal preferences. Portal preferences allow
users to control:

- Which zones appear on the portal

- The order in which the zones appear

- Whether the zones should be "collapsed" (i.e., minimized) when the portal opens.

**NOTE:** **You may not be able to change your portal preferences. If a note appears immediately before the list of**
portals, a system administrator has configured your user ID to reference a Portals Profile User (this is defined on the
**Main tab). Preferences set in this way cannot be modified. System administrators do this in order to enforce a common**
look-and-feel throughout the user community.

Open the User page and then navigate to the Portal Preferences tab to modify a user’s preferences.

**Description of Page**

The accordion contains a row for every portal configured to show on user preferences and to which you have access. To
change how a portal's zones appear, expand the respective row and change the elements accordingly. The remainder of this
section describes how you can configure how a portal's zones appear.


-----

**Zone lists all of the zones in the portal.**

Place a check under Display if the zone should be displayed on the portal.

Place a check under Initially Collapsed if the zone should be minimized when the portal is initially opened. Setting zones
as initially collapsed is a good idea to save space and to help pages to load more quickly. Refer to Zones May Appear
Collapsed When A Page Opens for more information.

**CAUTION:** Recommendation. It is recommended that you set your preferences to collapse zones that you don't use
often. This is because the system doesn't perform the processing necessary to build collapsed zones until you ask to
expand a zone. Opening a page with zones collapsed accelerates the response times of portal.

Use Sequence to control the position of the zone in respect of the other zones. This field is disabled if Display is not
checked. Duplicate Sequence numbers are allowed.

For zones displaying data that is changing often, use Refresh Seconds to define in seconds how often the zone is refreshed.
The minimum valid value is 15. The maximum valid value is 3600 (1 hour). A value of 0 indicates no automatic refresh.

**Security Access indicates whether the user has access rights to a zone. Refer to Granting Access To Zones for more**
information.

###### User - Favorite Links

This page is used to define a user's favorite transactions and URLs. Each such link appears as an entry in the Favorite Links
Zone in the Dashboard area.

**NOTE:** **A hot key can be used to execute a favorite link. Rather than clicking a button in the favorite links zone, you**
can invoke your first nine favorite links by pressing Ctrl + a number (where the number corresponds with the relative
position of the transaction in your list of favorites). Note that the numeric keypad on your keyboard cannot be used to
implement this function.

Open the User page and then navigate to the Favorite Links tab to modify a user’s favorite links.

**Description of Page**

**NOTE:** **You may not be able to change your favorite links. If a Note appears beneath your User ID, your user id has**
been setup to reference a specific Favorites Profile User as defined on the Main tab. If a system administrator has setup
your user ID in this way, your preferences may not be changed. System administrators may apply this feature in order to
enforce a common look-and-feel throughout the user community.

Each row references a Navigation Option. The navigation options supplied with the base package correspond with the
system's menu items. This means you can setup a favorite link to open any transaction in the system (in either add or
**update mode).**

**NOTE:** **Favorite links can point to other places. The navigation options supplied with the base package always**
open a transaction's Main tab. If you find yourself continually accessing a different tab page, you can have your
implementation team create a new navigation option that references the desired tab page. Once this navigation option is
set up, you can reference it as one of your favorite links. In addition, it's also possible for your implementation team to
setup navigation options that open a URL outside of the system. For example, your implementation team could setup a
navigation option to a credit rating company's website. Once this navigation option is set up, you can reference it as one
of your favorite links.

Use a Sequence to control the order in which the navigation option appears in the Favorite Links Zone.

**Security Access indicates if you have been given security rights to the respective transaction. Refer to The Big Picture Of**
Application Security for more information.


-----

**NOTE:** **Favorite Links vs. Bookmarks. Favorite links are configured through the user page and define pages that a**
user can navigate to. They do not define context (although some pages may use information currently in global context
when navigating). Some users may not be allowed to configure their own favorite links and would see the favorite
links associated with a profile user. Bookmarks are created using a bookmark button available on each page. The
bookmark saves navigation information, context information and also captures some information about the state of a
page. Bookmarks are not governed by any user profile configuration.

###### User - Favorite Scripts

This page is used to define a user's favorite scripts. Each script is displayed in the Favorite Scripts zone on the Dashboard
portal where it can be used to initiate a script.

**NOTE:** **A hot key can be used to execute a favorite script. Rather than selecting a script from the business process**
assistant, you can invoke your first nine favorite scripts by pressing Ctrl + Shift + a number (where the number
corresponds with the relative position of the script in your list of favorites). Note that the numeric keypad on your
keyboard cannot be used to implement this function.

Open the User page and then navigate to the Favorite Scripts tab to modify a user’s Favorite Scripts.

**Description of Page**

**NOTE:** **You may not be able to change your favorite scripts. If a Note is displayed on top of the grid, your user id**
has been setup to reference a specific Favorites Profile User as defined on the Main tab. If a system administrator has
setup your user ID in this way, your preferences may not be changed. System administrators may apply this feature in
order to enforce a common look-and-feel throughout the user community.

Each row in the grid contains one of your favorite Scripts.

Use the Sort Sequence to control the order in which the scripts appear in the business process assistant menu.

**Security Access indicates whether you have access to the script's application service. Refer to The Big Picture Of**
Application Security for more information.

###### User - Characteristics

Select Admin > Security > User > Search and navigate to the Characteristics tab to define characteristic values for the
user. You cannot modify this page if you accessed it through My Preferences.

**Description of Page**

Use the characteristics grid to capture additional information about the user.

You can only choose Characteristic Types defined as permissible for the user record. Refer to Setting Up Characteristic
Types & Their Values for more information.

Enter a valid Characteristic Value for the selected characteristic type. You may enter more than one characteristic row for
the same characteristic type, each associated with a unique Sequence number. If not specified, the system defaults it to the
next sequence number for the characteristic type.

###### User - Miscellaneous

Select Admin > Security > User > Search and navigate to the Miscellaneous tab to view additional information
associated with a user.


-----

User Id, First Name and Last Name are displayed. Depending on your implementation, additional zones may appear on the
User Portal

If additional zones appear, use the embedded help for information about the fields managed on the zone.

##### Initiating Scripts

Your implementation team can set up business process assistant (BPA) scripts to walk you through business processes.
Once scripts have been set up, you can initiate a script using any of the following methods:

- You can define a list of your "favorite scripts" on your user preferences. You can then invoke any of the scripts from the
Favorite Scripts zone on the dashboard portal. You can also invoke any of your first 9 favorites by pressing Ctrl +
```
 Shift + a number (where the number corresponds with the relative position of the script in your list of favorites). For

```
example, if you press Ctrl+Shift+2 and you've setup your "favorite scripts" to be Start Autopay and Stop sending
**marketing information; the Stop receiving marketing information script is invoked. Note that the numeric keypad on**
your keyboard cannot be used to implement this function.

- You can configure a menu item to launch a script by referencing a navigation option that is a script navigation option
type.

- The system creates To Do entries to highlight tasks that require attention (e.g., bills in errors, accounts without bill
cycles, etc.). Users can complete many of these tasks without assistance. However, you can set up the system to
automatically launch a script when a user selects a To Do entry. For example, consider a To Do entry that highlights a
bill that's in error due to an invalid mailing address. You can set up the system to execute a script when this To Do entry
is selected. This script might prompt the user to first correct the customer's default mailing address and then re-complete
the bill. Refer to Executing A Script When A To Do Is Launched for more information.

- You can indicate that a script should be launched upon entering the system. This functionality enables an external
system to launch the system and immediately launch a script.

- The following hot keys cause an interactive menu is displayed:

  - `Ctrl+Alt+Q`

  - `Ctrl+Shift+S`

The menu allows you to search for a script using any word in its description. Note, if you've turned on Search only Eligible
**Scripts, your search is limited to eligible scripts. Note, the system displays an indication if each script in the grid is**
**Eligible or Ineligible in this section.**

You can initiate a script from this area by clicking on it.

When a script is initiated, this menu closes and the object display area shifts down to make room for the script area.


-----

**NOTE:** **Securing scripts. Only scripts the user is allowed to execute are displayed. Refer to Securing Script Execution**
for more information.

**NOTE:** **Customize the script area. Using the Height step type, an individual script may be configured to use more**
or less of the script area than the standard script area. It is also possible to configure a script to hide the script area
altogether.

The information in the script area takes you through the steps in the selected business process (note, your implementation
team controls the information that appears in the script area).

The following points highlight useful information common to all scripts:

- **Return focus to script area. Often during a script the focus moves from the script area to another section of the page.**
For example, you might be required to fill in data for a new record being added. When you are ready to return to the
script area, rather than using the mouse to return to the area, you can press Ctrl+Shift+F. The focus returns you to
either the first available input field or to a "default" button if no input field is available.

- **The Continue button. Many steps in a script ask you to click the Continue button when you're ready to restart a script.**
For example, a step may ask you to confirm a customer's automatic payment information and then click Continue when
you're ready for the script to restart. Rather than using the mouse to click this button, you can press Ctrl+Shift+C.

- **Selected button changes color. When you click a button in the script area, the button selected changes color so that you**
can easily see which option you selected.

**FASTPATH:** Refer to The Big Picture Of Scripts for more information about scripts.

**NOTE:** You can abort a script at any time by clicking the red X button in the upper right corner of the script area (or by
pressing Ctrl+Shift+X).

##### Shortcut Key Summary

The following table summarizes the keyboard shortcuts (hot keys) available in the system:

**NOTE:** It is possible that your specific product supports additional shortcut keys. Refer to your product documentation
for more information.

**NOTE:** It is possible that some of the following system accelerator keys may duplicate shortcuts, or hot keys, that are
predefined within your browser. If this is the case, the browser's functionality commonly takes precedence.

**NOTE:** It is possible that your implementation uses one of the accelerator keys listed below for a different purpose.
For example, in some languages, a shortcut key may be used for a special character in the alphabet not included on all
keyboards. It is possible to turn off any of the Alt+letter shortcuts and Ctrl+Alt+letter shortcuts listed below using a
properties file entry. The property is ouaf.shortcut.ignore.altKeys= where one or more letters may be entered separated
by a comma. When setting this property, the system automatically enables a 'potential alternate key' for certain functions
(see the table below). Refer to the Server Administration Guide for more information about the property.

#### Customer Information

We use the term customer information to reference the demographic, geographic, and financial objects that form the core
of your CIS system. In this section, we describe how to maintain these objects.

##### Understanding The V

The "V" is the shape of a diagram we use to illustrate the objects that form the core of the system: Person, Account,
**Premise, Service Agreement, and Service Point. These objects hold demographic, geographic, and financial information**


-----

about your company's customers and properties. The following diagram illustrates the objects in the "V", as well as
important objects related to the "V" objects (bill, payment, meter, field activity, meter read).

You must intuitively understand the concepts embodied in the "V" before you can perform the business processes in the
system. In this section, we provide an overview of these objects. In later sections, we describe how you maintain this
information.

###### Persons

A person exists for every individual or business with which your company has contact. Besides customers, persons exist for
landlords, contractors, accountants at corporate customers, third party guarantors, energy distributors, collection agencies,
etc.

On a person is maintained demographic information like Name, Mailing Address, Phone Numbers, Email Address, and Life
Support Details.

Most persons are linked to at least one account because, without an account, the person cannot receive a bill. There are rare
examples of persons without accounts; for example, collection agencies that don't receive bills, and parent companies that
receive statements (as opposed to bills).

**FASTPATH:**
Refer to Maintaining Persons for more information about persons.

###### Accounts

Accounts are the entities for which bills are created. You must create at least one account for every customer. The account
contains information that controls when bills are created and how they are formatted.

Every account must reference at least one person because the person contains the customer's demographic information (e.g.,
names, phone numbers, forms of ID). We refer to this individual as the "main" person linked to the account. In addition to
the "main" person, an account may reference other types of persons, e.g., the billing contact, the third party guarantor of the
account's debt, persons who receive copies of bills, etc.


-----

Most accounts are linked to at least one service agreement because, without a service agreement, there is nothing on which
a bill can be based. An account without a service agreement may exist; you just won't be able to do much in the system with
such an account.

**FASTPATH:**
Refer to Maintaining Accounts for more information about accounts.

###### Service Agreements (SAs)

Think of a service agreement as a contract between your company and a customer. The service agreement contains the
terms and conditions controlling how the system calculates charges for the specific service supplied to the customer.

Every account should have at least one service agreement (otherwise, the account has no financial obligations with
your company). There is no limit to the number of service agreements that may be linked to an account. However, most
residential customers have X service agreements where X is the number of services sold by your company. For example, if
your company sells both electricity and gas, most accounts will have two service agreements.

A separate service agreement is required for every service supplied to every account. Why? Because a variety of fields may
differ for each service agreement:

- Obviously, the price of the service is different.

- The credit and collection criteria may be different.

- The general ledger account to which the resultant revenue and/or receivable are linked is different.

- The sales tax could be different for each good / service / location.

- The service point measuring consumption will frequently be different.

- The list goes on...

Service agreements that bill for premise-based services are linked to one or more premises via their service points. When
you link a service point to a service agreement, you are telling the system that the service agreement's account will pay for
the service point's service.

**FASTPATH:**
Refer to Maintaining Service Agreements for more information.

###### Premises

A premise is created for every location to which your company supplies service. On a premise is maintained geographic
information like:

- The address.

- Characteristics that determine tax jurisdictions.

- Descriptions of unusual situations associated with a property.

- The list goes on...

Most premises have at least one service point because, without a service point, there are no services supplied to the premise.
A premise without service points may exist; you just won't be able to do much in the system with such a premise.

**FASTPATH:**


-----

Refer to Maintaining Premises for more information about premises.

###### Service Points (SPs)

Think of a service point as a specific location at a premise where your company supplies service. A service point contains
information describing the type of service and how it is measured.

A premise should have at least one service point (otherwise, there are no services supplied to the premise). However, it is
permissible for a new premise to exist without service points until you are ready to physically start service at the premise.

A premise may have many service points. However, most residential premises have X service points where X is the number
of services sold by your company. For example, if your company sells both electricity and gas, most of your premises will
have two service points.

Separate service points are required for every service supplied to a premise. Why? Because a variety of fields may differ for
each service point:

- Basic information about the Service Point, including time zone, market, parent Service Point (if applicable), and status.

- Information related to field work that is performed at the current Service Point, including applicable warnings or
instructions.

- The measurement cycle, route, and route sequence for the Service Point.

- Basic characteristics about the service; for example, pipe size, take point, and amperes.

When you link a service point to a service agreement, you are telling the system that the service agreement's account will
pay for the service point's service.

The following topics describe the relationship between a service point and the physical devices that may be installed at the
service point.

###### Metered versus Item-Based versus Non-Badged Service Points

There are three major categories of service points:

- Those where consumption is measured (e.g., electricity, gas, water) by a meter. We refer to these types of service points
as metered. A metered service point may have zero or one meter installed at any instant in time. Over time, a metered
service point may have many meters installed and removed.

- Those where consumption is not measured, but where there exists some type of badged (i.e., uniquely identified) item
that impacts billing and dispatching (e.g., streetlights, a security camera). We refer to these types of service points as
**item-based. An item-based service point may have zero or one badged item installed at any instant in time. Over time, an**
item-based service point may have many badged items installed and removed.

- Those where one or more non-badged items (i.e., items without a unique identity) that have some impact on billing
or dispatching exist. We refer to these types of service points as unbadged. At a single instant in time, a non-badged
service point may have many unbadged items installed at it. Refer to Service Points With Multiple Items for an
illustration of such a service point.

**NOTE:**
**Multiple unbadged items can also be defined on metered and item-based service points. Under some billing**
scenarios, you may define non-badged items on a metered or item-based service point. For example, assume you have
an item-based service point that exists to support lamp service. Also assume that the rate for lamp service is based on
the type of lamp and the number of feet of electric wire between the pole and the power source. To define the number


-----

of feet of wire, you could create a non-badged item type called WIREFEET and indicate the number of feet on the
item-based service point. On this service point, you can also keep track of the specific lamp that's installed.

###### Service Points With Multiple Items

An example will help explain a single service point with multiple non-badged items. Assume you have a parking lot with 4
lights, none of which are badged.

You can set up the above example with one premise with a single non-badged service point. On the service point, you create
one item for each type of item in the parking lot:

- 20K lumen lamp

- 10K lumen lamp

- pole

For each type of item, you indicate the quantity that exist in the parking lot:

- 20K lumen lamp - 2

- 10K lumen lamp - 2

- pole - 4

###### Putting It All Together


-----

To help you understand the significance of the "V", consider a few scenarios:

- When a new residential customer starts service, you create both person and account objects for the new customer. In
addition, you also create service agreements and link them to the appropriate service points. You won't have to create a
new premise and service points because the customer is probably moving into an existing house.

- If the residential customer moves within your service territory, you don't have to set up new person or account objects.
You also don't have to set up new premise and service point objects if the customer is moving into an existing house.
You only have to create new service agreements and link them to the appropriate service points (and the system does
most of the service agreement set up processes for you).

- A business with a single location uses the same "V" objects as does a residential customer. If the business expands and
starts using services at other locations, you simply link new service agreements to the existing account. You don't have to
redefine person or account information.

**NOTE:**
**Bottom line. A person and an account are needed for every customer. After these exist, future service requests simply**
involve stopping existing service agreements and starting new ones. You typically won't have to add or modify premise
or service point information unless new locations are built.

**FASTPATH:**
For more information, refer to Maintaining The "V", Navigating The "V" Using Control Central, The Big Picture Of
Starting Service, and The Big Picture Of Stopping Service.

###### Sample V For A Residential Customer

The following illustration shows a simple residential customer's "V" objects.

###### Sample V For A Commercial Customer With Multiple Premises

The following illustration shows the "V" objects for a commercial customer who pays for service at two premises.


-----

**NOTE:**
The above example shows a separate service agreement per premise. If your rates allow, you could link both premises to
a single service agreement.

###### How To Set Up Customer Hierarchies

Consider the following customer hierarchy:

The above hierarchy shows a parent company (Michelin Inc) with two subsidiaries. Each subsidiary, in turn, could have
their subsidiaries, and these subsidiaries can have their own subsidiaries ...

You must set up a person for every individual and business in a hierarchy. After the basic demographic information is
defined, you define each person's children using the Person to Person page.

**NOTE:**
**A script can be used to set up a hierarchy. The demonstration database contains a script that guides users through the**
process of setting up a hierarchy. Please speak to your implementation staff if you'd like to import this script for use in
your implementation.

After a hierarchy is set up, the system displays its members in the Person Tree Zone (this is a zone on the Customer
Information Portal). In addition, if the persons in a hierarchy have accounts, summary information about these accounts is
displayed in the Account Summary Zone.


-----

While hierarchies would typically be set up to define parent companies and subsidiaries, you can use this functionality for
many other purposes. For example, a customer relationship manager could set up a hierarchy containing their "important"
customers. To do this, they'd need to create a "dummy" person for the parent and then link the "important" customers to it.
After this hierarchy is set up, the manager could see a summary of these customers in the Account Summary Zone whenever
they display the "dummy" person.

##### Navigating The V

The product provides two options for Navigating the V:

- Control Central

- Customer 360

**Control Central is the name given to the functionality that helps you:**

- Find a person.

- Find an account.

- Find a premise.

- View information about a person / account / premise.

- View alerts and messages about a person / account / premise.

- Navigate to pages that contain information related to a person / account / premise.

**Customer 360 is an updated and more configurable alternative to Control Central. The Customer 360 functionality works**
in conjunction with Unified Search, which provides for a more sophisticated, single-box search for customers or premises.
Once Unified Search has populated a customer and/or premise, you are brought to the Customer 360 portal to see an
overview of the customer.

**FASTPATH:**
For more information about the relationships between persons, accounts, and premises, see Understanding The "V".

###### Control Central

The following sections describe Control Central features.

###### Control Central - Search

Open Menu > Control Central Search to find a customer and/or a premise.

**Keyboard Shortcut** **Alternate Shortcut**
```
Alt+L Alt+Shift+L

```
**NOTE:** Refer to Shortcut Key Summary for information about the alternate shortcut.

**NOTE:** **Automatic transfer to Control Central — Account Information. You are automatically transferred to**
Control Central - Account Information when an account / premise is selected on this page.

The contents of this section describe how to use control central search.


-----

###### Search Facilities

Control Central allows users to search for a person, account and/or premise using a variety of search criteria.

The following search options are provided in the base product:

- **Name and Address: searches for an accounts, person and / or premise using a person’s name and / or a service address.**

- **Account ID: searches for an account using an Account ID.**

- **Person Contact: searches for accounts / persons using a person contact.**

- **Phone Number: searches for accounts / persons using a phone number.**

- **Person ID Type/Value: searches for accounts / persons using a person identifier.**

- **Geo Type/Value: searches for a premise using the geographic identifier of the premise or of one if its service points.**

Refer to each search option’s zone help for details on the search criteria.

From the search results lists, you can select a record to navigate to Control Central - Account Information, where
information about the customer is displayed. You can also navigate to other pages in Control Central to view more
information about the account, person and / or premise.

**NOTE:**
**Automatic transfer to Account Information tab. If your search criteria result in a single customer being retrieved, you**
are automatically transferred to Control Central - Account Information with that customer's information displayed.

###### Meter Search

Control Central does not provide an option to search using a meter ID. If you know the meter’s identifier, transfer to 360
Search by Device and search for the meter. Use the hyperlinks to navigate to 360 Degree Views, to see more details about
the meter and its related measuring component(s) and service point.

###### Item Search

Control Central does not provide an option to search using an item ID. If you know the item’s identifier, transfer to 360
Search by Device and search for the item. Use the hyperlinks to navigate to 360 Degree Views, to see more details about the
item and its related service point.

###### Search Options

The CIS Division filter can be specified to limit the search to accounts or premises in a particular CIS Division. The
matching is done on either the account’s CIS Division or the premise’s CIS Division depending on whether the search is
account-oriented or premise-oriented:

- If searching by only a name, the search results that have an associated account will be matched on the account’s CIS
Division.

- If searching by a name and any of the address constituents, the search results that have an associated account will be
matched on the account’s CIS Division.

- If searching by only the address constituents, the search results will be matched on the premise’s CIS Division,
regardless of whether or not the premise is linked to an account.


-----

The Show All Premises search option controls whether you see all of an account's premises in the search results. If turned
on, every premise linked to an account is shown in the search results. If turned off, only one premise is shown per account
(and this premise is selected at random).

This switch pertains to the following search methods:

- Search by name only (i.e., all address constituents are left blank)

- Search by account ID

- Search by person phone number

- Search by person identifier

This switch does NOT pertain to the following search methods as these are premise-oriented, not account-oriented:

- Search by name when any address constituent is entered

- Search by address constituents only (i.e., name is blank)

- Search by geographic identifier

The benefit of turning this switch off is that an account will be immediately selected when you enter unique accountoriented search criteria. For example, if you specify an Account ID and press enter, the system automatically selects the
account; you don't have to wait for the search results to be populated with the multitude of premises linked to the account
(and then select one of the rows). Please note, an alert highlights if the selected account has other premises.

**NOTE:**
**Default. The first time you open this page, CIS Division and Show All Premises are defaulted from your user**
preferences. When you return to this page, the last values are defaulted.

The Expand Results search option is available if your implementation has enabled expanded / fuzzy searching. (Refer to
Advanced Search Options for more information.) This functionality relies on special indexes configured in the database, to
attempt to include similar words or alternate spellings of a supplied search value. This expanded searching is applied only to
searches by name and / or address constituents.

###### Wild Cards

The control central searches against Name, Address, and City support wild cards. The wild card character is % and
represents any number or character. The system always appends a % for you when you use these search methods. Examples
will help clarify this functionality:

- If you enter a B, the system searches for B% (and will find all objects that begin with B ).

- If you enter B%N, the system searches for B%N%. It will find anything that

  - Starts with a B, and

  - has zero or more other characters followed by an N.

- If you enter %B the system searches for %B%. It will find anything with a B in it, no matter what it starts and ends with.

**NOTE:**
**Certain wildcard searches can result in lengthy response times. If you use the wildcard character to prefix your**
search criteria (e.g., %San Fran), lengthy response times can result. Why? Because the system will have to look at
EVERY customer in the system before it can return the results.


-----

###### Search Results

The search results at the bottom of the page contain persons, accounts, and premises that match your search criteria. The
information displayed in this area differs depending on the type of search you perform. You can perform searches on a
customer's name, address, phone number, person contact, person identifier and geographic value.

The information strings that display in the Person/Account and Premise columns vary depending on what context
information is present:

- For a person that is not linked to an account, the Person/Account information string will include the text ‘No Account
Information’ and the Premise column will be blank.

- For an account that does not have a service agreement, the Person/Account information string will include the text ‘No
Service Agreement’ and the Premise column will be blank.

- For an account with a service agreement that is not currently linked to a service point, the Premise column will display
‘No Premise Information’.

- For a premise that is not linked to an account, the Person/Account column will display ‘No Person Information’.

**NOTE:**
**The first 300 matches are retrieved and displayed. The base search zones are configured with the Number of Rows**
_to Display and Number of Rows to Retrieve for SQL parameters set to 300. If you do not find the account / person /_
premise you are looking for in the set of results, refine your search criteria. A Control Central Search Factor feature
configuration option (in the General System Configuration feature type) controls the maximum number of indexed
results that will be evaluated by name and/or address before filtering is done. For instance, if the search factor is set to
3000 and a search is for 'Smith%' on '%Main St', the search will get the first 3000 'Smith%' from the name index and
the first 3000 '%Main St' from the address 1 index. Then it will filter out non-matching combinations. Regardless of the
resulting set, the search will not return more than the Number of Rows to Retrieve for SQL, which is set to 300. The
search factor can be set to any number from 301 to 50000. Note that the higher the factor used, the more possibility of
affecting performance. If this option is not specified, the default is 3000.

**Automatic selection if only one match. You don't have to select a record if there is one and only one object that**
matches your search criteria. The system automatically selects it and transfers you to Control Central - Account
Information.

**Use Tab and Enter to select an account / person / premise. You don't have to use the mouse to select a record when**
multiple matches are returned. The system highlights the first row in the search results. If this is the account / person /
premise you are looking for, press Enter to select it. If not, press Tab until you've highlighted the desired record and
then press Enter to select it.

**Use the Work List dashboard zone to navigate to any account / person in the search results. When you select a**
record from the search results, you are automatically transferred to Control Central - Account Information. If you want
to look at a different account that appeared in the search results, you do not have to return to the Main tab. You can use
the Work List dashboard zone to load another account without leaving the Control Central - Account Information page.
To build the work list, run the search and click on the Work List button that appears in the Person /Account column
heading. This will copy over the contents of the Person/Account column into the Work List zone in the dashboard.
Refer to Work Lists for more information.

###### Alert Zone

The Alert Zone is a grid that contains messages highlighting a variety of situations. Clicking on the hyperlink transfers you
to an appropriate page.


-----

**Account alerts are implementation-specific. On Account - Alerts, a user can define account-specific alerts that should be**
displayed whenever the account is selected. The Alert Types control table contains the possible alert messages.

**Alerts are produce from one of two sources.**

- Alerts are primarily produced by plugging in alert algorithms on the installation record. The alerts are shown based
on the configured sequence on the installation record. Refer to Count Customer Contacts of a Given Type (CC-NBRVALID) and Count Pay Plans with a Given Status (PP BY STATUS) for examples of such algorithms.

- Alerts can also be created by system-generated alerts, which are also referred to as legacy alerts. To enable the systemgenerated alerts, set the Use Legacy Alerts Option Type on the General System Configuration Feature Configuration to
Y. When this feature is enabled, the system-generated alerts are executed before the plug-in alert algorithms.

**NOTE:**
A plug-in version for each of the system-generated alerts is provided with the product in addition to many without
a system-generated equivalent. If the legacy alert feature is enabled, you would not use the equivalent plug-in alert
algorithm, otherwise, these alerts may appear twice on the Alert Zone.

You can introduce your own alert algorithms to highlight additional alert conditions based on your business rules.

The table below lists the system-generated alerts that may appear if the use legacy alert feature is enabled and the page to
which you will be transferred if you click on the hyperlink. The table below lists alerts in alphabetical order, but it includes
a column indicating the order in which the alert will appear.

###### Bill Graph Zone

The Bill Graph Zone illustrates the ending balance and new charges on each of the customer's historical bills.

**NOTE:**
**Approximately a year and half is shown. This zone shows all bills within 20 months of the latest bill. This limitation**
exists to prevent this zone from becoming unmanageably wide.

For balance-forward accounts, both ending balances and current charges are shown in the graph. For open-item accounts,
only the current charges are shown in the graph.

The following points describe unique features of this zone:

- If you hover the mouse over a bar in the graph, summary information about the bill will display.

- If you click on a bar in the graph, you will be transferred to the bill page with the respective bill displayed.

###### Billed Consumption Zone

The Billed Consumption Zone illustrates the amount of consumption on each of the customer's historical bills. Up to three
units of measure (UOM) are shown for each bill. The system uses the graph UOM's defined on the SA types associated with
the customer's active service agreements. If more than three graph UOM's are detected for a customer, the system uses those
associated with the service agreement types with the highest bill print priorities.

The following points describe unique features of this zone:

- If you hover the mouse on a bar in the graph, summary information about the bill will display.

- If you click on a bar in the graph, you will be transferred to the bill page with the respective bill displayed.

**NOTE:**
**Approximately a year and half is shown. This zone shows all bills within 20 months of the latest bill. This limitation**
exists to prevent this zone from becoming unmanageably wide.

###### Current Customer Zone

The Current Customer Zone contains basic information about the Person / Account / Premise on which you are working.

**Person This part of the context area contains the person's standard information. Note, this information is formatted by a**
plug-in algorithm on the installation record. Refer to the base package's person information algorithm (PERS-INFO) for an
example. If you prefer different formatting logic, your system administrator should configure the system appropriately

**Account ID This part of the context area contains the unique identifier of the account and the name of its main customer.**

Adjacent to the account ID appears a "check digit". This is for information purposes only and is not needed to operate the
system. Refer to the Description of Page section under Account - Main for a description of how "check digit" is calculated.


-----

**Premise This part of the context area contains the premise address. The address information is formatted by a plug-in**
algorithm on the installation record. Refer to the base package's premise format algorithm (PREM-INFO) for an example.
If you prefer a different format, your system administrator should configure the system appropriately

Below Premise, the account's Current Balance and Payoff Balance are displayed. Payoff Balance will be hidden when
it's the same as the Current Balance. Refer to Current Amount versus Payoff Amount for more information.

**Aged Debt Bar If the account's Current Balance is greater than zero, a colored bar is displayed adjacent. This bar provides**
information about the age of the account's debt.

The number of segments that appear in this bar is dependent on the elements of the customer's aged balance. The following
segments may appear:

- disputed debt (If you handle disputed debt as described in Disputing Items),

- new charges and debt between 0 and X days old (where X is the account's customer class's bill due days),

- debt between X to 30 days old,

- debt between 31 to 60 days old,

- debt older than 60 days

**NOTE:**
If you hover the mouse pointer over a segment of the bar, the respective amount of debt will appear. If you click on the
arrears bar you will be taken to the Account Financial History page. Note that information about debt balances by age is
not applicable to open-item accounts.

**Start Service Push this button if you want to start service for the account and the service isn't at a premise (e.g., a deposit).**
Refer to The Big Picture Of Starting Service for more information.

**Stop Service Push this button if you want to stop service for the account at the premise. Refer to The Big Picture of**
Stopping Service for more information.

###### Credit and Collections Info Zone

The Credit and Collections Info Zone is a grid that contains a variety of credit & collections-oriented events. Pushing the
button adjacent to the information transfers you to an appropriate page. The following table lists the type of information that

###### How To Add A New Customer From Control Central

There are three ways to add a new customer from control central:

- You can add a new customer by invoking the Person and Account pages from the Menu dropdown. This is not the
recommended approach, as it requires several screen interactions; either of the following approaches is preferable.


-----

- If your team has set up sales and marketing campaigns, you can use the order transaction to add a new customer. Refer to
Order User Interface Flow for more information. Refer to Sales & Marketing for background information about sales and
marketing campaigns.

- Adding a Person from Control Central. You navigate as follows:

  - You start from Control Central - Search. On this page, you determine if the customer already has an account. If so,
select it and you're done. If not, proceed to the next step.

  - Click the + button adjacent to the Name field to transfer to Person - Main Information page (with the name you
entered already defaulted). Use the Person pages to record all relevant information about the new customer.

  - Enter the customer's names, phone numbers, and IDs. Click Save (or press ALT+S) to add the person and account.
The value of Add Account and Start Service is defaulted to "on" and the Customer Class defaults based on the
**Person Type. This means that when you click save the following will happen: a new person is added, a new account**
is added, the new person is linked to the new account, and you will be automatically transferred to Start/Stop where
you can start service. (Note: This is the default behavior of the system. However, an implementation can define
different functionality by setting up a customer information options feature configuration.

**NOTE:**
**Default. When the system links the person to the account, it defaults the relationship type from the installation options.**
A different relationship type can be defined for persons versus businesses on the installation record.

If you need to tinker with information on the account, transfer to account maintenance (use the context menu) and make any
necessary changes.

##### Maintaining The V

As described in Understanding The "V", the "V" objects are those that form the core of your business processes. In this
section, we describe the pages that maintain these objects.

**NOTE:**
**Start/Stop Also Maintains The "V". The Start/Stop Pages also maintain many of the objects in the "V". For example,**
service agreements are created behind-the-scenes when you start service for a customer. This means you won't have to
use most of the pages described in this section as part of your day-to-day activities. Rather, they exist in case you need
to override what the system automatically set up for you.

###### Maintaining Persons

On the person page, you define demographic information about your customers and every other individual or business with
which your company has contact. The topics in this section describe the person page.

###### Person - Main Information

The Main page contains core person information like names, telephone numbers, and forms of identification. Open this page
using Menu > Customer Information > Person > Search.

**Description of Page**

**Person Information contains basic information about the person. These values only appear after the person exists in the**
database. The ID is a system-assigned random number that stays with a person for the life of the system.


-----

**NOTE:**
**Formatting is performed by a plug-in. The format of Person Information is controlled by a plug-in algorithm on the**
installation record. Refer to the base package's person information algorithm (PERS-INFO) for an example. If you prefer
different formatting logic, your system administrator should configure the system appropriately.

The following information may be recorded about a person:

**Person/Business indicates if the entity is a person or a business. Valid values are: Person, Business. This value controls**
how the person's primary name is validated.

**Life Support / Sensitive Load indicates if the person has life support or sensitive load equipment. Valid values are: LS/SL**
(i.e., the person has life support / sensitive load equipment), None. If the customer has LS/SL equipment, make a note of the
type of equipment in the Life Support / Sensitive Load Notes.

**A premise can also have life support / sensitive load information. If the equipment is physically linked to the premise**
(e.g., a hospital has life support equipment), you should NOT specify the life support information on the person. Rather,
transfer to Premise - Misc and specify life support information on the premise.

**NOTE:**
**Alert and C&C. If the base package's C1-LSSL-PER algorithm is enabled on the installation record, and life support /**
sensitive load information is specified, an alert will appear when the person is displayed on control central. In addition,
if a person has life support or sensitive load equipment, it is possible for a different credit & collection severance process
to be kicked off if the person's account associated has overdue debt. Refer to Designing Your Severance Procedures for
more information.

**Person Names are used by Control Central to look for accounts and persons. In addition, a person's primary name is the**
addressee on the person's bill unless overridden by the Override Mailing Name (maintained on the Misc tab). The following
fields display:

- Use Name Type to indicate if the name is an Alias, Alternate Representation, Doing Business As, Legal, or Primary
name. Note, for new persons, a value of Primary is defaulted. The values for the name type field are customizable using
the Lookup table. This field name is NAME_TYPE_FLG

- Use Person Name to define the person's name. Note well, the name is case sensitive.

**NOTE:**
**Alternate representations of a person's name. You would use an Alternate Representation for a person's name when**
you have an alternate ways to define the person's primary name. Alternate representations are typically used in countries
that use multiple character sets (e.g., the Primary name is entered in Chinese, the Alternate Representation is entered in
English). When a person has an alternate name, both the main and alternate names can be used to search for a person.
The Alternate Representation Name Type only appears if you have enabled alternate names on the installation record.
Refer to the description of the Alternate Representation field under Installation - Main for more information.

**Validation and formatting are performed by plug-ins. The validation that is applied to Person Name (e.g., a comma**
separating the last and first name - Smith,Patricia ) is controlled by a plug-in algorithm on the installation record. More
than one algorithm can be plugged into this plug-in spot. Algorithms plugged into this plug-in spot can also perform
formatting such as removing special characters that your implementation’s business rules do not allow in person names.
Other algorithms can be configured to remove or replace text.

- The Do Not Format switch can be used to bypass any person name formatting done by the algorithms described above.
Validation such as requiring name separator is still applied, but no further formatting is applied. Setting the switch only
applies while the record is being saved and is then reset. The switch is reset because the formatting is only applied when
the record is subsequently changed. This switch is only shown if the Enable Person Name Format Bypass Option Type
on the Customer Information Options Feature Configuration has been enabled


-----

**NOTE:** The Person Phone grid appears when the Legacy Person Phone and Email Option Type on the Customer
Information Options Feature Configuration has been enabled.

**Person Phone numbers are used by Control Central to look for accounts and persons. The following fields display:**

- **Phone Type indicates the type of phone number, e.g., Home, Mobile, Business, ...**

- Use Phone Number to define the telephone number. Enter the telephone number in the format described by the Phone
**Format.**

**NOTE:**
**Formatting is performed by a plug-in. The format that is applied to a Phone Number is controlled by the algorithm**
that is plugged in on the respective Phone Type. If you prefer a different format, your system administrator should
configure this algorithm appropriately.

- Enter the Extension, if any, of the telephone number.

**Person Contacts provide a central location to capture contact information such as phone numbers and email addresses. Any**
contact information can be captured. Person Contacts are used on contact preferences for notifications.

While person contacts can be used in lieu of a person phone and all system processes such as start/stop and orders support
person contacts, your implementation may still opt to use person phone. Functionality has been provided to create and
maintain person contacts from person phone records. When a person contact type is associated with a phone type, the person
contact cannot be deleted nor can the fields maintained via person phone be edited. Refer to Maintaining Person Contact via
Person Phone for more information.

Person contacts can also be edited or created from the Account Contact Information Zone. (See Account - Account Portal
_for more information.)_

- **Contact Routing represents a general grouping of person contacts such as email or phone. It is displayed on this page,**
and is defined on the person contact type.

**NOTE:** Contact Routings of type whose Contact Routing type is Self Service User can be viewed here and not
elsewhere in the system. Furthermore, they can be viewed, but not edited, added, or deleted.

- **Person Contact Type indicates the type of contact such as, home phone, cell phone, or work email.**

- **Contact Information contains the specific contact information such as, the phone number or email address. Enter the**
contact information in the format described.

**NOTE:**
**Formatting is performed by a plug-in. The format that is applied to Contact Information is controlled by the**
algorithm that is plugged in on the respective person contact type (refer to Setting Up Person Contact Types for
more information). If you prefer a different format, your system administrator should configure this algorithm
appropriately.

- Enter the Extension, if any, of the contact information. (This field is only active when the contact’s contact routing is
phone or fax.)

- The Primary switch must be set for exactly one person contact for each contact routing.

- **Do Not Disturb (From) and Do Not Disturb (To) indicate the times when a person contact should not be used. (Note:**
these fields are active when the Person Contact Type’s Allow Do Not Disturb information is set to Optional.

- **Contact Status indicates the option contact’s status. The initial status can be defaulted from the Person Contact Type.**
The status can be manually maintained, as appropriate. (Note: This dropdown is enabled when the Person Contact Type
allows Status to be used. It is also disabled when the person contact type’s status is configured to be controlled by a
process such as an Opt-In process.) See Person Contact Status Can Be Controlled By A Process for more information.


-----

- **Opt-in provides functionality to initiate an opt-in process for person contact types configured to support opt-in. This is**
used to obtain permission to use the person contact type to send notifications. (Note: The functionality on this page is not
the primary way of initiating an opt-in process.) See Person Contact Status Can Be Controlled By A Process for more
information about Opt-In Processes.

- **Active/Inactive defaults to Active. Most contact preferences will remain active. When the contact information changes,**
the information on the existing contact should be updated.

**WARNING:**
It is strongly recommended that existing contacts are updated whenever possible such as when a person’s phone
number or email address changes. When a person no longer has a contact such as an alternate phone number, the
contact should be deleted. Inactive should only be used when the person contact cannot be deleted because it is
referenced on another object such as a contact preference.

- **Contact Nickname (display only) if you implementation is using self-service, users can assign nicknames to contacts**
and they are shown here.

A Person's ID's have several uses:

- They are used by Control Central when you look for a customer / premise based on their ID.

- They are used to highlight potential duplicate persons.

- Control Central displays a person's primary identification in the search results area to help a user identify the customer
when multiple customers match the search criteria.

**NOTE:**
**Person ID may be required or optional. The person ID usage flag on the installation record indicates whether at least**
one id for a person is required or optional.

**NOTE:** The system supports encryption for Person Identifier. If your implementation has configured the system
to encrypt Person Identifier, the data will be displayed with a masked value; such as, *******.Refer to Encrypting
Sensitive Data for more information.

The following fields are used to define a person's ID(s).

- Turn on Primary ID for the piece of ID that is the primary means of identifying the customer.

- Indicate the ID Type. The ID Type defaults from the Installation Record based on the Person Type ( Person versus
Business ).

- Enter the identification number in the adjacent fields. Please note that if the ID Number should be formatted (e.g.,
dashes in an American social security number), you do not have to enter the dashes. Rather, you can enter the
information as a contiguous value and the system will format this for you. The format is shown in the adjacent Identifier
**Format column.**

**NOTE:**
**Formatting is performed by a plug-in. The format that is applied to an ID Number (e.g., dashes in an American social**
security number) is controlled by the algorithm that is plugged in on the respective ID Type. If you prefer a different
format, your system administrator should configure this algorithm appropriately.

If you want to add an account for the person when you save the person information, turn on Add Account and Start
**Service. When this switch is on, you must also define the new account's Customer Class. If this information is specified,**
the system creates a new account and links the person to the account using the relationship type from the installation
options. In addition, you will be transferred to Start / Stop where you can start service for the newly added account.


-----

If you have set the Installation Option CIS Division Control flag, you must first define the new account's CIS Division. The
values are restricted to the user’s CIS Division(s). See Users and CIS Division for more information. The value is defaulted
to user’s primary CIS Division. The new account’s Customer Class must then be defined.

**NOTE:**
**Default note. The account's customer class defaults from the Installation Record based on the Person Type (Person or**
Business). If shown, the customer class defaults first from the CIS Division and then from the Installation Record, each
based on the Person Type (Person or Business)

A message appears in the lower right corner of the page that describes the number of accounts the person has. You can click
the adjacent go to button to transfer to Control Central - Customer Information on which all of a person's accounts appear.

###### Person - Correspondence Information

This page contains information that may be used to address bills, letters, quotes and statements. Use Menu > Customer
**Information > Person > Search and navigate to the Correspondence Info page.**

**Description of Page**

If the person does not want their primary name (defined on the Main page) used on bills, letters, quotes and / or statements,
specify the desired name in Override Mailing Name 1, 2, and 3.

Specify the Override Mailing Address fields if the person wants their bills, letters, quotes, and / or statements sent to
an address other than their service addresses (for example, a post office box). In addition, if the person's account doesn't
already indicate that the person's mailing address should be used, you must update this person's account(s). This information
resides in the Address Source field on Account - Person.

**NOTE:**
Both the Start/Stop and Order transactions allow you to update the person's Override Mailing Address and their
account's address source using a single transaction.

**Address isn't everything. In addition to defining the person's Override Mailing Address, there may be additional**
tasks you must perform in order to route information to this address. Refer to the following links for more information:
where are bills sent, where are letters sent, where are quotes sent and where are statements sent.

If you enter an Override Mailing Address:

- The Country defaults from your installation options.

- The address constituents may differ depending on the Country. Refer to Defining Countries for more information on the
address constituents.

- If you have set up postal defaults, the system will default the address constituents when you tab out of the postal code.

- The Validate button on the person page will only be available if you have set the Allow Address Validation option
type to Y on the General System Configuration feature configuration. Once clicked, the Address Validation Script
on the General System Configuration feature configuration will be invoked to validate the entered address. Refer to
Implementing Address Validation for more information.

Specify the customer's Email Address if you communicate with the customer via Email. In addition to defining the person's
**Email Address, you're correspondence routing software must support sending the information via Email. Refer to the**
following links for more information: where are bills sent, where are letters sent, where are quotes sent and where are
statements sent.

**NOTE:** The Email Address field appears when Legacy Person Phone and Email Option Type on the Customer
Information Options Feature Configuration has been enabled.


-----

Define the Language in which the person prefers their bills and correspondence printed.

**NOTE:**
**Default note. The person's language defaults from Installation Options - Person.**

**FASTPATH:**
Refer to Customer Language for more information on options for supporting multiple languages for your customers.

Define the person’s Time Zone preference if it is different from the installation’s time zone. Refer to Installation Options
– Framework, Main Page for more information. The time zone appears as part of the display anywhere the Do Not Disturb
start and end information is displayed; for example, in the Person Portal or Account Portal.

**NOTE:** **Default Note. The Time Zone defaults to blank, which indicates that the installation’s time zone will be used.**

The Seasonal Addresses scroll is only used if the person wants their correspondence sent to an alternate address during
predefined periods. For example, the customer may want their bills sent to their vacation cottage during the summer. Please
be aware of the following:

- Seasonal addresses will only be used if the customer's bills, statements, quotes, and / or letters are routed via the postal
service. For example, if you route bills to the customer via Email, the seasonal address will never be used to route bills
to the customer. Refer to the following links for more information: where are bills sent, where are letters sent, where are
quotes sent and where are statements sent.

- You don't have to specify a seasonal address for every part of the year. For example, if the customer wants their bills sent
to their service address except during the summer, you need only enter a seasonal address for the summer.

- You can enter a seasonal address with or without an Override Mailing Address. If an Override Mailing Address is
not specified, the person's correspondence will be addressed as per the instructions on the person's account(s). These
instructions reside in the Address Source field on Account - Person.

- You can enter multiple seasonal addresses if the customer so desires.

- The Seasonal period is defined in the two adjacent fields. The first field contains the day and month when the season
starts; the second field contains the day and month when the season ends. The day and month should be entered in the
format defined in your display profile.

- The Status of the address must be Active. You can set the status to Inactive if you want a seasonal address ignored
(alternately, you can just remove the seasonal address).

- The Country defaults from your installation options. The address constituents may differ depending on the Country.
Refer to Defining Countries for more information on the address constituents.

- If you have set up postal defaults, the system will default the address constituents when you tab out of the postal code.

###### Person - Characteristics

The characteristics page contains information that describes miscellaneous information about the person. Use Menu >
**Customer Information > Person > Search and navigate to the Characteristics page.**

**Description of Page**

**NOTE:**
You can only choose characteristic types defined as permissible on the person record. Refer to Setting Up Characteristic
Types & Their Values for more information.

The following fields display:


-----

**Effective Date Define the date on which the characteristic becomes effective. The effective date defaults from the**
Installation Record.

**Characteristic Type Indicate the type of characteristic.**

**Characteristic Value Indicate the value of the characteristic.**

###### Person - Persons

This page is used to define this person's relationship with other persons. For example, if the person being maintained is
a conglomerate, you can define its subsidiaries on this page. Refer to How To Set Up Customer Hierarchies for more
information about hierarchies.

**NOTE:**
**You're defining "child relationships". It's important to understand that the persons being defined on this page's grid**
should be thought of as "children" of the person on the top of the page.

**Children may have children. It's possible for one of the children to have children itself (for example, if you have a**
situation where a subsidiary of a conglomerate itself has subsidiaries). To define a child's children, simply display the
child person on this page and then define its children.

**Equal relationships. It's possible to link persons where no hierarchy is implied by the relationship (e.g., spouses). There**
are two ways to do this: 1) you can nominate one spouse as the "parent" and the other as the "child" or 2) you can define
the spousal relationship for both persons (i.e., you would define Robert Chopin as the husband of Jeanette Chopin, and
Jeanette Chopin as the wife of Robert Chopin). If you choose the latter approach, a recursive relationship will exist.

**WARNING:**
If your organization enters multiple levels of person, we want to note that we do not prevent recursive relationships.
This means that you could set up a nonsensical situation where person 2 is a child of person 1 and person 1 is a child of
person 2.

Use Menu > Customer Information > Person > Search and navigate to the Persons page.

**Description of Page**

The grid contains the "children" associated with the "parent" person who is defined at the top of the page. The following
fields display:

**Child Person This is the unique identifier of the "child" person. This person's main name appears adjacent.**

**Child Information An informational message appears to highlight if the child person itself has children. You can click the**
corresponding go to button to view the child's children.

**Relationship Type Indicate the type of relationship between the parent and the child person.**

**Start Date Indicate the date on which this relationship began. This field defaults from the Installation Record.**

**End Date If the relationship expires, indicate the date the relationship stops.**

**Financial Relationship Turn on this switch if the child person has account(s) and information about these account(s)**
should be displayed when the parent person's hierarchy is displayed in the Active Account Summary Zone.

###### Person - Person Portal

Select Menu > Customer Information > Person > Search and navigate to the Person Portal page to view additional
information associated with a Person.

Depending on your implementations requirements, you may define additional zones to appear on this Portal.


-----

The contents of this section describe the zones that are available on this portal page.

Refer to the zone help for more details.

###### Maintaining Accounts

The account record contains information that controls billing and collection processes. You should only need to use this
page if you need to fine-tune the information that the system has set up by default because:

- Most accounts are created when you add a new person or when you complete an order for a new customer.

- Many fields are populated behind-the-scenes as part of the service activation process.

The topics in this section describe the pages on which account related information is maintained.

**FASTPATH:**
For more information about accounts and their place in the "V", refer to Understanding The "V".

###### Account - Main Information

The Main page contains core account information. Open this page using Menu > Customer Information > Account >
**Search.**

**Description of Page**

The primary name of the Account's main customer and the Account ID are displayed on every tab in this page. These
values only appear after the account exists on the database. The Account ID is a system-assigned random number that stays
with an account for life.

**NOTE:**
**Formatting may be performed by a plug-in. The basic information about an account that appears at the top of this**
page (and on many other pages in the system) may be formatted by a plug-in algorithm on the installations record. Refer
to the base package's account information algorithm (C1–AC-INFO) for an example. If you prefer different formatting
logic, your system administrator should configure the system appropriately.

A "check digit" is displayed adjacent to the account ID. This is for information purposes only, and is not needed to operate
the system. The following points describe how the check digit is calculated for an Account ID equal to 0011883422

- Calculate the sum of the first and every alternate digit in the account id. A = 14 = 0+1+8+3+2

- Calculate the sum of the second and every alternate digit in the Account ID and multiply by 2. For example, B = 30 = (0
+ 1 + 8 + 4 + 2) * 2

- Add A and B. For example, C = 44 = 14 + 30

- Count the number of digits used to calculate B that are greater than 4. For example, D = 1 since only 8 is greater than 4.

- Multiply D by 9. For example, E = 9 = 1 x 9

- Subtract E from C. For example, F = 35 = 44 - 9


-----

- Subtract the units position of F from 10 to find the check digit. For example, check digit = 5 = 10 - 5 (5 is subtracted
from 10 because F = 35 and there the units position is 5).

**NOTE:**
**Technical note. The above is calculated in the common routine called CIPCACDN .**

**Set Up Date is the date the account was initially set up. This is purely informational.**

**Currency Code defines the currency in which the account's financial transactions are expressed. All rates and payments**
associated with this account must be denominated in this currency.

**NOTE:**
**Default note. The currency defaults from the Installation Record and may be overridden here.**

**Customer Class plays a part in:**

- If and when a customer is subject to late payment charges.

- The account's default collection class and when the account debt monitor reviews an account. Refer to The Big Picture of
Credit & Collections for more information about how and when an account's debt is reviewed.

- And several other functions. Refer to and Setting Up Customer Classes for more information.

**NOTE:**
**Default note. The customer class defaults from Installation Options - Account (Person Customer Class) and may be**
overridden at will. If you have set the Installation Option CIS Division Control flag, the customer class defaults first
from the CIS Division and then from the Installation Record. When this option is set, the CIS Division is shown on the
page before customer class. You may only select Customer Classes with the account’s CIS Division.

**CIS Division defines the jurisdiction that governs this account. You may only select CIS Divisions associated with the**
account's Customer Class. If you have set the Installation Option CIS Division Control flag, you need to choose the CIS
Division before choosing the Customer Class. The values are restricted to the user’s CIS Division(s). See Users and CIS
Division ngfor more information. The value is defaulted to user’s primary CIS Division. This field is updated behind
the scenes every time a service agreement is activated (the system uses the CIS Division associated with the service
agreement's SA type). If you have assigned a CIS Division and do not want the system to change it when a service
agreement is activated, turn on Protect CIS Division. If the CIS Division’s Restrict to Account CIS Division flag is set to
_Restricted, the Protect CIS Division is turned on and cannot be turned off._

**NOTE:**
**CIS Division governs many functions. An account's CIS Division impacts its subsequent bill due dates, late payment**
charge dates, credit & collections review dates, its default budget plan, the roles assigned to To Do entries, and the
calendar of workdays. Refer to Setting Up CIS Divisions and Setting Up Customer Classes for more information.

**Access Group controls which users are allowed to view and update this account's information (including bills, service**
agreements, payments, and premises). The system defaults this value from one of three sources, stopping after an access
group is determined. The first is the Customer Class Control – Determine Access Group system event. The next is the
access group defined directly on Customer Class Control. Lastly, it is defaulted from the user's default access group. Refer
to The Big Picture of Row Security for a complete description of how account security is implemented in the system.

The optional Account Management Group controls the roles assigned to To Do entries associated with an account. Refer
to Setting Up Account Management Groups for more information.

Enter a Comment to define unusual information about the account. If this field is populated, an alert will highlight such in
the Alert Zone.


-----

**Bill Cycle controls when a bill is produced for an account. This field is updated behind the scenes every time a service**
agreement with a service point is activated. The route the system takes to do this update is as follows:

- It looks for all service points linked to the service agreement.

- It extracts the service cycle from one of the service points.

- Finally, it takes the bill cycle from the service cycle.

**NOTE:**
The list of bill cycles is restricted to those without a CIS Division and those with a CIS Division that matches the
account’s CIS Division. When the account does not have a CIS Division, the list is not restricted.

While this is a little complicated, it makes sense because it keeps the bill cycle in sync with the service cycle.

If you have assigned a bill cycle and do not want the system to change the bill cycle when a service agreement is activated,
turn on Protect Bill Cycle.

If you want to stall billing until after some future date, enter the date in Bill After. Note that the bill’s cutoff date should be
after this date, for the account to bill.

**Mailing Premise ID defines the address on bills for persons who have their bill sent to the account's mailing premise. This**
field may be updated behind the scenes when a service agreement is activated. The word "may" is used because the system
will only update an account's mailing premise if there are no active service agreements currently linked to the account.
Refer to Account - Person Information for more information about how to define where a person has their correspondence
and bills sent.

If you do not want the mailing premise to change when a service agreement is activated, turn on Protect Mailing Premise.

If a user should review the account's printed bills before they are sent to the customer in an on-going basis, enter this user’s
ID in Bill Print Intercept. This User ID will then be copied to future Bill - Bill Routing pages when they are created. If the
user no longer desires to intercept future bills, their User ID can be removed from this field.

The balances shown in the scroll are the total amounts of debt belonging to every debt class linked to the account's service
agreements. The following information is displayed:

- **Debt Class is the debt class associated with the account's service agreement(s).**

- **Current Balance is the amount of debt the customer currently owes.**

- **Payoff Balance is the amount the customer would owe if they wanted to pay off their debt.**

To see summary information about the service agreements that contribute to the financial totals click the go to button
adjacent to the respective amount.

**WARNING:**
If you do not understand the difference between payoff balance and current balance, refer to Current Amount versus
Payoff Amount.

###### Account - Auto Pay

The Auto Pay page is used when an account pays their bills automatically (e.g., by direct debit or credit card).

**FASTPATH:**
Refer toHow And When Are Automatic Payments Created for more information.

Open Menu > Customer Information > Account > Search and navigate to the Auto Pay page to maintain this
information.


-----

**Description of Page**

The Account Auto Pay scroll defines the bank account / credit card from which the customer's automatic payments are
debited. Multiple auto-pay options may exist if the customer changes auto-pay options over time. The following fields
display:

- **Start Date is the date on which the automatic payment information comes into effect. The system creates an automatic**
payment for any bill produced for this account with a due date on/after this date and on/before the End Date. If End
**Date is not specified, this means the automatic payment option applies indefinitely. You need only specify an End Date**
if the customer wants to stop paying automatically.

- **Auto Pay ID is the unique, system-assigned identifier of the auto-pay record. This value is assigned after the information**
is saved on the database and may not be modified.

- Use Auto Pay Source to define the source of the funds used to satisfy the automatic payment request. For example,
if a customer indicates that they want to use their checking account to pay their bill, you would specify the Auto Pay
**Source Code associated with their bank. The source's description and external source ID (e.g., bank routing number) are**
displayed adjacent.

- Use Auto Pay Method to specify whether you want the system to process automatic payments as Direct Debit or
Payment Advice. This field is visible only if feature configuration is set up to support payment advice functionality.
Refer to Payment Advices for more information on the payment advice functionality.

- Use External Account ID to define the customer's bank account / credit card number.

**NOTE:**
The system supports encryption for the External Account ID. If your implementation has configured the system
to encrypt the External Account ID, the data will be displayed with a masked value; such as, *******.Refer to
Encrypting Sensitive Data for more information

- You will be required to define an Expires On date if the Auto Pay Source Code references a tender type that requires
an expiration date (e.g., if the Auto Pay Source is a credit card company).

- Enter the Name of the customer as it appears in the financial institution's system. This name is routed to the financial
institution.

**NOTE:**
**Default note. The Name will default to the primary name of the main customer linked to the account after you enter a**
**Start Date. This defaulting is only possible for accounts that exist on the database.**

- In some locales, customers can define a Maximum Withdrawal Amount to limit the amount of money that is
automatically debited from their account. Refer to How To Implement Maximum Withdrawal Amounts for more
information.

- Use Comments to describe anything interesting / unusual about the automatic payment request.

###### Account - Person Information

The Account Persons page contains information about the person(s) linked to the account.

**NOTE:**
Both customers and non-customers (e.g. the accounting service that handles the bills of a commercial customer) can be
linked to an account.

When you add an account from Person - Main or from Order - Main the system automatically links the person to the
account, so you typically won't have to open this page. However, if you need to link multiple persons to an account (e.g.,


-----

because you need to send a duplicate of the account's bill to someone other than the main customer) or change information
about a person on an account, open Menu > Customer Information > Account > Search and navigate to the Persons
page.

**Customer Self Service and Account - Person Information:**

It is possible that an implementation may have configured the system to integrate with Customer Self-Service. Account Persons can be created through the self-service application and will use a reserved relationship type that is defined on the
self-service master configuration.

Records with this relationship type can be thought of as “owned by the self-service application.” Changes to fields on the
page are disabled because the record can be deleted by the self-service application.

You can change the relationship type to another value, which will indicate that the record is no longer owned by selfservice. Self-service can no longer delete this record and changes are allowed to the fields on the page. Please note that the
relationship cannot be changed back to the self-service designation

**Description of Page**

The Account Persons scroll contains one entry for every person linked to the account. The following fields display:

**Person ID The unique identifier of the person linked to the account. The person's name is displayed adjacent.**

**Main Customer Turn on this switch if the person is the main customer on the account. Only one person on an account may**
be designated as the main customer.

The significance of the main customer is that its name will appear adjacent to the account ID throughout the system.

**Financially Responsible Turn on this switch if the person is financially responsible for the account's debt.**

This switch is on and gray if the person is the Main Customer because the main customer is always financially responsible.
If multiple persons are linked to the account, you use this switch to indicate which ones are financially responsible versus
those that are linked for other purposes.

**Third Party Guarantor Turn on this switch if the person is a third party guarantor of the account's debt. This switch is off**
and gray if the person is the Main Customer.

**Relationship Type Define the relationship between the person and the account. Refer to Setting Up Account Relationship**
Codes for information about setting up relationship types.

**NOTE:**
**Default note. When the system links the person to the account when you add an account from Person - Main, it defaults**
the relationship type from the Installation Record.

Self-Service Role indicates that the Account - Person record has a corresponding entry in the self service application and
contains the value for the access in self-service. If there is no corresponding entry in self-service, this field will not display.
If configured in the Self-Service Master Configuration, a hyperlink appears allowing direct access to self-service.

**Prefix/Suffix and Pfx/Sfx Name Use these fields if you need to append additional information to a customer's name when**
correspondence or bills are sent to this person. For example, if the account has declared bankruptcy you might attach
"Debtor In Possession" to the person's name. Use Prefix/Suffix to indicate if the Pfx/Sfx Name should be appended to the
front or the back of the customer's name.

**Receives Copy of Bill Turn on this switch if the person receives a copy of the account's bills. Turning off this switch grays**
the remaining fields. This switch is on and gray if the person is the Main Customer because the main customer always
receives a copy of the bill.

**FASTPATH:**
Refer to The Source Of Bill Routing Information for more information about how the remaining information is used to
format the address of a bill.

**Bill Route Type Indicate how the bill is sent to the customer. This field's value defaults from the Installation Record.**

Validation for more information.

**Allow Communication Preference: Turn on this switch if person contacts can be used on communication preferences for**
this account. The switch is on and disabled when the person is the Main Customer because their contact information can
always be used on contact preferences for notifications.

###### Account - Financial Balances

The financial balances page is an information-only page that subdivides an account's debt by debt class. The balances
shown on this page are the total amounts of debt belonging to every debt class linked to the account's service agreements.

**NOTE:**
**The source of debt class. An account's debt comes from its service agreement(s). Every service agreement has an SA**
type. Every SA type references a debt class.

Open Menu > Customer Information > Account > Search and navigate to the Financial Balances page.

**Description of Page**

The account's Current Balance displays at the top of the page.

The Debt Class Balances scroll contains one entry for every debt class linked to the accounts non-closed / non-cancelled
service agreements. The following information is displayed for each debt class.

- **Debt Class is the debt class associated with the account's service agreement(s). To see summary information about the**
service agreements that contribute to the debt class totals click the adjacent Go To button.

- **Current Balance is the amount of debt the customer currently owes.**

- **Payoff Balance is the amount the customer would owe if they wanted to pay off their debt. Payoff balance is only**
displayed if it differs from current balance.

**WARNING:**


-----

If you do not understand the difference between payoff balance and current balance, refer to Current Amount versus
Payoff Amount.

- The Debt Class Arrears shows the age of all amounts that make up the current balance.

- The Days Old and Amount information shows the age of the debt class's debt.

**NOTE:**
Information about debt balances by age is not applicable to open-item accounts.

###### Account - Bill Messages

The Account Message page contains information about the message(s) to appear on an account's bills. Both one-time
and permanent messages may be defined. This information is used when the system assembles messages to appear on an
account's bill. Refer to The Source of Bill Messages for more information about bill messages.

Open Menu > Customer Information > Account > Search and navigate to the Bill Messages page.

**Description of Page**

The following fields are displayed:

**Bill Message The message code and description of the message that appears on the customer's bill.**

**Bill Message Type Use Temporary to indicate the message should only be linked to the next bill produced for the account.**
Use Permanent if the message should appear on every bill. Note, a value of Temporary defaults.

###### Account - C&C

The Credit Rating page contains the credit rating transactions that impact an account's credit rating and cash-only score. To
view or modify these transactions, open Menu > Customer Information > Account > Search and navigate to the C&C
page.

**Description of Page**

**Collection Class controls how the account's debt is compared against collection criteria to determine if a collection process**
should be started. Refer to The Big Picture of Credit & Collections for more information about how and when an account's
debt is reviewed.

**NOTE:**
**Default note. The Collection Class defaults from the account's customer class when the account is first added. It may**
be overridden at will.

If you need to prevent an account from being reviewed by credit and collections processes (i.e., the account debt monitor
and the write-off monitor), use Postpone Credit Review Until to define the future date when these processes can again
review the account's debt.

**Last Credit Review Date is the date when the account's debt was last reviewed by the account debt monitor (ADM).**

**NOTE:**
**Forced ADM review. If you want the account debt monitor to review an account's debt the next time it runs, simply**
change the Credit Review Date to a date in the distant past (e.g., 1/1/1900). The next time the ADM background


-----

process runs with the Include Minimum Days Review (Y/N) set to Y, it'll see that a great deal of time has passed since
the last time it reviewed the account's debt and review it (and then set the Credit Review Date accordingly).

The account's Current Credit Rating is displayed. For an explanation of how this number is derived, see How is an
account's credit rating calculated?.

The account's Current Cash-Only Score is displayed. For an explanation of how this number is derived, see How is an
account's cash-only score calculated?.

The Credit Rating History scroll contains one entry for each credit rating history record associated with the account. The
following fields display:

**Start Date This is the first date the credit rating transaction affects the account's credit rating and cash-only score.**

**End Date This is the last date the credit rating transaction affects the account's credit rating and cash-only score.**

The Created On message is formatted using an algorithm on the Installation Options.

**Affect Credit Rating By This is the effect of the credit rating transaction on the account's credit score. This should be a**
_negative number because the lower the score the worse the credit rating._

An account's credit rating is equal to the start credit rating amount defined on the installation record plus the sum of credit
rating demerits that are currently in effect. When an account's credit rating is less than the credit rating threshold defined on
the installation record, the account's credit rating is displayed as an alert in the Alert Zone.

**Affect Cash-Only Score By This is the effect of the credit rating transaction on the account's cash-only score. The higher**
the score, the greater the chance this account will be marked as cash-only. Therefore, a positive number should be used to
make the score go up.

An account's cash-only score is equal to the start cash-only score defined on the installation record plus the sum of cashonly points that are currently in effect. When an account's cash-only score exceeds the cash-only threshold score defined on
the installation record, the account is flagged as cash-only in the Alert Zone and on the payment event page.

**Comments Enter comments to clarify the reason(s) for the creation of the transaction.**

###### How are credit rating transactions created?

Credit rating transactions may be created as follows:

- Certain types of severance events add credit rating transactions. The number of credit rating and cash-only points is
defined on the severance event type.

- Certain types of severance events add credit rating transactions. The number of credit rating and cash-only points is
defined on the severance event type.

- Certain types of write-off events add credit rating transactions. The number of credit rating and cash-only points is
defined on the write-off event type.

- If a payment tender is canceled with a cancellation reason that indicates the cancellation was due to non-sufficient
funds, a credit rating transaction is created. The number of credit rating and cash-only points is defined on the payment
cancellation reason code.

- You may configure your system to create a credit rating transaction when a pay plan is broken. To do this, you must plug
in an appropriate Broken Algorithm on the pay plan type.

- A user may create credit rating transactions at their discretion.

- Algorithms may add credit rating transactions. The system provides sample overdue event and cut event activation
algorithms that add credit rating transactions. Refer to C1-OE-CR-RT and C1-CE-CR-RT for more information. Some
examples of algorithms your implementation may decide to introduce: the creation of a late payment charge. To do this
you could introduce a new adjustment freeze algorithm.


-----

**NOTE:**
**Created By Flag. The credit rating transaction includes a Created By flag that is customizable using the Lookup table.**
This field name is CR_RAT_CRE_BY_FLG. If your implementation uses algorithms to create credit rating history
transactions, you may consider adding appropriate values to the Created By flag. Also note that the Created By flag
includes the value Other, which may be used by your implementation specific algorithms if you do not want to add a
new custom value.

###### How is credit rating calculated?

An account's credit rating is calculated by summing the Affect on Credit Rating from credit rating transactions effective
on the current date. This value is added to the beginning credit rating defined on the installation record. The result is the
customer's current credit rating.

**NOTE:** CIS Division can override the beginning credit rating. The system processes first check the account’s CIS
Division to see if the beginning credit rating has been specified on the CIS Division.

###### What impact does credit rating have in the system?

The following points describe the impact of an account's credit rating:

- An account's current credit rating is displayed in the Control Central Alert area when it's less than the threshold credit
rating defined on the installation record.

- An account's credit rating may affect how the account's debt is collected. We used the word "may" because an account's
credit rating will only affect collection criteria if you set up your collection processes to do this.

**FASTPATH:**
For more information, refer to Designing Your Collection Class Control Overrides.

###### How is cash-only score calculated?

An account's cash-only score is calculated by summing the Affect on Cash-Only Score from credit rating transactions
effective on the current date. This value is added to the beginning cash-only score defined on the installation record. The
result is the customer's current cash-only score.

**NOTE:** CIS Division can override the beginning cash-only score. The system processes first check the account’s CIS
Division to see if the beginning cash-only score has been specified on the CIS Division.

###### What impact does cash-only score have in the system?

If an account's current cash-only score exceeds the cash-only threshold on the installation record, and the base package's
C1-CASH-ACCT algorithm is enabled on the installation record:

- The customer is flagged as cash-only in the Control Central Alert area.

- If a user attempts to add a payment whose tender type is a cash-equivalent, a warning is issued.

###### Account - Budget

The Budget page contains information about all service agreements linked to an account that are eligible to participate in a
budget billing plan. Refer to Budget Billing for more information about how this information affects the account's bills.

**NOTE:**
**You are actually changing service agreements. When you change a service agreement's budget amount on this page,**
you are actually changing the service agreement's recurring charge amount. Refer to Service Agreement - Recurring
Charge for more information.

**Eligible service agreements. It's important to be aware that some service agreements linked to an account may not be**
eligible for budget plans. For example, assume you have a customer with a deposit service agreement and one or more
utility service agreements. This customer will be billed for their deposit regardless of the utility service agreements'
budget amounts. You define whether a service agreement may participate in a budget plan on the service agreement's SA
type.

Open Menu > Customer Information > Account > Search and navigate to the Budget page to view this information.

**Description of Page**

The appearance and dialogue of this page differs slightly for an account with a small number of service agreements (100 or
less) versus a large number of service agreements (more than 100).

- For an account with a small number of service agreements, the user may click the Recommend Budget button to
generate a New Budget for each service agreement. At that point the service agreement's budget amount has not been
updated. The user may review the calculated amounts; make desired changes and then click Save to update the budget
amount for the service agreements.

**WARNING:**
You must save the page in order for the budget changes to take effect.

- For an account with a large number of service agreements, the user may click the Calculate and Apply New Budget
button. At that point the system will calculate the recommended budget and update the Budget Amount on all the
eligible service agreements. To change the budget amount for one or more of the service agreements, the user navigates
to the service agreement page using the drill down button adjacent to the service agreement in question.

Click Cancel Budget to have the system set the New Budget amount to zero for all the account's service agreements on
budget.

**NOTE:**
**Budget Recommendation. Though this page lists all SAs eligible for a budget, the budget recommendation only**
calculates a budget amount for SAs whose start and end date (if any) includes the budget date.

**Budget Plan controls how the account's debt is managed for budget-related purposes. Specifically, it controls how the**
recommended budget amount is calculated and how / when the customer's budget is periodically changed.

**NOTE:**
**Default note. Budget plan defaults based on the account's customer class / division combination.**

The list of budget plans is restricted to those without a CIS Division and those with a CIS Division that matches the
account’s CIS Division. When the account does not have a CIS Division, the list is not restricted


-----

Use New Budget Date to define the effective date of any changes to the customer's budget amount (this date is the effective
date on the respective service agreements' recurring charge history).

The system displays the sum of the service agreements' current budget amounts in Current Account Budget.

For accounts with a small number of service agreements, the system displays the sum of the service agreements' new budget
amounts in Recommended Account Budget.

The grid that follows contains a row for each service agreement linked to the account that is eligible to participate in a
budget billing plan:

**SA Information This is a concatenation of basic information about the service agreement.**

**Last Changed Date This is the date when the service agreement's budget amount (i.e., recurring charge amount) was last**
changed.

**Current Budget This is the existing budget amount (i.e., recurring charge amount) for the service agreement.**

**Recommended Budget For accounts with a small number of service agreements, the service agreement's budget amount**
(i.e., recurring charge amount) will be changed to reflect this value when the page is changed. The effective date of the
change is defined in New Budget Date.

###### Account - Deposits

The Deposits page contains information about all cash and non-cash deposits linked to an account.

**NOTE:**
**Cash versus Non-cash Deposits. Non-cash deposits (e.g., letters of credit, surety bonds, 3rd party deposits) can be**

###### Account - Account Portal

Select Menu > Customer Information > Account > Search and navigate to the Account Portal page to view additional
information associated with an Account.

Depending on your implementations requirements, you may define additional zones to appear on this Portal.

The contents of this section describe the zones that are available on this portal page.

**General Information displays Account ID and Account Info**

**Account Contact Information Displays person contacts that are associated with the account in context. Only records for**
persons that allow communication preferences are shown.

- This zone provides the ability to add or edit existing person contacts. The edit functionality is limited. This provides
a convenient way to edit basic information for person contacts. When adding a person contact, person contact types
associated with phone types are not available.

- Full maintenance of person contacts can be performed on the Person – Person Contacts page.

**Push Communication Preferences Displays contact preferences and opt-out preferences for push-based notification types;**
meaning, those notifications that customers do not need to subscribe in order to receive. You can maintain the customer's
preferred method(s) of contact (the preferences) for receiving these notifications, or process a customer's request to opt out
of receiving them.

**NOTE:**
Push notifications have parent and individual notification types. Communication preferences are established for parent
notification types. The individual notification types reference a parent notification type and define the message to be
sent using the preferences established for the parent. As mentioned, for push notifications a subscription is not needed; a
default contact can be determined in the absence of contact or opt-out preferences.

Not all notification types are relevant to all customers. Notification types can be configured with a suppression criteria
algorithm that can prevent some notification types from appearing. It is possible that a notification type was suppressed
after active contact preferences were set up. These notification types and their contact preferences are also shown when
the filter is set to show inactive preferences.

- Refer to Push vs. Subscription Notification Types and Parent vs. Individual Push Notification Types for more
information.

- Please see the zone's help text for information about this zone's fields.

**Subscription Communication Preferences Zone displays contact preferences for subscription-based notification**
types - meaning those notifications to which customers need to subscribe in order to receive them. You can maintain the
customer's preferred method(s) of contact (the preferences) for receiving these notifications. A notification for subscriptionbased notification cannot be sent without an active contact preference. Opting out is not applicable to subscription-based
notification types.

**NOTE:**
Unlike push notifications, communication preferences are established for the subscription notification types, which also
defines the message to be sent.

Not all notification types are relevant to all customers. Notification types can be configured with a suppression criteria
algorithm that can prevent some notification types from appearing. It is possible that a notification type was suppressed
after active contact preferences were set up. These notification types and their contact preferences are also shown when
the filter is set to show inactive preferences.

- Refer to Push vs. Subscription Notification Types

- Please see the zone's help text for information about this zone's fields.

This is an information-only page that shows an account's service agreements grouped by debt class.

**NOTE:**
**The source of debt class. An account's debt comes from its service agreement(s). Every service agreement has an SA**
type. Every SA type references a debt class.

To access this page, drill down on a debt class shown on Menu > Customer Information > Account > Search.

**Description of Page**

The Account ID and the primary name of the account's main customer are displayed.

**Debt Class is the debt class associated with the account's service agreement(s).**

**NOTE:**
An account may have service agreements that belong to other debt classes. Navigate to Account - Main Information to
see a list of all debt classes associated with an account.

The Service Agreement scroll contains one entry for each service agreement that belongs to the Debt Class. The following
information is displayed for each service agreement.

- **SA (service agreement) Info is a concatenation of important details about the service agreement.**

- **Premise defines the service agreement's main premise.**

- **Current Balance is the amount of debt the customer currently owes.**

- **Payoff Balance is the amount the customer would owe if they wanted to pay off their debt. Payoff balance is only**
displayed if it differs from current balance.

**WARNING:**
If you do not understand the difference between payoff balance and current balance, refer to Current Amount versus
Payoff Amount.

- **SA Arrears displays the age of the amounts that make up the current balance.**

- The Days Old and Arrears Amount information shows the age of the service agreement's debt.

**NOTE:**
Information about debt balances by age is not applicable to open-item accounts.

###### Using The Account/Person Replicator

There are two different ways to use this transaction:

- You can make many copies of a given Person / Account combination. This may be required if your company works
with third party agencies who enroll customers on its behalf. In this situation, the third party agency may receive
blocks of pre-allocated account numbers to be used when they enroll a customer. When a customer signs up, the person
information can be updated with information about the newly enrolled customer.

- Perform the following steps if you need to create many copies of a given person and account:


-----

  - Add a new person and account if you don't already have a customer to serve as your "template".

  - Use the Account/Person Replicator to create copies of the person and the account as described below (and make sure
to use the Replicate Acct and Person option).

- You can create many Accounts for a single Person. This may be required if you have a customer who wants many
separate accounts rather than a single consolidated account.

- Perform the following steps if you need to create many copies of a given account for a specific person:

  - Select the account that serves as the template account for the person. Note, this account must be linked to the person
who wants the many accounts.

  - Use the Account/Person Replicator to create copies of the account as described below (and make sure to use the
Replicate Account Only option).

Use Menu > Customer Information > Account/Person Replicator to open this page.

**Description of Page**

Choose the Account that serves as the template account.

**NOTE:**
**Recommendation. Carefully verify that the template account you have chosen is correct before you save the replicated**
accounts. After you save the replicated accounts, any corrections could prove time consuming.

At the top of the page, indicate the Number of accounts and persons to Replicate.

Indicate the Main Person Name Base, which will be used as the main person name for all the new persons to be created.
This field will be protected if you choose a Replicate Type of Replicate Account Only (as no persons are created).

Use Replicate Type to define if you want to create multiple copies of an account for a given person or if you want to create
many new person / account combinations. See the description that appears above for more information about this field.

After entering the above, click the Replicate button to generate your new accounts and persons. The grid displays
informational messages describing what will happen when you click save. For example, it will verify how many accounts
will be created, the person whose record will be copied, the name that will be used on all the new persons, etc..

If everything looks clean, click save.

###### Information Replicated for New Persons

Except for the main name, which you indicate in the Main Person Name field, all information for the main person linked to
the account will be copied to the new persons.

**WARNING:**
This copy includes the person's identification number. This will result in multiple persons with the same identification
number. You should ensure that the identification number for your template person is a temporary number. When you
sign up your actual customer, be sure to update the identification number to a valid number for the person.

###### Information Replicated for New Accounts

Although most information for an account will be copied, not all information will be. The following points describe the
information that is NOT copied on newly replicated accounts:

- Mailing premise will be set to blank


-----

- Setup Date is set to the current date

- Credit Review Date and Postpone Credit Review Until Date will be set to blank

- Auto Pay information will not be copied

- Credit Rating History will not be copied

- Non-cash deposit information will not be copied

**NOTE:**
that all miscellaneous persons linked to the account (i.e., those who are not flagged as Main Customers) will be linked
to the new accounts. With this functionality, for example, you can create a person for a third party enroller and link this
enroller to the template account. This enroller will then be linked to all the new accounts.

###### Maintaining Service Agreements

A service agreement contains the terms and conditions controlling how the system calculates charges for a specific service
supplied to a customer. The topics in this section describe the pages on which service agreement related information is
maintained.

**NOTE:**
**The system creates most service agreements behind the scenes. Most service agreements are created "behind the**
scenes" by the system as part of the Start Service and Order completion processes. You should only have to access the
service agreement pages if you need to fine-tune what the system defaults. Refer to Start/Stop and Maintaining Orders
for the details.

**Service Agreement and Usage Subscription. A Usage Subscription will exist for each ‘usage-oriented’ service agreement.**

**FASTPATH:**
For more information about service agreements and their place in the "V", refer to Understanding The "V". For more
information about the source of information defaulted onto service agreements, refer to Setting Up Start Options.

For more information about Usage Subscription, refer to About Usage Subscriptions.

**WARNING:**
Take special care when adding a new service agreement to specify the appropriate Division and SA Type as it will affect
how the customer is billed, what rate can be specified, how overdue debt is collected, and much more. After the service
agreement is activated, you may not change its SA type.

###### The Lifecycle Of A Service Agreement

The following diagram shows the possible lifecycle of a service agreement.


-----

**Pending Start When you initiate a request to start service, the system initiates a service agreement in the state of Pending**
Start. A pending start service agreement remains in this state until everything necessary to start service is defined in the
system.

**Active The system automatically changes the state of Pending Start service agreements to Active when everything**
necessary to start service exists in the system. Refer to Activating Pending Starts for more information. While in this state,
the system bills the service agreement's account for the service.

**Pending Stop When you initiate a request to stop service, the system progresses the service agreement to the Pending Stop**
state. A pending stop service agreement remains in this state until everything necessary to stop service is defined in the
system.

**Stopped The system automatically changes the state of Pending Stop service agreements to Stopped when everything**
necessary to stop service exists in the system. Refer to Finalizing Pending Stops for more information. The service
agreement remains in this state until it is paid in full.

A service agreement can be automatically stopped depending on the SA Type configuration of the Stop Option Flag.
Service agreements configured to automatically stop will be stopped when all SP related SAs of the account are stopped.
For example, if an account has a cable service and a charitable contribution service agreement then the charitable
contribution service agreement can be configured to automatically stop when the cable service agreement is stopped. The
stop date of the charitable contribution will be set equal to the stop date of the electric SA.

**Closed The system moves a service agreement to the Closed state when it no longer has a financial balance.**

**Reactivated The system moves a service agreement to the Reactivated state if a financial transaction is created after a**
service agreement is Closed (e.g., when a payment is canceled after the service agreement is closed). Please be aware that
Reactivated service agreements are processed by the Write Off Monitor.

When the service agreement once again has a zero balance (e.g., because the customer pays or the debt is written off), the
service agreement returns to the Closed state.

**Cancelled You may Cancel a service agreement if it shouldn't exist (because the customer doesn't want service). While**
cancellation doesn't physically remove a service agreement from the database, most queries and trees suppress information
about canceled service agreements. This means cancellation is a nice way to logically delete undesired service agreements.

You'll notice in the above diagram that you can cancel an Active, Pending Stop or Stopped service agreement. You may
only do this if the service agreement's financial transactions and non-billed billable charges are all cancelled.

You should rarely have to change a service agreement's status. Why? Because the system changes the status behind-thescenes when various events take place. For example,


-----

- When you request a service start using the Start/Stop page, the system creates a service agreement in the pending start
state.

- If you cancel a pending start before service is activated, the system automatically changes the state of the service
agreement to cancelled.

- When everything necessary to start service exists, the system automatically changes the state of the service agreement to
active.

- When you request a service stop using the Start/Stop page, the system changes the state of the stopped service agreement
to pending stop state.

- When everything necessary to stop service exists, the system automatically changes the state of the service agreement to
stopped.

- When a final payment is received and the stopped service agreement's balance becomes zero, the system automatically
changes the state of the service agreement to closed. The system can also close a service agreement as part of the writeoff processing.

- If the payment bounces, the system automatically changes the state of the service agreement to reactivated. And the
system will change it back to closed when the account's balance returns to zero.

- If a billable charge is interfaced into the system, the system automatically changes the state of the service agreement to
reactivated.

You may need to manually change a service agreement's state for the following reasons:

- If a service agreement was activated inadvertently, you may cancel it (and therefore logically remove it from the system)
after canceling all of its financial transactions. You do this by clicking the cancel button on the service agreement page.
You may also cancel an incorrect service agreement if the status transitions to pending stop or stopped before you have a
chance to correct the mistake.

- If you don't want to wait for the system to automatically activate a pending start service agreement, you may push the
activate button on the service agreement page. You might do this in order to create a bill for an impatient customer.

- If you don't want to wait for the system to automatically finalize a pending stop service agreement, you may push the
stop button on the service agreement page. You might do this in order to create a real time final bill for a customer.

- If you don't want to wait for the system to automatically close a stopped service agreement, you may push the close
button on the service agreement page.

- Sometimes a service agreement is closed or stopped by mistake. You can activate a stopped, closed, or reactivated
service agreement using the Reinstate SA button on the service agreement page. Using the Reinstate SA button retains
the current service's billing history.

**NOTE:**
**One time invoices (i.e., one-time billable charges) are interesting. One-time invoice service agreements follow the**
above lifecycle; it's just that they do it quickly. You see, when a one-time invoice service agreement is created, both
its start and stop dates are known (they are the invoice date). If you followed the above state transition discussion,
you'll understand that the system progresses these invoices from pending start to stopped when the service agreement is
activated.

###### Renewing Service Agreements

Some service agreement types (e.g., non-billed budgets) may allow or require renewal. If renewal is optional, a renewal date
may be specified when the service agreement is created. If renewal is required, you must specify a renewal date.

The SA renewal background process initiates the renewal for all active service agreements when the renewal date is reached
(i.e., the renewal date is on or before the process date). When a service agreement is renewed:


-----

- The SA renewal algorithm (specified on the SA type) is executed. The SA renewal algorithm can be used to customize
the processing required to renew an SA.

- If the SA renewal algorithm is successful, the renewal and expiration date (if calculated by the renewal algorithm) on the
service agreement are updated with the values returned from the renewal algorithm.

- If the renewal process is not successful, a To Do list entry (of type TD-SARN) is created for the account and service
agreement.

###### Expiring Service Agreements

Service agreements may specify an expiration date. Some service agreement types (e.g., Non-Billed Budgets) require an
expiration date. The SA expiration background process initiates the request to stop service for all active SAs when the
expiration date is reached (i.e. the expiration date is on or before the process date).

###### Service Agreement - Main Information

The Main page contains basic service agreement information. Open Menu > Customer Information > Service
**Agreement > Search to maintain this information.**

**Description of Page**

**SA (service agreement) Info and SA ID are displayed on every page. These values only appear after the service agreement**
exists on the database. The ID is a system assigned random number that stays with a service agreement for life. The SA
**Info is a concatenation of important details about the service agreement and its account.**

**NOTE:**
**Formatting may be performed by a plug-in. The contents of SA Info may be formatted by a plug-in algorithm on**
SA Type. Refer to the base package's C1-SAT-INFO for an example. If such an algorithm is not plugged-in on the SA
Type, the system looks for a corresponding algorithm on the installation record. Refer to the base package's C1-SAIINFO for an example. If you prefer different formatting logic, your system administrator should configure the system
appropriately.

**SA Status defines the state of the service agreement. The system typically changes the state of a service agreement behind-**
the-scenes. If you can't wait for the system, use one of the adjacent buttons:

- Click the Activate SA button to activate a Pending Start service agreement.

- Click the Cancel SA button to cancel a Pending Start or Active, Pending Stop or Stopped service agreement.

- Click the Initiate Stop button to populate the End Date and change the state of the service agreement to Pending Stop.

- Click the Stop SA button to stop a Pending Stop service agreement.

- Click the Close SA button to close a Stopped or Reactivated service agreement.

- Click the Reinstate SA button to reinstate a Closed, Reactivated, or Stopped service agreement to an Active service
agreement.

**FASTPATH:**
Refer to The Lifecycle of a Service Agreement for more information about SA Status.

If the quotation module is not turned off, a "real" service agreement can be created when aproposal service agreement is
accepted. If the service agreement you've displayed was created in such a way, information about the Proposal SA will
appear beneath SA Status.


-----

Enter the Account ID that is financially responsible for the service agreement. If you change a service agreement's Account
**ID, you are effectively transferring this service agreement (and its debt) to the new account.**

Indicate the CIS Division and SA Type. These fields are very important as they control numerous aspects of the service
agreement's behavior. These fields are gray when the status is not Pending Start.

**NOTE:** If the service agreement’s account’s CIS Division’s Restrict to Account CIS Division flag is set to Restricted,
the CIS Division is set to the account’s CIS Division and cannot be changed.

**FASTPATH:**
For more information about what the SA type controls, refer to Setting Up SA Types.

The Start Date defines when the financial relationship begins. The End Date defines when the financial relationship
terminates. If the end date is blank, the service agreement has not yet been terminated.

Use Maximum Bill Threshold if you want the system to generate a bill error when a bill segment is produced in batch that
exceeds a given value. These bill errors will appear on the standard billing queries and To Do lists. If, after reviewing the
high value bill segment, a user truly intends to send the bill out, they should regenerate the bill. Refer to How To Correct A
Bill Segment That's In Error for more information.

**NOTE:**
**Default note. The value of Maximum Bill Threshold defaults from the service agreement's SA type.**

If the SA Type has a special role of Bill Determinants Required, you must enter the Cutoff Time and Start Day Option
that is used on a bill determinants usage request.

- The Cutoff Time is entered in "legal time". This value defaults from either the start option or the installation record.

- For Start Day Option, you may choose Current Day or Previous Day. This value defaults from either the start option or
the installation record.

Use Customer Read to define if the customer reads their own meter. Valid values are: Yes, No.

Turn on Allow Estimates if it's OK for the billing process to use estimated usage from Oracle Utilities Meter Data
Management for this service agreement. If the SA type does not allow estimates, this field will be gray.

If you've set up the system to use start options, you can have the system default many fields by copying the terms from a
start option when service is started using either Start / Stop or the Order transaction. The Start Option field contains the last
start option whose field values were copied to the service agreement. If you need to change a service agreement's terms by
applying a different start option, you can. Refer to Changing A Start Option for a description of how to do this.

If the service agreement's rate uses premise-based characteristics for taxation and other purposes, Characteristic Premise
**ID defines the premise that supplies these characteristics. This field also defines the premise under which the service**
agreement's bill segments are classified and is used to identify where the service agreement's service is located on various
windows. This field is gray if the service agreement's SA type doesn't require a characteristic premise. For more information
about rates and their use of characteristics, refer toSetting Up Bill Factors.

**NOTE:**
**Selecting a characteristic premise. If the service agreement has service points, only premises associated with these**
service points may be selected as a Char Premise. If the service agreement doesn't have service points, any premise
may be selected.

Your conversion process will fill in Old Account ID for service agreements that were converted from your legacy CIS
system. The payment upload process uses this field to locate the accounts for payments that reference a legacy account
number.


-----

If the service agreement requires a total amount to bill, the amount is displayed. This field is typically only used on loan
or cash deposit service agreements. It holds either the loan amount or the desired cash deposit. If you increase this field's
value, the customer will be billed for any difference between the new amount and the total amount billed (and paid for) to
date. The label that appears for this field is defined on the SA type (on the Billing tab). We recommend that the system be
set up so that this label is very specific, for example:

- It should be called Cash Deposit Amount if the total amount to bill is for a deposit.

- It should be called Loan Amount if the total amount to bill is for a loan.

**Number of Payment Periods only appears for loan SA types. It displays the number of periods specified when the loan**
was first activated. (The number of payment periods may have been subsequently changed on Loan maintenance.)

If the service agreement uses a recurring charge, the current recurring charge amount is displayed. Transfer to the Service
Agreement - Recurring Charge to update this value. This field is not visible if the service agreement's SA type doesn't allow
recurring charges. The label that appears for this field is defined on the SA type (on the Billing tab). We recommend that the
system be set up so that this label is very specific, for example:

- It should contain Budget Amount if the recurring charge is for a budget.

- It should contain Installment Amount if the recurring charge is used for a deposit being paid in installments.

- It should contain Payment Amount if the recurring charge is used for a loan.

**SA Relationship ID contains the ID of the SA Relationship that is associated with a sub service agreement. This field is**
only visible on sub service agreements. Refer to Sub Service Agreements for more information.

**CIAC Review Date displays the last date that the Contributions In Aid of Construction (CIAC) review process ran for**
this service agreement. This field is only visible if the SA type indicates this is a CIAC service agreement. Refer to CIAC
Segmentation for more information on CIAC.

**Deposit Interest Calculated contains the last date the system applied interest. This field is only visible if the SA type has a**
special role of Cash Deposit.

The Scheduled Payment Autopay flag determines if the Non-Billed Budget scheduled payments are excluded from
automatic payment or included by automatic payment. If the account is not set up for automatic payment for the period that
covers the Non-Billed Budget, this flag cannot be set. This field is only visible if the SA has a special role of Non-Billed
Budget.

The NBB Recommendation Rule displays the description of the non-billed budget recommendation rule used for this SA.
This field is only visible if the SA has a special role of Non-Billed Budget.

**Expiration Date contains the date at which the service agreement is set to expire.**

**Renewal Date contains the date at which the service agreement is to be renewed. Renewal date is disabled if renewal is not**
allowed on the SA type.

**Debt Class indicates the debt class into which the service agreement's current balance is categorized by credit and**
collections. A service agreement's debt class is defined on its SA type. Refer to Different Collection Criteria For Different
Customers And Different Debt for more information about debt class.

**Current Balance indicates the amount the customer currently owes for the service.**

**Payoff Balance indicates the amount the customer would owe if they wanted to close the service agreement. This value is**
only displayed when it differs from current balance.

**FASTPATH:**
Refer to Current Amount versus Payoff Amount for more information.

The Days Old and Arrears Amount information shows how old the current balance is. This information will be blank if
the current balance is a credit.

**NOTE:**


-----

Information about debt balances by age is not applicable to open-item accounts.

This bottom of this page contains a tree that shows the various objects linked to the service agreement. You can use this
tree to both view high-level information about these objects and to transfer to the respective page in which an object is
maintained.

The topics that follow describe miscellaneous features on this page.

###### Changing A Start Option

If the service agreement is in the pending start state, you can use the Start/Stop - Pending SAs page to change the service
agreement's SA type and/or start option.

If the service agreement is in the active or pending stop states and if the SA type uses start options, a button appears on
Service Agreement - Main called Apply New Start Option. When clicked, the Apply New Start Option dialog box opens.

The fields in this dialog box allow you to define a Start Option whose terms should be copied to the service agreement
as of a given effective date ( Apply Start Option on). Because most terms on a service agreement are effective-dated,
it's important that you understand the following ramifications of applying a start option (note, we use the word "terms" to
generically reference any of the fields that can be defaulted from a start option):

- Terms are reused if Start Option contains the same value as defined in the service agreement. For example,

  - If the Start Option references the same rate as defined in the service agreement, a new rate record will NOT be
created.

  - If the Start Option references a contract rider that's currently defined in the service agreement, a new rider will NOT
be created.

- Terms that support explicit expiration (i.e., those with an end date) are expired if they are not referenced on the new
**start option. For example, if the service agreement has a rider that is not referenced on the new start option, it will be**
expired.

- Terms that support implicit expiration (i.e., those without an end date) are left unchanged if they are not referenced on
the new start option. For example, a service agreement characteristic that isn't referenced on the new start option will
NOT be modified when a new start option is applied.

**NOTE:**
**Only start options related to the service agreement's SA type can be used. It should be noted that only start options**
related to the service agreement's SA type can be specified. If the service agreement is in the pending start state, you
can change the service agreement's SA type on the Main tab or via Start/Stop - Pending SAs. If the service agreement is
active, you may not change its SA type.

When you click OK a warning window will appear that summarizes the changes that will be made to the service agreement.
After confirming what will be changed, click OK to change the service agreement's terms. The Start Option that is shown
on the Main tab will now reflect the start option whose terms were just applied.

###### The Impact of Proposal Service Agreements

If the quotation module is not turned off, you may display a proposal service agreement on Service Agreement - Main. This
section describes how Service Agreement - Main differs when a proposal service agreement is displayed.

The SA Status section is replaced with a section that shows the status of the proposal service agreement (proposal SA).


-----

**Proposal SA Status defines the state of the proposal service agreement. The Quote Maintenance transaction typically**
changes the status of a proposal SA when users accept, decline and cancel quote details. If you wish to change the status of
a proposal SA independent of this transaction, you can press one of the adjacent buttons

- Click the Activate button to change the status from Pending to Quotable. Note, you can set up the system to
automatically make newly created proposal SAs quotable by plugging in the appropriate Proposal SA Creation algorithm
on the SA's SA type.

- Click the Accept button to change the status from Quotable to Accepted. When you accept a proposal SA, you will be
asked to supply the Start Date of the real service agreement that will be created.

- Click the Decline button to change the status from Quotable to Declined. When you decline a proposal SA, you will be
asked to supply a Decline Reason.

- Click the Cancel button to change the status from Quotable to Canceled.

- Click the Reactivate button to return a Canceled or Declined proposal SA to the Quotable state.

**FASTPATH:**
Refer to Proposal SA State Transition for more information about ProposalSA Status.

If the proposal SA has been declined, the Decline Reason appears beneath Proposal SA Status. Refer to Accepting /
Declining Quote Details for more information.

It the proposal SA was changed after a quote detail was generated using the proposal SA's terms, a Remark appears
beneath Proposal SA Status highlighting such.

**NOTE:**
**Changing A Start Option. You can Apply A New Start Option on pending and quotable proposal SAs.**

If a real service agreement was created when the proposal SA was accepted, Real SA ID appears and contains the ID of the
real service agreement. Refer to Accepting / Declining Quote Details for more information.

###### Service Agreement - Rate Info

The rate info page contains the service agreement's rate and information needed by the rate to calculate the service
agreement's bill segments. This information is only displayed if the service agreement's SA type allows a rate.

Open Menu > Customer Information > Service Agreement > Search and navigate to the Rate Info page.

**Description of Page**

The Rate grid controls the rate used to calculate the service agreement's bill segments. Multiple rows will only exist if the
service agreement's Rate changes over time.

A service agreement's Rate is populated by the system when service is started. The method used to populate the initial Rate
depends on how service is started and whether you use start options:

- If the service agreement's SA type uses start options:

  - If the Order transaction is used to start service, the rate is populated using the start option associated with the package
that was selected by the user when the order was completed.

  - If Start/Stop is used to start service, the rate is populated using the start option selected by the user when service was
initiated.

- If the service agreement's SA type does not use start options, the SA type's default rate is populated on the service
agreement.


-----

Billing selects a single rate from the Rate grid when it calculates a bill segment for the service agreement. If multiple rates
are defined in this grid, the rate is selected based on the service agreement's SA type's Rate Selection Date. The following
fields display:

- **Effective Date is the date the rate becomes effective. The service agreement's start date defaults.**

- **Rate Schedule defines the rate used to calculate the service agreement's bill segments. Note, you can only choose rates**
defined as permissible on the service agreement's SA type; the permissible rates are shown in the adjacent tree.

**NOTE:**
**Possible override. If your service agreement is linked to a terms of service record, it is possible that the rate used by the**
system could get overridden by one referenced on the terms of service. If the rate is overridden by the TOS, the tree on
this page indicates the rate source.

The Contract Rider grid contains the contract riders that are in effect for the service agreement. This information is
defaulted when service is started using a start option (using the contract rider information defined on the start option). You
should only have to access this section if you need to fine-tune what the system defaults.

Billing uses this information when it calculates a bill segment for the service agreement if:

- The rate used to calculate the bill segment contains a calculation rule that references a bill factor.

- The referenced bill factor requires a contract rider to levy the associated charge.

If a Contract Rider does not exist or is not effective, the charge associated with the calculation rule is not applied to the
customer's bill.

To modify a contract rider linked to the service agreement, simply move to a field and change its value. To remove a
contract rider, click the - button. To add a new contract rider, click the + button and fill in the information for each field.
The following fields display:

- Use Start Date to define the date on which the contract rider becomes effective. The service agreement's start date
defaults.

- Use End Date to define the date on which the contract rider expires. This field need only be specified if the contract
rider expires on an explicit date.

- Use Bill Factor to define the type of rider. You may only reference Bill Factors designated as being applicable for
contract riders. Note, the Bill Factors linked to the rate that are marked with contract rider applicability are shown in the
adjacent tree under the Contract Rider node.

The Contract Values grid contains the contract values that are in effect for the service agreement. This information is
defaulted when service is started using the contract value information defined on the start option used to start service (if
any). You should only have to access this page if you need to fine-tune what the system defaults.

Billing uses this information when it calculates a bill segment for the service agreement if:

- The rate used to calculate the bill segment contains a calculation rule that references a bill factor.

- The referenced bill factor uses a contract value to define the amount charged.

The following fields display:

- Use Start Date to define the date on which the contract value becomes effective. The service agreement's start date
defaults.

- Use End Date to define the date on which the contract value expires. This field need only be specified if the value rider
expires on an explicit date.

- Use Bill Factor to define the type of value. You may only reference Bill Factors designated as allowing values in
contract terms. Note, the Bill Factors linked to the rate that are marked as allowing values in contract terms are shown in
the adjacent tree under the Contract Value node.

- Use Value to define contract value.


-----

**FASTPATH:**
For more information about contract values, refer to Defining General Bill Factor Information.

The Tax Exemptions section contains the taxes from which the service agreement is all or partially exempt.

Billing uses this information when it calculates a bill segment for the service agreement if:

- The rate used to calculate the bill segment contains a calculation rule that references a bill factor.

- The referenced bill factor can have tax exemptions that limit the amount of the charge.

If the bill factor doesn't have a tax exemption or there are none that are effective during the bill period, the tax is levied
in full. If the service agreement is exempt, the appropriate charge associated with the tax is calculated. We strongly
recommend using the "%T" substitution character in the Description on Bill on tax-exemptible calculation rules so that an
appropriate tax exemption message appears on the customer's bill.

The following fields display:

- Use Start Date to define the date on which the tax exemption becomes effective.

- Use End Date to define the date on which the tax exemption expires.

- Use Bill Factor to define the tax from which the service agreement is exempt. You may only reference bill factors
designated as being tax exemptible. Note, the Bill Factors linked to the rate that are marked as tax exemptible are shown
in the adjacent tree under the Tax Exemption node.

- Use Percent Exempt to define the customer tax exemption percent (e.g., 90 means the customer is 90% exempt and will
only pay 10% of the normal tax rate).

- Use Tax Exempt Type to specify the type of exemption.

- Use Tax Certification if the customer has a tax exemption certificate.

###### Rate Information Tree

The tree shows the service agreement's permissible rates and the related types of contract riders, contract values and tax
exemptions that are possible given these rates.

- The Permissible Rates node displays all the rate schedules associated with the service agreement's SA Type.

- The Effective Rate Schedule node indicates the rate schedule currently effective.

- The Contract Rider node displays the bill factors linked to the service agreement's rate(s) that may have contract riders

**Scenario page.**

**Description of Page**

This page is protected if the service agreement being displayed is not a proposal service agreement.

When a quote is generated for a proposal SA, the system creates a simulated bill segment for each billing scenario linked to
the proposal SA. Each simulated bill segment shows the prospect how much their bill would be if the pricing terms on the
proposal SA were applied to the billing scenario's consumption in the related time period.

**NOTE:**
**You should not have to enter this information from scratch. You can set up the system to automatically generate**
billing scenarios when a proposal SA is created. Refer to Proposal SAs Contain Billing Scenarios for the details.

The following information is defined for each billing scenario:

- **Start Date and End Date define the simulated bill segment's period.**

- The grid contains the consumption that will be priced during this period:

  - **Unit of Measure is the unit of measure of the service quantity.**

  - **TOU is the time-of-use code of the service quantity.**

  - **SQI is the service quantity identifier of the service quantity.**

  - **Initial Service Quantity is the initial quantity passed to the rate (and massaged by the rate's pre-processing**
calculation group(s), if any exist).

  - **Service Point ID is used if your rate uses pre-processing calculation groups that require characteristic values from the**
service point or premise. For example, the calculation rule that converts CCF to therms uses a bill factor to store the
conversion factor. This bill factor may have been configured to use characteristics on the service point / premise (e.g.,
the conversion factor may differ based on the storage location associated with the service point).

**FASTPATH:**
For more information about premises and their place in the "V", refer to Understanding The "V". For more information
about the relationships between premises, service points, meters and items, refer to An Illustration Of A Premise.

###### Premise - Main Information

The Premise page contains basic premise information. Open Menu > Customer Information > Premise > Search to
maintain this information.

**Description of Page**

Basic information about the Premise and the premise's unique identifier (i.e., the Premise ID) are displayed on every page.
These values only appear after the premise exists on the database. The ID is a system assigned random number that stays
with a premise for life.

**NOTE:**
**Formatting is performed by a plug-in. The basic information about a premise that appears at the top of this page**
(and on many other pages in the system) is controlled by a plug-in algorithm on the installation record. Refer to the
base package's premise format algorithm (PREM-INFO) for an example. If you prefer a different format, your system
administrator should configure the system appropriately.

Indicate the Premise Type to categorize the type of premise.

The address's constituent fields vary based on the Country. Please refer to the Country page for more information.

**NOTE:**
**Default note. A premise's state, city, county, division, characteristics, trend area and geographic data default from**
your postal default information. Refer to Setting Up Premise & Service Point Postal Defaults for more information. If
you change the premise's postal code, the system will default geographic values based on the new postal code.

Use CIS Division to define the jurisdiction in which the premise is located if the premise type allows CIS Division. This
defaults based on the Country and the Postal, but can be overridden here. If your implementation has set the Installation
Option Control By CIS Division flag, the values are restricted to the user’s CIS Division(s). See Users and CIS Division for
more information. The value is defaulted to user’s primary CIS Division, but that can be overridden by the postal defaults

The Validate button on the premise page will only be available if you have set the Allow Address Validation option type to
Y on the General System Configuration feature configuration. Once clicked, the Address Validation Script on the General
System Configuration feature configuration will be invoked to validate the entered address. Refer to Implementing Address
Validation for more information.

Indicate whether the address is a valid Mailing Address. Premises that are valid mailing addresses may be specified as the
mailing premise on an account. Refer to Account - Person Information for more information.

Use Landlord Agreement to define the landlord agreement that covers the premise, if any.

**NOTE:**
**Landlord reversion. When you specify a landlord agreement on a premise, you are telling the system that service**
associated with the premise's service points should be reverted to the landlord's account when a tenant stops service. The
system uses this information during the stop service process to automatically create pending start service agreement(s)
for the landlord.


-----

**Managing a large number of premises for the same landlord If the premise management module is not turned off,**
the premise management page helps you to manage the premises linked to the landlord.

If the premise management module is not turned off, you may reference a Parent Premise to include this premise in a
premise hierarchy.

At the bottom of this page is a tree that shows the various objects linked to the premise. You can use this tree to both view
high-level information about these objects and to transfer to the respective page in which an object is maintained.

###### Premise - Characteristics

The Characteristics page contains information that controls taxation and other rate options that differ based on geography.
Use Menu > Customer Information > Premise > Search and navigate to the Characteristics page.

**Description of Page**

Many charges that appear on bills associated with consumption at this premise are controlled by the premise's characteristic
values (e.g., the taxing city defines the city tax percent applied to the premise's consumption). Refer to An Illustration Of A
Bill Factor And Its Characteristics for more information.

Characteristics also matter if your rates were set up to convert measured consumption into some other unit of measure
before charges can be calculated (e.g., converting a cubic foot of gas to its therm value). Refer to All Calculation RuleBased Rates Share a Common Structure for more information about pre-processing calculation groups.

**NOTE:**
You can only choose characteristic types defined as permissible on the premise record. Refer to Setting Up
Characteristic Types & Their Values for more information.

The following fields display:

**Effective Date Indicate the effective date of the characteristic type and value. The effective date defaults from the**
Installation Record when you are adding a new premise. The effective date defaults to the current date when you are
changing an existing premise.

**Characteristic Type Indicate the type of characteristic.**

**Characteristic Value Indicate the value of the characteristic.**

**NOTE:**
**Default note. A premise's characteristics default from your postal default information. Refer to Setting Up Premise &**
Service Point Postal Defaults for more information. If you change the premise's postal code, the system will default
characteristic values based on the new postal code.

###### Premise - Miscellaneous

The Miscellaneous page contains information meter read controls and life support information related to the premise. Use
**Menu > Customer Information > Premise > Search and navigate to the Misc page.**

support / sensitive load equipment), None. If a value of LS/SL has been selected, define the type of equipment in Life
**Support / Sensitive Load Notes.**

**NOTE:**
**A person can also have life support / sensitive load information. If the equipment is personal (i.e., it travels with the**
person as they move from premise to premise), you should NOT specify the life support information on the premise.
Rather, transfer to Person - Main and specify life support information on the person.

**Alert and C&C. If the base package's C1-LSSL-PREM algorithm is enabled on the installation record, and life**
support / sensitive load information is specified, an alert will appear when the premise is displayed on control central.
In addition, if a premise has life support or sensitive load equipment, it is possible for a different credit & collection
severance process to be kicked off if the account associated with the premise has overdue debt. Refer to Designing Your
Severance Procedures for more information.

Enter the Time Zone in which the premise is located. This value defaults from your postal defaults.

The geographic information is used by Control Central to look for premises. The following fields display:

**Geographic Type Indicate the type of geographic data.**

**Geographic Value Specify the coordinate value. If the entered value must be in a specific format, a description of the**
required format is displayed adjacent. For example, if you see the format 99A 99A 99 9, you must enter 2 numbers,
followed by a letter, followed by a space, followed by 2 numbers, followed by a letter, followed by a space, followed by 2
numbers, followed by a space, followed by a single number.

**NOTE:**
**Formatting is performed by a plug-in. The format that is applied to a Geographic Value is controlled by the**
algorithm that is plugged in on the respective Geographic Type. If you prefer a different format, your system
administrator should configure this algorithm appropriately. Note, algorithms of this type will NOT convert the input
value into the relevant format (i.e., you must enter the information in the exact format dictated by the algorithm).

**Default note. A premise's geographic data defaults from your postal default information. Refer to Setting Up Premise**
& Service Point Postal Defaults for more information. If you change the premise's postal code, the system will default
geographic values based on the new postal code.

###### Premise - Alternate Address

**WARNING:**


-----

This tab only appears if you have enabled alternate addresses on the installation record. Refer to the description of the
Alternate Representation field under Installation - Mainfor more information.

This page is used when you have an alternate way to define a premise's address. This is typically used in countries that use
multiple character sets (e.g., the Main address is entered in Chinese, the Alternate Address is entered in English). When a
premise has an alternate address, both the main and alternate addresses can be used to search for a premise.

Open Menu > Customer Information > Premise > Search and navigate to the Alternate Address page to maintain this
information.

**Description of Page**

The remaining fields on the page are used to define the premise's alternate address.

The address's constituent fields vary based on the Country. Country is always protected on this page because a premise's
alternate address must be located in the same country as its main address. Please refer to the Country page for more
information about address constituents.

**NOTE:**
**Default note. An alternate address's state, city and county default from your postal default information. Refer to Setting**
Up Premise & Service Point Postal Defaults for more information.

The Swap Main / Alt Address button becomes enabled when you've entered an Alternate Address. When clicked, the
contents of the address on the Main tab are swapped with the Alternate Address.

###### Premise - Premise Portal

Select Menu > Customer Information > Premise and navigate to the Premise Portal page to view additional
information associated with a Premise.

Depending on your implementations requirements, you may define additional zones to appear on this Portal.

The contents of this section describe the zones that are available on this portal page.

**General Information**

**Premise ID, Premise Info are displayed.**

###### Maintaining Service Points

Refer to Maintaining Service Points in the Device Installation chapter for information about the Service Point zone and
maintaining service points.

Service point records contain information describing the services supplied to a premise.

The following methods list the various ways in which service points can be created:

- A service point can be added when a premise is created using the premise replicator.

- A service point can be added when an order is completed.

- A service point can be added using this transaction.

**FASTPATH:**


-----

For more information about service points and their place in the "V", refer to Understanding The "V". For more
information about the relationships between premises, service points, meters and items, refer to An Illustration Of A
Premise.

##### Dashboard Portal

The Dashboard is a portal that always appears on the Oracle Utilities Customer Care and Billing desktop. Its zones contain
tools and data that are useful regardless of the object being displayed.

**NOTE:**
**User configurable. Refer to Each User Can Customize Which Zones Appear for information about a user can configure**
which zones appear.

**Global context. The system automatically refreshes the values saved in global context with information about the**
object that appears in Object Display Area. Various zones available in the dashboard portal have been designed to
display data related to a person id, account id or premise id, which are populated by the base global context algorithm
C1-GLBL-CTXT.

The contents of this section describe the zones that are available on this portal.

**NOTE:**
**Other zones exist. The zones described below are unique to Oracle Utilities Customer Care and Billing. Please see Core**
Dashboard Zones for a description of other zones that can appear on the dashboard.

###### Current Context Zone

The Current Context Zone contains basic information about the customer on which you are working.

A maximum of six rows may appear:

- The first row contains a person context menu and the person's name. You can click on the person's name to transfer to
the Person - Main page. Note, the person's name is formatted by a plug-in algorithm on the installation record. Refer to
the base package's name format algorithm (PERS-INFO) for an example. If you prefer different formatting logic, your
system administrator should configure the system appropriately.

- The second row contains an account context menu and the account's:

  - ID and check digit

  - The primary name of the main customer

  - Customer class

- The third row contains a premise context menu and the premise's address and premise type. Note, the address
information is formatted by a plug-in algorithm on the installation record. Refer to the base package's premise format
algorithm (PREM-INFO) for an example. If you prefer a different format, your system administrator should configure
the system appropriately.

- The fourth row contains a service point context menu and the service point’s information; including:

  - Premise address

  - Service point type

  - Measurement cycle and route


-----

  - Status of the service point

- The fifth row contains a device context menu and the device’s information; including:

  - Badge number

  - Device type

  - Device installation date/time

  - Status of the device

- The last row contains a measuring component context menu and the measuring component’s information; including:

  - The associated device’s badge number

  - Measuring component type

**NOTE:** If a premise has multiple service points, only one will be displayed in the Current Context Zone.

###### Customer Contact Zone

The Customer Contact Zone has three purposes:

- It shows the age of the Last customer contact associated with the person displayed in the Current Context zone. The
word Today is shown if the last contact was on the current date. The word Yesterday is shown if the last contact was on
the current date - 1 day. If neither is applicable, the number of days old is shown.

- It shows the name of the person who added this contact.

- It greatly simplifies the addition of a new customer contact. To add a new contact, simply select the Type of customer
contact, enter a brief Comment, and press the Add Contact button.

- After the contact is added, you can click the hyperlink in the Last area to go to the newly added contact where you can
set up reminders or indicate the contact should remain open until future resolution.

###### Financial Information Dashboard Zone

The Financial Zone that appears on the dashboard contains the same information that is described in the Financial
Information Zone on the account information portal.

###### Alert Dashboard Zone

The Alert Zone that appears on the dashboard contains the same information that is described in the Alert Zone on the
account information portal.

###### Customer Context Zone

Along with the Premise Context Zone, the Customer Context Zone is an alternative to the Current Context Zone. It contains
basic information about the customer on which you are working. When a person or account is in context, the following
information appears:

- Customer Name

- Primary Person Identifier


-----

- Account ID. When the person in context is the main customer on multiple accounts, this will appear as a drop down,
allowing for selection and switching between these accounts in context.

- Current Balance

- Aged Debt Bar. If the account's Current Balance is greater than zero, a colored bar is displayed adjacent. This bar
provides information about the age of the account's debt.

- CIS Division. This appears only when multiple divisions exist.

- Customer Class

- Related Financially Responsible Persons

**NOTE:** The base package delivers this zone configured on the Dashboard Portal but with the Display turned off by
default. To enable the Customer Context zone, navigate to your User - Portal Preferences, open the Dashboard portal
settings and turn on the Display option for the Customer Context zone.

###### Premise Context Zone

Along with the Customer Context Zone, the Premise Context Zone is an alternative to the Current Context Zone.

The zone contains a tree that shows the various objects linked to the premise in context as well as any additional premise(s)
associated to the account in context. You can use this tree to both view high-level information about these objects and to
transfer to the respective page in which an object is maintained.

**NOTE:** Refer to the C1-PremiseTree tree definition for more information about the premise tree node definitions and
hierarchy.

**Moving Service options are used to initiate start, stop, or transfer service requests.**

**NOTE:** The base package delivers this zone configured on the Dashboard Portal but with the Display turned off by
default. To enable the Premise Context zone, navigate to your User - Portal Preferences, open the Dashboard portal
settings and turn on the Display option for the Premise Context zone.

##### Setting Up Bill Print Groups

Bill print groups allow you to categorize an account's service agreements into groups for bill print purposes.

**NOTE:**
**Bill print groups are optional. Typically, only accounts with many SAs will use bill print groups because the**
standard bill print priority is sufficient for accounts with a limited number of SAs. Refer to SA Type - Billing for more
information about the standard bill print priority.

Let's use an example to clarify the bill print group concept. Consider a local government's account. This account would have
many service agreements (some for the police department, others for the court system, others for the department of public
works, etc.).

If you don't create a bill print group for this customer, their bill segments will be printed in the order dictated by each
segment's service agreement's SA type's bill print priority. If you create a bill print group for this customer, you can define
the customer's desired categories (e.g., police, courts, DPW, etc.) and then link each of the account's SAs to the appropriate
category.

**NOTE:**


-----

**Nomenclature. We refer to the categories under a bill print group as "subgroups". A bill print group can have an**
unlimited number of subgroups. When you create a subgroup, you define its relative bill print priority and the associated
verbiage to print on the bill (assuming you print information about the subgroup on the bill).

We'd like to highlight the following characteristics of bill print groups:

- A bill print group is associated with a specific account. If multiple customers have the exact categorization preferences,
you will have to set up multiple bill print groups.

- Over time, a customer could have many bill print groups. This would happen if a customer's bill categorization
preferences change over time. We'd like to stress that while an account can have multiple bill print groups, only one will
be used by the bill print process (the one effective on the bill date).

- Bill print groups only affect printed bills. Bill print groups do not affect the order in which service agreements appear on
the bill maintenance transaction.

- If new service agreements are added after a bill print group is set up for an account, they will not be linked to a subgroup.
If you neglect to link the new service agreements to one of the bill print group's subgroups they will be printed under the
"default" subgroup (every bill print group must have one default subgroup to cater for this situation).

**WARNING:**
While the system supports the definition of bill print groups and the categorization of an account's service agreements
into the various subgroups, the base package's bill print extract does NOT take advantage of this information.

The topics in this section describe how to set up a bill print group and how to link an account's service agreements to its
subgroups.

###### Bill Print Group - Main

Open Menu > Customer Information > Bill Print Group > Search to maintain an account's bill print group and
subgroups. After defining this information, transfer to the SA Sub Group page to link the account's service agreements to
the subgroups.

**Description of Page**

The Bill Print Group ID is displayed on every page. This value only appears after the bill print group exists on the
database. The ID is a system-assigned random number that stays with a bill print group for life.

Enter the Account ID associated with the bill print group.

Use Effective Date to define when the bill print group is effective for the account. This date is important as it allows a
customer to change their preferences over time. For example, if the customer wants to change the number of subgroups on a
given date, you would simply add a new bill print group effective on this date and then define the new subgroups (and link
each service agreement to one of the subgroups).

Use Status to define if the bill print group is Active or Inactive. You would only use the Inactive value if the bill print group
is no longer needed (as there is no delete action on this transaction).

Enter a brief Description of the bill print group.

Use Comments to describe anything special about the bill print group.

The grid contains the bill print group's subgroups. The following information should be defined for each subgroup:

- **Bill Print Sub Group. This is the unique identifier of the bill print subgroup.**

- **Sub Group Bill Print Priority. This is the relative print priority of the subgroup in respect of the other subgroups.**


-----

- **Use as Default. Turn on this switch for the default sub group. A bill print group must have one and only one default**
subgroup. The default group is used by the bill print process if it detects a service agreement that is not linked to a
subgroup (it links this service agreement to the default subgroup).

- **Sub Group Description. This is a brief description of the subgroup.**

- **Description on Bill. This is the verbiage that will print on the bill (assuming you print something on your bills for the**
subgroup).

After defining the bill print group's subgroups, navigate to the SA Sub Group tab to link the account's service agreements
to the subgroups.

###### Bill Print Group - SA Sub Group

This page is used to link the account's service agreements to one of the bill print group's subgroups.

Open Menu > Customer Information > Bill Print Group > Search and navigate to the SA Sub Group page to maintain
this information.

**Description of Page**

The Bill Print Group's ID, Account ID and Effective Date are displayed at the top of the page.

The filters control the service agreements that appear in the SAs in Bill Print Group grid. The following points describe the
various options:

- Use the SA Filter to define the types of service agreements that appear in the grid. The following options are available:

  - Address. Use this option to restrict service agreements to those linked to service points associated with a given
**Address, City and/or Postal code. Note, you can specify any combination of these fields.**

  - All. Use this option if you do not wish to restrict service agreements based on service agreement attributes.

  - Bill Print Sub Group. Use this option to restrict service agreements to those that are linked to a given Bill Print Sub
**Group.**

  - Geographic Type. Use this option to restrict service agreements to those linked to service points associated with a
given Geo Type and Value.

  - SA Type. Use this option to restrict service agreements to those linked to a given CIS Division and SA Type.

- Use Status Filter to restrict the service agreements based on their status. The following options are available:

  - All. This option shows all service agreements regardless of status.

  - Refer to Service Agreement Lifecycle for the various status values.

Don't forget to click the search button after changing the filters.

The SAs in Bill Print Group contains an entry for every non-cancelled service agreement linked to the account that is
linked to one of the bill print group's subgroups. The following information appears in the grid:

- Use Bill Print Sub Group to define the subgroup associated with the service agreement.

- Use Sequence when there is more than one service agreement in the subgroup. The sequence controls the order in which
the service agreement's financial information appears on the bill.

- The SA Information column provides a brief description of the service agreement.

- The Service Agreement column contains the unique identifier of the service agreement.

- The Premise Information column contains the characteristic premise associated with the bill segment's service
agreement.

The next set of filters control the service agreements that appear in the SAs Not in Bill Print Group grid. The following
points describe the various options:


-----

- Use the SA Filter to define the types of service agreements that appear in the grid. The following options are available:

  - Address. Use this option to restrict service agreements to those linked to service points associated with a given
**Address, City and/or Postal code. Note, you can specify any combination of these fields.**

  - All. Use this option if you do not wish to restrict service agreements based on service agreement attributes.

  - Geographic Type. Use this option to restrict service agreements to those linked to service points associated with a
given Geo Type and Value.

  - SA Type. Use this option to restrict service agreements to those linked to a given CIS Division and SA Type.

- Use Status Filter to restrict the service agreements based on their status. The following options are available:

  - All. This option shows all service agreements regardless of status.

  - Refer to Service Agreement Lifecycle for the various status values.

Don't forget to click the search button after changing the filters.

The SAs Not in Bill Print Group contains an entry for every non-cancelled service agreement linked to the account that is
NOT linked to one of the bill print group's subgroups. The following information appears in the grid:

- Use Bill Print Sub Group to define the subgroup associated with the service agreement.

- Use Sequence when there is more than one service agreement in the subgroup. The sequence controls the order in which
the service agreement's financial information appears on the bill.

- The SA Information column provides a brief description of the service agreement.

- The Service Agreement column contains the unique identifier of the service agreement.

- The Premise Information column contains the characteristic premise associated with the bill segment's service
agreement.

##### Landlord Reversion

Landlord reversion occurs when a landlord would like to have service reverted to their name when a tenant moves out. The
landlord defines their reversion preferences using a landlord agreement.

- A landlord's preferences can differ for each type of service. For example, you can indicate that a specific landlord always
wants electric and gas service reverted to their account when a tenant stops service. However, they do not want water
service to revert.

- A landlord's preferences can also be seasonal. For example, you can indicate water service should only revert to the
landlord's account during the winter.

The account to use for the reversion of service is defined on the landlord agreement.

Assuming that you have plugged-in a landlord reversion algorithm on SA type, the system uses the information defined on
landlord agreement to create a pending start service agreement(s) for the landlord when service for the existing tenant is
stopped.

The following examples illustrate how your organization's landlord reversion algorithm might handle various scenarios for a
premise that defines a landlord agreement that indicates service should be reverted:

- When the existing customer calls to stop service and no new customer is scheduled to move in, a pending start service
agreement is created for the landlord.

- When a new customer calls in to start service

  - If the start date matches the outgoing customer's start date, the pending start service agreement for the landlord is
canceled


-----

  - If the start date is earlier than the outgoing customer's stop date, the pending start service agreement for the landlord is
canceled and the stop date of the outgoing customer is changed to match the new date

  - If the start date is later than the outgoing customer's stop date, the pending start service agreement for the landlord is
updated with a stop date that matches the new customer's start date

- If changes are made to start or stop dates for the tenants' service agreements, a service agreement for the landlord may
need to be created or canceled

  - If the change in dates causes a gap in service that did not exist before, a landlord service agreement is created to cover
the gap

  - If the change in dates means that the tenants are now starting and stopping on the same date (and there used to be a
gap), a landlord service agreement is canceled

- If the new customer cancels their pending stop, a landlord service agreement is created (if one did not exist) or the
landlord SA's stop date is removed (if the new customer's start date resulted in a gap that was being covered by the
landlord.

###### Setting Up Landlord Agreements

The landlord agreement page is used to maintain a landlord's service reversion preferences.

**NOTE:**
**A landlord could have many landlord agreements. A landlord will have at least one landlord agreement. However,**
if the landlord has different service reversion preferences for different properties, you can create multiple landlord
agreements - one for each set of preferences. After a landlord's reversion preferences have been defined, link the
landlord agreement record to the respective premises.

Use Menu > Customer Information > Landlord Agreement > Search to maintain a Landlord Agreement.

**Description of Page**

**Landlord and Landlord ID only appear after the landlord is added to the database. Landlord ID is a system-assigned**
random number that stays with the landlord agreement for life. Landlord is the description of the landlord agreement.

If the premise management module is not turned off, a message is displayed indicating the number of premises linked
to this landlord. Clicking the hyperlink message text transfers you to the premise management page, which helps you to
manage the premises linked to the landlord.

Enter a Description of the landlord agreement.

Use Account ID to define the account to use when service is reverted to the landlord. This should be one of the landlord's
accounts.

The grid that follows contains one row for each type of service to be reverted to the landlord's account. Any service point
whose service type is not referenced in this scroll will NOT revert to the landlord's account when a tenant stops service. For
each row define the following:

- **Service Type defines the type of service point that will revert to the landlord's account when a tenant stops service. Note,**
a service point inherits its service type from its SP Type.

- Turn on Seasonal if the service should only revert to the landlords account during a specific season of the year. When
turned on, you must define the Start Month/Day and the End Month/Day of the effective season.

**NOTE:**


-----

The month and day must be entered in the format MM/DD. For example, if a season starts on March 1, you must enter
the value as 03/01.

##### Using The Premise Replicator

You use the premise replicator to create many copies of a premise and its service points.

Perform the following steps to replicate a premise:

- Add a premise.

- Add one or more service points to the premise.

- Use the premise replicator to create copies of the premise and its service points.

The topics in this section describe how to use the premise replicator.

###### Premise Replicator - Main Information

You use this page to create many copies of a given premise and its service points.

**WARNING:**
The system warns you if you attempt to create. However, this is just a warning as you may want to generate similar
premises and then update them with, for example, a unique apartment number on Premise - Main Information.

Use Menu > Customer Information > Premise Replicator to open this page.

**Description of Page**

Choose the Premise that serves as the template premise.

**NOTE:**
**Recommendation. Carefully verify the template premise using the other pages in this page before you save the**
replicated premises. After you save the replicated premises, any corrections could prove time consuming.

The two sections at the top of the page determine the number of replica premises to be created and the address information
that will be set up for each premise. The left section is used to define how the system will create the part of the address that
is different for each replica premise. The right section defines the parts of the address that will be the same for each replica
premise.

In the left section:

Use the Replicate option to control how the position of the replicated number in the first address line:

- Choose Street Number if the replicated number should prefix the Base value in the first address line of the premise. For
example, if you have a Start # of 1020 and a Base value of Main St and you choose the Street Number option, the first
replicated premise will be 1020 Main St.

- Choose Apartment Number if the replicated number should suffix the Base value in the first address line of the premise.
For example, if you have a Start # of 1020 and a Base value of 101 Main St, Apt. and you choose the Apartment
Number option, the first replicated premise will be 101 Main St, Apt. 1020 .

Indicate the Number Of Premises you wish to create.


-----

Use Base to define the information that will appear at the end of the first address line on each of the replicated premises.
Use Start # to define the number assigned to the first copy of the premise. Use Increment to define the value to increment
successive numbers by. The first and last address lines to be created by the replicator are displayed below.

For example, if the first address you want to create is 101 Derby St, and the last address is 199 Derby and you want to do
the odd numbered side of the street, you'd enter the following parameters:

Number of Premises would be 50

Address Suffix would be Derby St

Start From would be 101

Increment by would be 2

The right section displays the rest of the address information that will be copied onto each replicated premise. This
information is defaulted from the template premise that you selected. The Address 1 field is not shown because you define
the information to be entered there in the previous section, as explained above. The remaining fields, however, may be
edited if so desired.

After entering the parameters, click the Replicate button to generate your new premises. You can use the sections at the
bottom of the page to view the premises that will be created when you click save. The left section will show how Address
Line 1 will look on the first 10 premises. If you are creating more than 10 premises, the right section will show how Address
Line 1 will look on the last 10 premises. If everything looks clean, click save.

###### Premise Replicator - Premise

The Premise page is a display only page provided to let you confirm that the premise you selected on the add dialog is the
one to be used as the template by the replicator. Use Menu > Customer Information > Premise Replicator and navigate
to the Premise page.

**Description of Page**

This is a display only page that displays key information about the premise being replicated.

###### Premise Replicator - Premise SPs

This is a display only page provided to let you confirm that the premise you selected on the add dialog is the one to be used
as the template by the replicator. Use Menu > Customer Information > Premise Replicator and navigate to the Premise
**SPs page.**

**Description of Page**

This is a display only page that displays the details about the template premise's service points.

##### Start/Stop

The topics in this section describe how to start and stop service.

**WARNING:**
Please see Order versus Start/Stop for a discussion of the pros and cons of using the order transaction versus the start/
stop transaction to start service.


-----

###### The Big Picture Of Starting Service

Almost all requests to start service involve a conversation between a customer and a customer service representative (CSR).
During this conversation, the following is defined:

- WHO will pay for the service (i.e., the account).

- WHERE the service is consumed (i.e., the premise). Note, this is only required for premise-oriented services.

- WHEN the service is requested (i.e., the start date).

- WHAT TYPE of service is desired (i.e., the service agreement and service points).

- HOW MUCH will be paid for the service (i.e., the rate and contract riders).

After the conversation is complete, one or more service agreements in the state of pending start will exist. If the service
agreement uses service points, field activities may also be created.

In this section, we provide background information about the start process. For information about the page used to start
service, refer to Start Stop Maintenance.

###### The Lifecycle Of A Pending Start Service Agreement

When you request a new service for a customer, a pending start service agreement is created. The following diagram
illustrates the lifecycle of a typical pending start service agreement:

The above diagram is referenced in the topics that follow.


-----

###### Starting Service and Field Activities

When you initiate a request to start service, the system creates a service agreement in the state of pending start. If the
service agreement is service point-oriented, pending field activity requests necessary to start will be created at some point
prior to the service agreement being activated. The question is when? The contents of this section provide information about
when they are created and what types of activities are created.

**FASTPATH:**
When you enable the Control Central alert algorithm, C1-PEND-STRT, an alert displays when there is a pending start
service agreement linked to the account. This algorithm is plugged-in on the installation record.

###### What Type Of Start Field Activities Are Created

The type of customer event (such as, start service, stop service, and cut for non-payment) dictate the type of field activity
request generated. If you’ve setup your system properly, the system creates the appropriate orchestration activity for the
field activity request, based on the type of service point, state of the service (such as, disconnected-no meter and connectmeter installed) at the service point, state and capabilities of the device;. You shouldn’t have to be aware of field activity
requests and orchestration activities.

In addition to being linked to the service points, these field activity requests are also linked to the service agreement /
service point relationship so that the system can automatically activate the service agreement when the field activity
requests are complete.

**NOTE:**
**Back-to-Back. We use the term back-to-back to describe the situation when a single field activity supports both the**
stop and start service requests. The fieldwork algorithm delivered with the base package sets up a back-to-back situation
by default when it is aware of both the start AND stop customers at a premise.

**FASTPATH:**
For more information about the field activities associated with your SP types, refer to Setting Up Field Activity Type
Profiles. Refer to The System Activates Most Service Agreements Behind-The-Scenes for information about how the
system monitors field activities linked to a service agreement.

###### When Start Field Activities Are Created

Field activity requests will be created when the pending start service agreement is created if the following conditions are
true:

- The Create Field Activity Start Stop switch is enabled on the installation record. Refer to Installation Options - Main for
more information.

- The appropriate create fieldwork creation algorithm is defined on the service agreement's SA type. Refer to SA Type Algorithms for more information.

If the Create Field Activity Start Stop switch is NOT enabled on the installation record, field activity requests will NOT be
created when the pending start is saved. Rather, a background process (PSASPM) creates the field activity requests shortly
before the start date. The number of days before the start date on which field activity requests will be created is defined on
the service agreement's SA type's fieldwork creation algorithm.


-----

**NOTE:**
**A fail safe. If any person or process attempts to activate a pending start service agreement and neither of the above**
events has taken place, field activities will be created when the user attempts to activate the pending start. The creation
of the field activities will prevent the service agreement from being activated as described under The System Activates
Most Service Agreements Behind The Scenes.

**WARNING:**
Field activity requests will only be created if you have defined the appropriate field work creation algorithm on the
service agreement's SA type. The algorithm that is supplied with the base package checks if the service agreement /
service point already has a start field activity request, if so, field activity requests will not be created (the field work has
already been initiated).

###### Activating Pending Starts

When you initiate a request to start service, the system initiates a service agreement in the state of pending start. A pending
start service agreement remains in this state until everything necessary to start service is defined in the system. At that time,
the service agreement can be activated.

###### What Is Necessary To Start Service?

The service agreement's SA type defines what is necessary to start service:

- For SA types that have service points, all field activity requests linked to the service point must be complete before the
service agreement can be activated.

- For SA types that don't have service points (e.g., charitable donations, deposits, one-time charges), everything necessary
to activate the service agreement is defined when you initiate the request to start service. These types of service
agreements can be activated immediately.

###### The System Activates Most Service Agreements Behind-The-Scenes

Service agreements are activated by one of the following methods:

- The SA activation background process (SAACT or C1-ACTSA) automatically activates pending start service agreements
once it detects that everything necessary to start service is defined in the system. This is the most common method for
activating service agreements. This process runs as often as your organization desires (but it should run at least daily).

**NOTE:**
**Sub SAs are not handled by the SA activation background process. If your organization uses the SA relationship**
functionality and you have service providers that necessitate sub service agreements, you should be aware that the
SA activation background process only activates normal and master SAs; sub SAs are activated by the analyze SA
relationships background process (described in the next bullet point).

- If your organization uses the SA relationship functionality and you have service providers that necessitate sub service
agreements, the analyze SA relationships background process (ANLYZSAR) automatically activates pending start sub
SAs if their master SA is active.

- You can automatically activate a service agreement when it's created if you plug-in an SA creation algorithm of type
SACR-AT on the SA type. Because everything necessary to start service must be defined in the system before a


-----

service agreement can be activated, this method only works for SA types that don't have service points (e.g., charitable
donations, deposits, one-time charges, etc.). If this algorithm is not plugged in on an SA type, service agreements of that
type are activated by the SA activation background process or manually.

- You can activate a service agreement manually (assuming everything that's necessary to activate service is in place).
Simply open Service Agreement - Main and click the Activate SA button. This is only necessary if you do not want to
wait until the SA activation background process next runs.

###### What Happens At Activation Time?

When a service agreement is activated, the following takes place:

- The service agreement's state is changed from pending start to active.

- If the account's bill cycle is not protected and the service agreement has a metered service point, the bill cycle will be
changed to reflect the service point's measurement cycle’s bill cycle.

- If the account's mailing premise is not protected and the service agreement has a service point whose premise is a
mailing premise, the mailing premise is changed to reflect the service point's premise.

- If the account's division is not protected, the division is changed to reflect the service agreement's SA type's division.

- If there is a start adjustment defined on the service agreement's start option, an adjustment is levied.

- The main customer's billing address is changed to reflect the value specified on the Start/Stop page (and this may involve
changing the main customer's override mailing address on their person record).

###### What Happens After A SA Is Started?

**FASTPATH:**
Refer to The Lifecycle Of A Service Agreement for more information about a service agreement's lifecycle.

###### The Big Picture Of Stopping Service

To stop service you must define:

- WHO pays for the service (i.e., the account).

- WHEN service should stop (i.e., the stop start date).

- WHAT services to stop (i.e., the premise or specific service agreements).

After the above is defined in the system, the state of one or more service agreements will be changed to pending stop. If the
service agreement uses service points, field activities may also be created.

In this section, we provide background information about the stop process. For information about the page used to stop
service, refer to Start Stop Maintenance.

###### The Lifecycle Of A Pending Stop Service Agreement

When you request to stop service for a customer, the status of an existing service agreement becomes pending stop. The
following diagram illustrates the lifecycle of a typical pending stop service agreement:


-----

The above diagram is referenced in the topics that follow.

###### Stopping Service and Field Activities

When you initiate a request to stop service, the system changes the service agreement to the state of pending stop. If the
service agreement is service point-oriented, pending field activity requests necessary to stop will be created at some point
prior to the service agreement being stopped. The question is when? The contents of this section provide information about
when they are created and what types of activities are created.

###### What Type Of Stop Field Activities Are Created

The type of customer event (such as, start service, stop service and cut for non-payment) dictate the type of field activity
request. If you’ve setup your system properly, the system creates the appropriate orchestration activity for the field activity
request, based on the type of service point, state of the service (such as, disconnected-no meter and connect-meter installed)
at the service point, state and capabilities of the device. You shouldn’t have to be aware of field activity requests and
orchestration activities.

In addition to being linked to the service points, these field activity requests are also linked to the service agreement /
service point relationship so that the system can automatically stop the service agreement when the field activities are
complete.

**NOTE:**
**Back-to-Back. We use the term back-to-back to describe the situation when a single field activity supports both the**
stop and start service requests. The fieldwork algorithm delivered with the base package sets up a back-to-back situation
by default when it is aware of both the start and stop customers at a premise.


-----

**FASTPATH:**
For more information about the field activity requests associated with your SP types, refer to Setting Up Field Activity
Type Profiles. Refer to The System Finalizes Most Service Agreements Behind-The-Scenes for information about how
the system monitors field activity requests linked to a service agreement.

###### When Stop Field Activities Are Created

Field activity requests will be created when the pending stop service agreement is recorded when the following conditions
are true:

- The Create Field Activity Start Stop switch is enabled on the installation record. Refer to Installation Options - System
for more information.

- The appropriate create fieldwork creation algorithm is defined on the service agreement's SA type. Refer to SA Type Algorithms for more information.

If the Create Field Activity Start Stop switch is NOT enabled on the installation record, field activity requests will NOT be
created when the pending stop is saved. Rather, a background process (PSASPM) creates the field activity requests shortly
before the stop date. The number of days before the stop date on which field activities will be created is defined on the
service agreement's SA type's fieldwork creation algorithm.

**NOTE:**
**More information about the Create Field Activity Start Stop switch on the installation record. When this switch**
is on (and the user doesn't override it), pending field activity requests will be created when a start or stop is recorded (as
opposed to shortly before the start/stop date).

**A fail safe. If any person or process attempts to finalize a pending stop service agreement and neither of the above**
events has taken place, field activity requests will be created when the user attempts to finalize the pending stop. The
creation of the field activity requests will prevent the service agreement from being stopped as described under The
System Finalizes Most Service Agreements Behind The Scenes.

**WARNING:**
Field activity requests will only be created if you have defined the appropriate field work creation algorithm on the
service agreement's SA type. The algorithm that is supplied with the base package checks if the service agreement /
service point already has a stop field activity request, if so, field activity requests will not be created (the field work has
already been initiated).

###### Finalizing Pending Stops

When you initiate a request to stop service, the system changes the service agreement's state to pending stop. A pending
stop service agreement remains in this state until everything necessary to stop service is defined in the system. At that time,
the system automatically changes the state of the service agreement to stopped, and at that time the service agreement can
be final billed.

So, how does the system know that "everything necessary" is in the system? In this section we provide the answer and
explain the many other things that may take place at pending stop finalization.

###### The System Finalizes Most Service Agreements Behind-The-Scenes


-----

The SA activation background process (SAACT or C1-STPSA) finalizes a pending stop service agreement when everything
necessary is in place. The service agreement's SA Type defines what's necessary:

- For SA Types that don't have service points (e.g., charitable donations, deposits, third party billing), everything
necessary to finalize the service agreement is defined when you initiate the request to stop service. These types of service
agreements can be finalized immediately.

- For SA Types that have service points, all field activity requests linked to the service point must be complete.

When the SA activation background process detects that everything necessary to stop service is in place, it automatically
stops the service agreement. This process runs as often as your organization desires (but it should run at least daily).

**NOTE:**
**Sub SAs are not handled by the SA activation background process. If your organization uses the SA relationship**
functionality and you have service providers that necessitate sub service agreements, you should be aware that the SA
activation background process only stops normal and master SAs; sub SAs are stopped by the analyze SA relationships
background process.

You can stop a service agreement real-time (assuming everything that's necessary to stop service is in place). Simply open
Service Agreement - Main and click the Stop button.

###### What Happens At Finalization Time?

When a service agreement is finalized, the following takes place:

- If the service agreement's SA type has a SA Stop algorithm, the algorithm is executed.

- If the service agreement is for a non-billed budget (i.e., the SA type has a special role of Non-billed Budget ), the system
removes all covered SAs from the Non-Billed Budget. Refer to Stopping Non-Billed Budgets for more information.

- If the service agreement is covered by a non-billed budget, the SA is removed from the Non-Billed Budget. Refer to
Stopping a Covered SA for more information.

- When the last active service agreement covered by a non-billed budget is stopped, the Non-Billed Budget will be stopped
(i.e., its state will be changed from active to pending stop ).

- The service agreement's state will be changed from pending stop to stopped.

- If the service agreement has an active severance process, the process and its severance events will be canceled.

- If the service agreement is linked to an active collection process, the service agreement is "removed" from the collection
process. If the collection process has no other active service agreements, it is canceled.

- When the last service agreement linked to an account is stopped, the account's bill cycle will be changed so that the
account will be final billed when billing next executes. The system selects the latest open bill cycle where the Freeze
and Complete switch value matches the value of the Freeze and Complete switch of the account's current bill cycle. In
addition, the account's protect bill cycle flag is set to No so that the next time this account starts service, its bill cycle will
be set based on the new service point's service cycle.

- The main customer's billing address will be changed to reflect the value specified on the Start/Stop page (and this may
involve changing the main customer's override mailing address on their person record).

- If the service agreement is for a deposit (i.e., the SA type has a special role of Cash Deposit ), the system calculates
interest through the stop date. In addition, the SA's current balance is synchronized with its payoff balance (using the
sync adjustment code defined on the service agreement's SA type).

- When the last active service agreement governed by a deposit class is stopped, all active deposit service agreements
governed by the same deposit class will be stopped (i.e., their state will be changed from active to pending stop ). These
pending stop deposit service agreement will then be stopped (as per the above points).


-----

- When a service agreement is stopped, the system automatically cancels the budget. Refer to Canceling A Budget for
more information.

###### What Happens After A Service Agreement Is Stopped?

**FASTPATH:**
Refer to The Lifecycle Of A Service Agreement for more information about a service agreement's lifecycle.

###### Start/Stop Maintenance

You use the start/stop page to both start and stop service.

This page handles a variety of scenarios, including:

- Starting some or all services at a premise. Note, the system will automatically stop the existing customer when you
indicate a new customer is starting.

- Stopping some or all services at a premise. Note, the system will automatically revert service to a landlord's account
when you indicate a tenant is stopping.

- Starting non-premise-oriented services.

- Stopping non-premise-oriented services.

- Changing the mailing address associated with the account's main customer.

**FASTPATH:**
Refer to The Big Picture Of Starting Service for more information about starting service. Refer to The Big Picture Of
Stopping Service for more information about stopping service.

The topics in this section describe the start/stop page in detail.

###### Start/Stop - Main

**FASTPATH:**
The Description of Page section that appears below simply describes the fields on this page. Refer to How To for a
description of how to perform common start/stop functions.

Use Menu > Customer Information > Start/Stop to open this page.

**Description of Page**

The Account ID and the primary name of the Account's main customer are displayed at the top of the page.

If the total number of pending start/stops for the account does not exceed the start stop details threshold defined in
Installation Options, the grid contains an entry for every Pending Start and Pending Stop service agreement linked to the
**Account ID.**

If information appears on the right portion of the grid, that means that "reciprocal relationships" exist. The following points
describe potential reciprocal relationships:


-----

- A reciprocal will be shown for a Pending Start service agreement if the Pending Start service agreement has at least one
service point and if another service agreement is found that satisfies the following criteria:

  - The status of the service agreement is not Canceled or Active,

  - The service agreement is linked to all of the Pending Start service agreement's service points (and all SA/SP records
have the same stop date as defined on the qualifying service agreement).

  - The service agreement's stop date is on/before the start date.

  - The service agreement's SA type has a service type that is the same as the Pending Start service agreement's service
type.

- Note: if multiple service agreements meet the above criteria, the latest qualifying service agreement is shown as the
reciprocal.

- A reciprocal will be shown for a Pending Stop service agreement if the Pending Stop service agreement has at least one
service point and if another service agreement is found that satisfies the following criteria:

  - The status of the service agreement is not Canceled

  - The service agreement is linked to all of the Pending Stop service agreement's service points (and they all have the
same start date as defined on the qualifying service agreement).

  - The service agreement's start date is on/after the stop date.

  - The service agreement's SA type has a service type that is the same as the Pending Stop service agreement's service
type.

- Note: if multiple service agreements meet the above criteria, the earliest qualifying service agreement is shown as the
reciprocal.

**NOTE:**
If multiple reciprocals exist for a given SA, none of the reciprocals will be shown. In this situation, an appropriate
message is displayed highlighting this situation. The existence of multiple reciprocals is rare, but it could happen, for
example, if multiple customers are paying for a service point's service (where one customer pays for 60% of the metered
consumption and the other pays for the remaining 40%).

The following columns appear in the grid:

**Drill Down (button) Click this button to drill down into details of the pending start/stop SA. This button transfers you to**
the Pending SA tab.

**Action An icon will be displayed to highlight if the associated SA is a pending start or a pending stop. The start icon (green**
octagon) appears if the SA is a pending start. The stop icon (red octagon) appears if the SA is a pending stop. If there is a
reciprocal SA for the pending start, the stop icon appears adjacent; clicking it will cause the SA grid to scroll to the left (so
that you can see the pending stop). If there is a reciprocal SA for the pending stop, the start icon appears adjacent; clicking
it will cause the SA grid to scroll to the left (so that you can see the pending start).

**Date This is the start date for pending start service agreements and the stop date for pending stop service agreements.**

**Cancel Turn on this switch if you wish to cancel the pending start/stop.**

**NOTE:**
**Field activity requests will be cancelled too. If you cancel a pending start/stop that has field activity requests, the**
field activity requests will also be cancelled. Refer to Starting Service and Field Activities for the details about how the
system automatically creates the field activity requests to support start service requests. Also, refer to Stopping Service
and Field Activities for the details about how the system creates the field activity requests to support stop service
requests.


-----

**System-generated reciprocals will be cancelled too. If you cancel a pending start/stop that has a SYSTEM-**
GENERATED reciprocal SA, the reciprocal will also be cancelled.

**Premise Information If a characteristic premise is linked to the service agreement, summary information about the pending**
start/stop SA's characteristic premise is displayed.

**SA Information Summary information about the pending start/stop SA is displayed.**

**Action If this column is blank, then there is no reciprocal start/stop for the service agreement whose details appear to the**
left. If this column is not blank, then the information that appears to the right describes the reciprocal SA of the SA to the
left. If a reciprocal SA exists, two icons will always appear: if a start and stop combination appears, the SA to the left is a
pending stop (and clicking the stop icon will cause the pending stop to appear); if a stop and start combination appears, the
SA to the left is a pending start (and clicking the start icon will cause the pending start to appear).

**Date This is the start date for pending start service agreements and the stop date for pending stop service agreements.**

**Cancel Turn on this switch if you wish to cancel the pending start/stop.**

**NOTE:**
**Field activity requests will be cancelled too. If you cancel a pending start/stop that has field activity requests, the**
field activity requests will also be cancelled. Refer to Starting Service and Field Activities for the details about how the
system automatically creates the field activity requests to support start service requests. Refer to Stopping Service and
Field Activities for the details about how the system creates the field activity requests to support stop service requests.

**System-generated reciprocals will be cancelled too. If you cancel a pending start/stop that has a SYSTEM-**
GENERATED reciprocal SA, the reciprocal will also be cancelled.

**Account Info The name of the main customer associated with the reciprocal's service agreement's account is displayed.**

**Premise Information Summary information about the pending start/stop premise is displayed.**

**SA Information Summary information about the pending start/stop SA is displayed.**

If the total number of pending start/stops for the account exceeds the start stop details threshold defined in Installation
Options, the Total number of Pending Starts and Total number of Pending Stops is displayed together with a grid
containing a summary of the pending start and pending stops.

The grid contains an entry for every group of Pending Start / Pending Stop service agreement linked to the Account ID with
the same pending start / pending stop date, action, premise, and CIS division/SA Type.

The following columns appear in the grid:

**Date This is the start date for pending start service agreements and the stop date for pending stop service agreements.**

**Action An icon will be displayed to highlight if the associated SA(s) are pending start or pending stop. The start icon (green**
octagon) appears if the SA(s) are a pending start. The stop icon (red octagon) appears if the SA(s) are a pending stop. Click
the icon to navigate to the Start Stop - Pending SA tab where the associated pending start / pending stop service agreements
will be displayed.

**Premise Information Summary information about the pending start/stop premise is displayed.**

**CIS Division / SA Type This is the CIS division and service agreement type of the pending start / pending stop service**
agreements.

**Total This is the total number of service agreements with the same Date, Action, Premise, and CIS Division / SA Type.**

Following the Pending Start / Pending Stop grid are two sections; one is used to start service, the other is used to stop
service.

The following points describe the fields in the start service section (refer to How To for a description of how to perform
common start functions).

- Use Start Date to define the date on which you want service to commence.


-----

- Use Start Method to define what you want to start. Valid values are:

  - Start Premise SPs. Use this method if you want to start selected services at a premise. This method allows you to
control the display of the service agreements to be started, providing a manageable view when there are many service
agreements to be started at a premise.

  - Start a Premise. Use this method if you want to start services at a premise.

  - Start a SA. Use this method if you want to start a non-premise-oriented service (e.g., a deposit, a charitable
contribution, a one-time charge).

- If you have selected the Start Premise SPs or Start a Premise option, use Address and City to select the premise. Refer
to Control Central - Search for suggestions in respect of how to use these fields. The selected address and premise ID
appear below the selection.

**NOTE:** If the service agreement’s account’s CIS Division’s Restrict to Account CIS Division flag is set to
_Restricted, the premise search is restricted to the premises without a CIS Division and those whose CIS Division_
matches the account’s CIS Division,

- If you have selected the Start a SA option, use CIS Division and SA Type to define the type of service agreement you
wish to start.

**NOTE:** If the service agreement’s account’s CIS Division’s Restrict to Account CIS Division flag is set to Restricted,
the CIS Division is set to the account’s CIS Division and cannot be changed.

**WARNING:**
Take special care when adding a new service agreement to specify the appropriate CIS Division / SA Type as it will
affect how the customer is billed, what rate can be specified, how overdue debt is collected, and much more. After the
service agreement is activated, you may not change its SA type.

- Use Requested by to define who requested the stop (e.g., Customer, Jane Smith ).

- Click the Start button to start service. When you click this button, the Start Confirmation page appears.

The following points describe the fields in the stop service section (refer to How To for a description of how to perform
common stop functions).

- Use Stop Date to define the date on which you want service to stop.

- Use Stop Method to define what you want to stop. Valid values are:

  - Stop Selected SAs. Use this method if you want to stop selected service agreements linked to the account.

  - Stop a Premise. Use this method if you want to stop ALL services at a premise.

  - Stop a SA. Use this method if you want to stop a specific SA.

  - Stop all Active SAs. Use this method if you want to stop ALL service agreements linked to the account.

- If you have selected the Stop a Premise option, choose the Premise ID. You can optionally choose a specific premise if
you selected the Stop Selected SAs option.

- If you have selected the Stop a SA option, choose the SA ID.

- Use Requested by to define who requested the stop (e.g., Customer, Jane Smith ).

- Click the Stop button to stop service.

**NOTE:** Manual date entry is disabled on the start and stop dates and the date picker must be used when the Disable
Manual Date Entry Option Type on the Customer Information Options Feature Configuration has been enabled.

###### Start/Stop - Start Confirmation

The Start SA Confirmation page appears after a user clicks the Start button on Start/Stop - Main. This page presents a
summary of the service agreement(s) that will be created if the Start button on this page is clicked. Refer to How To for a
description of how to perform common start functions.

**Description of Page**

The Account ID and the primary name of the account's main customer are displayed at the top of the page.

The Start Date is the date on which the service is scheduled to start.

**Start Requested By contains the name of the person who requested the start.**

The SAs to Start scroll contains an entry for every service agreement that will be created if you click the Start button. If
you do not want a service agreement to be created, click the - button (or turn off Start this SA). If you'd like to start a nonpremise oriented service agreement, click the + button. The following fields appear on this page:

**Start this SA Turn this switch on if you want this type of service agreement to be created. Turn this switch off if you do not**
want this type of service agreement to be created.

If you used a Start Method of Start a SA on the Start/Stop page, this switch will be turned on by default.

If you used a Start Method of Start a Premise (or Start Premise SPs ) and this is the first customer at a premise, this switch
will be turned on for all service agreements that appear in the scroll. However, if there was a previous customer at the
premise, this switch is only turned on for those types of service agreements used by the previous customer (we assume the
new customer only wants the services used by the previous customer). Service agreements that are possible, but were not
used by the previous customer, will appear in the scroll with this switch turned off.

**CIS Division / SA Type These fields define the type of service agreement that will be created. If you change the CIS**
Division, you must change the SA Type to reflect one of the services that the division manages.

**NOTE:** If the service agreement’s account’s CIS Division’s Restrict to Account CIS Division flag is set to Restricted,
the CIS Division is set to the account’s CIS Division and cannot be changed.

If the SA is linked to a service point, the SA types are restricted based on the type(s) of service points (SP) the system has
associated with the service agreement (as indicated in the message box). If there are no SPs, only SA types that don't use
SPs are displayed. If there is a single SP, only SA types valid for the related SP Type are displayed. If there are multiple
SPs, only SA types valid for all related SP Types are displayed.

**Start Option Some SA Types have start options. A start option defines the rate and contract terms defaulted on the service**
agreement. This field will be gray if the SA type does not use start options.

**Total Amount to Bill Use this field if the service agreement is supposed to bill a given amount over its lifetime. This is**
typically used for deposit service agreements to define the amount of the deposit that should be billed. If the deposit is billed
in installments, the installment amount is specified in the next field. This field is gray if the respective SA type doesn't use
the Total Amount to Bill option.

This button is only appears if the SA type has a "special role" of Cash Deposit and references a deposit class. When
clicked, the system attempts to calculate a recommended deposit amount by calling the recommended deposit amount
algorithm that is plugged in on the SA type's deposit class.

**Customer Read Use this value to define if the customer reads their own meter. Valid values are Yes and No. This field**
does not appear for some SA types.

**Allow Estimates Turn on this switch if it's OK for the system to use estimated usage from Oracle Utilities Meter Data**
Management for this service agreement's agreement consumption if a real meter read is missing at billing time. If the SA
type does not allow estimates, this does not appear.


-----

**Recurring Charge Amount This field's label is dynamic based on the content of the Recurring Charge Amount Label on**
the respective SA Type. This field is gray if the respective SA type doesn't use the Recurring Charge option. This field is
typically used only for the following types of service agreements:

- Service agreements on a levelized payment plan. This field contains the amount charged each month for the service
regardless of the actual amount owed.

- Merchandise service agreements on an installment plan. This field contains the installment amount.

- Deposit service agreements on an installment plan. This field contains the installment amount.

- Charitable contribution service agreement. This field contains the contribution amount.

**NOTE:**
**Default note. The recurring charge amount defaults based on the Start Option.**

**SIC Select the SIC code associated with the customer. This is typically used only for commercial and industrial customers.**

**Business Activity Enter a description of the business activity at the location where this service is being started.**

**SA Information This is a display-only area that provides information about the specific pending start SA. For example,**
information about the service points linked to the SA will be displayed for SP-oriented service agreements.

**Messages This is a display-only area that that provides information about the account's start/stop situation in general. For**
example, if there are multiple accounts paying for service at the premise an appropriate message will be displayed.

When you click the Start button, the system performs the following for every service:

- A service agreement is created effective on the start date.

- If a start option is specified, the service agreement's rate and contract terms are populated using information on the
option. If a start option is not specified, the service agreement's rate is populated with the SA type's default rate.

- Service points are linked to the service agreement (if the service agreement is service point-oriented). The SA/SP start
date for each service point is the same as the SA's start date.

If you use a Start Method of Start Premise SPs on Start/Stop - Main, the SAs to Start are displayed in a grid; you can
control the service agreements that appear using filter options. You may want to use the filter if you have a premise with a
large number of service agreements to start.

**Premise Info displays summary information about the premise at which services are to be started.**

The section beneath PremiseInfo provides you with options that control which service agreements appear in the grid. The
following points describe the various options:

- Use the SP Type Filter to restrict the service agreements that appear in the grid based on the SP type of the service
points that will be linked to the service agreement. The following options are available:

  - All. Use this option if you do not wish to restrict service agreements based on service point type.

  - Specific SP Type. Use this option to restrict service agreements to those that will be linked to service points of a
specific SP Type.

- Use the Geographic Type Filter to restrict the service agreements that appear in the grid based on a geographic type and
value of the service points that will be linked to the service agreement. The following options are available:

  - All. Use this option if you do not wish to restrict service agreements based on a geographic type and value.

  - <Geographic Type>. Use this option to restrict service agreements to those that will be linked to service points
associated with the selected geographic type and GeographicValue.

- Select whether to Include or Exclude service agreements that are linked to service points where Service Exists Already.
These service agreements are those that would be not be started by default. Refer to the description of the Start this SA
checkbox for more information on service agreements that would be not be started by default.

Don't forget to click the search button after changing the filters.


-----

The Select All / Clear All buttons are used to select service agreements to start. These buttons are enabled if at least one
service agreement is displayed in the grid.

**NOTE:**
**30 service agreements at a time. Clicking Select All selects the first 30 service agreements in the grid. If more than 30**
service agreements exist, you must select and start them in batches.

The grid that displays contains the SAs to Start that match your filter criteria. Click the drill down button to open the Start
**SA Confirmation Details page.**

The fields in the grid on the Start SA Confirmation page and on the Start SA Confirmation Details page are as described
above for the SAs to Start scroll. Differences are highlighted here:

**SP Info This is summary information about the service point at which service is to be started.**

**SP Identifier The service point's SP type's identifying geographic type and value. Refer to Understanding Service Point**
Types. Up to three geo types and values are displayed in the SAs to Start grid.

Click the Start button on the Start SA Confirmation page to start the selected SAs. Click on the Close button to return to the
main page - any changes made on this page since the last time you clicked Start are discarded.

###### Start/Stop - Stop Confirmation

If you choose the stop method of Stop Selected SAs, the Stop SA Confirmation page appears after a user clicks the Stop
button on Start/Stop - Main. This page presents a summary of the service agreement(s) that will be stopped if the Stop
button on this page is clicked. Refer to How To for a description of how to perform common start stop functions.

**Description of Page**

The Account ID and the primary name of the account's main customer are displayed at the top of the page.

The Stop Date is the date on which the service is scheduled to stop.

**Requested By contains the name of the person who requested the stop.**

The section beneath Requested By provides you with options that control which service agreements appear in the grid. The
following points describe the various options:

- Use the Premise Filter to restrict the service agreements to those that are linked to a specific characteristic premise. The
following options are available:

  - All. Use this option if you do not wish to restrict service agreements based on premise.

  - No Premise. Use this option to restrict service agreements to those that do not have a characteristic premise.

  - Specific Premise. Use this option to restrict service agreements to those with a characteristic premise of Premise ID.

- Use the SA Type Filter to restrict service agreements to those of a given SA Type.

  - All. Use this option if you do not wish to restrict service agreements based on SA Type.

  - Specific SA Type. Use this option to restrict service agreements to those of a given CIS Division and SA Type.

- Use the Geographic Type Filter to restrict the service agreements that appear in the grid based on the geographic type
and value of the service points that are linked to the service agreement. The following options are available:

  - All. Use this option if you do not wish to restrict service agreements based on a geographic type and value.

  - <Geographic Type>. Use this option to restrict service agreements to those that will be linked to service points /
premises associated with the selected geographic type and GeographicValue.

Don't forget to click the search button after changing the filters.

**Premise Information Summary information about the pending stop premise is displayed.**

**SA Information Summary information about the pending stop SA is displayed.**

**SP Identifier The service point's SP type's identifying geographic type and value. Refer to Setting Up Service Point Types.**
Up to three geo types and values are displayed.

Click the Stop button on the Stop SA Confirmation page to stop the selected SAs. Click on the Close button to return to the
main page - any changes made on this page since the last time you clicked Stop are discarded.

###### Start/Stop - Address/Phone

Open Menu > Customer Information > Start/Stop and navigate to the Address/Phone page to change basic information
about a customer while you are starting or stopping service.

**NOTE:**
**A subset of person and account information. This page features a subset of person and account fields that typically**
change when a customer moves. You can always use the Person or Account transactions to change this information.

**This information is held in limbo. The information on this page will only be updated on the respective person / account**
when the first service agreement linked to the account is activated or stopped (i.e., this information is held in limbo until
the pending start / pending stop is activated / stopped).

**Main customer information. The information on this page is associated with the account's main customer (as defined**
on Account - Person Information ). If you need to change information about any other person linked to the account, you
must transfer to Account - Person Information and make the changes there.

Use Bill Route Type to indicate how the bill is sent to the customer. If the Bill Route Type you select indicates that bills
are routed via fax, make sure you specify a fax number in the Telephone Numbers below (note, the system knows which
of a person's phone numbers is a fax number by the phone type). If the Bill Route Type you select indicates that bills are
routed via Email, make sure to specify the person's Email Address below. If the Bill Route Type you selected indicates
that bills are routed via the postal service, select the appropriate Address Source. You have the following options:

- Choose Mailing Premise on Account if bills should be sent to the account's mailing premise. This address is displayed
below.

- Choose Person if bills should be sent to theperson's mailing address. This address is displayed below.

- Choose Account Override if bills should be sent to the account person's override address. This address is displayed
below. Typically, you would only choose this option if the person has multiple accounts and each account's bills should
be sent to a different address.

If the Address Source is Person or Account Override, the respective address fields are displayed and may be changed. If
the Address Source is Mailing Premise on Account, the account's mailing premise is displayed and cannot be modified.
Refer to Premise - Main Information for information about these fields.


-----

**NOTE:**
**Default note. If you switch the Bill Route Type from a non-postal to postal routed, the Address Source defaults to**
the bill address source defined on the account (if one exists) or Mailing Premise on Account if bill address source is not
specified for the main customer.

**NOTE:**
By default, the Address Source field is protected on Start/Stop– Address/Phone page if the Bill Route Type is set to
a value other than Postal. To enable the Address Source field for all Bill Route Types in most circumstances, set the
Always Enable Address Source option type on the General System Configuration feature configuration to Y.

Regardless of the Always Enable Address Source option value, Address Source and Address Information are
displayed but both are disabled when Bill Routing Method is Not Postal and Quote Routing Method (on Account –
Persons page) is Postal. A message “The Main Person receives Quotes at this address. To edit it, go to the 'Persons' tab
_on the Account.” is displayed next to the Address Source._

**FASTPATH:**
Refer to Setting Up Bill Route Types for more information about bill route types.

**NOTE:**
The person contact collections appears when the Legacy Person Phone and Email Option Type on the Customer
Information Options Feature Configurationhas not been enabled.

The person contacts, from the Person - Main page are displayed so that you can review and update them as necessary.

**NOTE:** The Email Address field appears when the Legacy Person Phone and Email Option Type on the Customer
Information Options Feature Configuration has been enabled.

Specify the customer's Email Address. This can be used to route bills to the customer via email (if your bill routing
software supports this function).

**Telephone Numbers are used by Control Central to look for accounts and persons. If the person has more than 20 phone**
numbers, the first 20 will be shown as display only with a message indicating that more phone numbers exist until you save
your start or stop. Once the start or stop has been saved, you are able to modify the phone number collection.

**NOTE:** The Person Phone grid appears when the Legacy Person Phone and Email Option Type on the Customer
Information Options Feature Configuration has been enabled.

The following fields display:

- **Phone Type indicates the type of phone number, e.g., Home, Mobile, Business, ...**

- Use Phone Number to define the telephone number. Enter the telephone number in the format described by the Phone
**Format.**

**NOTE:**
**Formatting is performed by a plug-in. The format that is applied to a Phone Number is controlled by the algorithm**
that is plugged in on the respective Phone Type. If you prefer a different format, your system administrator should
configure this algorithm appropriately.

- Enter the Extension, if any, of the telephone number.

###### Start/Stop - Pending SA

If you need to change additional information about the pending start or stop SAs, navigate to the Pending SA tab.
Alternatively, you can click the Drill Down button on the SA grid of the Main tab.

**Description of Page**

If the total number of pending start/stops for the account does not exceed the start stop details threshold defined in
Installation Options, an entry appears in the scroll for each entry in the SA grid on the main page. Use the Pending Start/
**Stop SA navigation arrow buttons to select the pending SA you want to review or modify. This page is split between the**
primary SA on the top, and the reciprocal SA on the bottom. The following fields are available.

Primary SA:

**SA Info Summary information about the pending start/stop SA is displayed.**

**Cancel Turn on this switch if you wish to cancel the pending start/stop.**

**Date This is the start date for pending start service agreements and the stop date for pending stop service agreements.**

**Reason This column indicates if the pending start/stop is System Generated or Customer Requested. System-generated**
starts are created when a tenant stops service at a premise covered by a landlord agreement. System-generated stops are
created when a customer requests a start at a premise where the existing customer hadn't already requested a stop.

**CIS Division / SA Type These fields define the type of service agreement that will be created. These fields will be gray if**
the service agreement is pending stop.

If you change the CIS Division, you must change the SA Type to reflect one of the services that the division manages.

If the SA is linked to a service point, the SA types are restricted based on the type(s) of service points (SP) the system has
associated with the service agreement (as indicated in the message box). If there are no SPs, only SA types that don't use
SPs are displayed. If there is a single SP, only SA types valid for the related SP Type are displayed. If there are multiple
SPs, only SA types valid for all related SP Types are displayed.

**Start Option Some SA Types have start options. A start option defines the rate and contract terms defaulted on the service**
agreement. This field will be gray if the SA type does not use start options or if the service agreement is pending stop.

**Premise Summary information about the pending start / stop premise is displayed.**

Reciprocal SA:

**SA Info Summary information about the pending start/stop SA is displayed.**

**Cancel Turn on this switch if you wish to cancel the pending start/stop.**

**Date This is the start date for pending start service agreements and the stop date for pending stop service agreements.**

**Reason This column indicates if the pending start/stop is System Generated or Customer Requested. System-generated**
starts are created when a tenant stops service at a premise covered by a landlord agreement. System-generated stops are
created when a customer requests a start at a premise where the existing customer hadn't already requested a stop.

**CIS Division / SA Type These fields define the type of service agreement that will be created or stopped. This field will be**
gray if the service agreement is pending stop.

If you change the CIS Division, you must change the SA Type to reflect one of the services that the division manages.

If the SA is linked to a service point, the SA types are restricted based on the type(s) of service points (SP) the system has
associated with the service agreement (as indicated in the message box). If there are no SPs, only SA types that don't use
SP's are displayed. If there is a single SP, only SA types valid for the related SP Type are displayed. If there are multiple
SPs, only SA types valid for all related SP Types are displayed.

**Start Option Some SA Types have start options. A start option defines the rate and contract terms defaulted on the service**
agreement. This field will be gray if the SA type does not use start options or if the service agreement is pending stop.


-----

**Premise Summary information about the pending start / stop premise is displayed.**

**Account The name of the main customer associated with the reciprocal's service agreement's account is displayed.**

If the total number of pending start/stops for the account exceeds the start stop details threshold defined in Installation
Options, the pending start/stop SAs and their reciprocal SAs are displayed in a grid; you can control the service agreements
that appear using filter options.

The section beneath Account provides you with options that control which service agreements appear in the grid. The
following points describe the various options:

- Use the SA Action Filter to restrict the service agreements that appear in the grid to pending starts or pending stops. The
following options are available:

  - All. Use this option if you do not wish to restrict service agreements based on SA Action.

  - Start. Use this option to restrict service agreements to pending starts.

  - Stop. Use this option to restrict service agreements to pending stops.

- Use the date filter to restrict service agreements to those that will start or stop between the From Date and the To Date.

- Use the Premise Filter to restrict the service agreements to those that are linked to a specific characteristic premise. The
following options are available:

  - All. Use this option if you do not wish to restrict service agreements based on premise.

  - No Premise. Use this option to restrict service agreements to those that do not have a characteristic premise.

  - Specific Premise. Use this option to restrict service agreements to those with a characteristic premise of Premise ID.

- Use the SA Type Filter to restrict service agreements to those of a given SA Type.

  - All. Use this option if you do not wish to restrict service agreements based on SA Type.

  - Specific SA Type. Use this option to restrict service agreements to those of a given CIS Division and SA Type.

- Use the Geographic Type Filter to restrict the service agreements that appear in the grid based on the geographic type
and value of the service points that are linked to the service agreement. The following options are available:

  - All. Use this option if you do not wish to restrict service agreements based on a geographic type and value.

  - <Geographic Type>. Use this option to restrict service agreements to those that will be linked to service points /
premises associated with the selected geographic type and GeographicValue.

Don't forget to click the search button after changing the filters.

The Select All / Clear All buttons are used to select service agreements if you plan on issuing any of the mass update
actions at the bottom of the page. These buttons are enabled if at least one service agreement is displayed in the grid.

**NOTE:**
**30 service agreements at a time. Clicking Select All selects the first 30 service agreements in the grid. If more than 30**
service agreements exist, you must select and start them in batches.

The grid that displays contains the service agreements that match your search criteria. Click on the drill down button to open
the Pending SA Details page.

Please refer to the Pending Start/Stop SA scroll for a description of the fields in the pending start/stop SA grid on the
Pending SA tab and on the Pending SA Details page. Additional fields are described here:

Pending SAs Grid:

- **Select box. Use this checkbox to select service agreements for mass update.**

- The Action icons highlight if the associated SA is a pending start or a pending stop and if there are reciprocal SAs. Refer
to the action icon on Start Stop - Main.

Mass Update Buttons:


-----

Use the Cancel Selected button to cancel the selected pending start/stops together with any associated reciprocal pending
start/stops. This button is enabled if you have selected one or more pending SAs.

Use the Change Start/Stop Date button to change the start/stop date for the selected pending start/stop service agreements.
If a selected start/stop has a reciprocal SA, its start/stop date is also changed. This button is enabled if you have selected one
or more pending SAs.

###### Start/Stop - Pending Field Activity

When you start/stop service point-oriented service, field activity requests are typically created. You can view every noncancelled, non-complete field activity linked to the account's service agreements on the Pending Field Activity page.

**NOTE:**
The field activity requests are NOT limited to those associated with starting / stopping service. So, if a customer has a
pending "cut for non payment" field activity request, it would also appear on this page.

**Description of Page**

An entry appears in the scroll for every Pending field activity request linked to the account's service agreements. The
information in the Field Activity column contains a summary of the field activity request and its service point. The
information in the How Used column describes the purpose of the field activity request (such as, Start Activity, Stop
Activity, and Severance Activity).

If the total number of pending start/stops for the account exceeds the start stop details threshold defined in Installation
Options, you can control the field activity requests that appear using filter options.

The section beneath Account provides you with options that control which field activity requests appear in the grid. The
following points describe the various options:

- Use the Schedule Date filter to restrict the field activity requests that appear in the grid to those that are scheduled
between. The following options are available:

  - All. Use this option if you do not wish to restrict field activities to a specific schedule date.

  - Specific Date. Use this option to restrict the field activities to those with a schedule date between the From Date and
the To Date.

- Use the Premise Filter to restrict the field activity requests to those that are linked to service points at a specific premise.
The following options are available:

  - All. Use this option if you do not wish to restrict field activity requests based on premise.

  - Specific Premise. Use this option to restrict field activity requests to those linked to a service point at the given
**Premise ID.**

- Use the SP Type Filter to restrict field activity requests to those that are linked to service points of a given SP Type.

  - All. Use this option if you do not wish to restrict field activity requests based on SP Type.

  - Specific SA Type. Use this option to restrict field activity requests to those of a given SP Type.

- Use the Geographic Type Filter to restrict the field activity requests that appear in the grid based on the geographic type
and value of the service points that are linked to the service agreement. The following options are available:

  - All. Use this option if you do not wish to restrict field activity requests based on a geographic type and value.

  - <Geographic Type>. Use this option to restrict field activity requests to those that are linked to service points /
premises associated with the selected geographic type and GeographicValue.

Don't forget to click the search button after changing the filters.

###### How To

The topics in this section describe how to perform common start/stop functions.

###### How To Start Service At A Premise

The following instructions specifically reference the Start a Premise Start Method. You can also use the Start a Premise's
_SPs Start Method and its corresponding user interface._

You navigate through the pages as follows:

- Use Control Central - Search to look for the customer. If the customer exists, click the Start Service button to transfer to
Start/Stop. If the customer doesn't exist, add a new person/account by following the instructions under How To Add A
New Customer From Control Central.

- Specify the Start Date, Start Method (Start a Premise), and select a premise (by entering the premise Address and
clicking the search button).

- Click the Start button to review the various service agreements that will be created.

**NOTE:**
**Service agreements are created. Each row in the scroll is associated with a service agreement. When you close the**
page, the system creates new service agreements in the state of pending start.

- If you're starting service at a premise, the system automatically populates the Start Confirmation page with information
about every service agreement to be created. To do this, we make a basic assumption - the customer wants every service
at the premise. If this assumption is incorrect, simply remove the service agreement from the scroll (by turning off the
**Start this SA switch) before closing the page.**

**NOTE:**
**Automatically stop the existing customer. If there's a customer currently paying for service at the premise, the system**
automatically sets up the stop information for the existing customer. The stop date of the existing customer is the start
date of the new customer. If you don't want to stop the existing customer, simply indicate such in the scroll.

**WARNING:**
Take special care when adding a new service agreement to specify the appropriate CIS Division and SA Type as it will
affect how the customer is billed, what rate can be specified, how overdue debt is collected, and much more. After the
service agreement is activated, you may not change its CIS Division / SA type.

**FASTPATH:**
Refer to Starting Service and Field Activities for the details about how the system automatically creates the field activity
requests to support start service requests.

###### How To Stop Service At A Premise

The following instructions specifically reference the Stop a Premise Stop Method. You can also use the Start Selected SAs
Stop Method and its corresponding user interface.


-----

You navigate through the pages as follows:

- Use Control Central - Search to find the customer. Click the Stop Service button to transfer to Start/Stop.

- Specify the Stop Date, StopMethod (Stop a Premise), and select a Premise (the premise will have been pre-selected for
you if you drilled down from Control Central).

- Click the Stop button to stop service at the premise.

- When you click the stop button, the system changes the status of each service agreement to pending stop and sets the
stop date accordingly. If we stopped a service agreement that we shouldn't have, simply cancel the stop by checking the
**Cancel column in the grid (and save the page)**

**NOTE:**
**Landlord reversion. If you stop service at a premise that references a landlord agreement, the system will automatically**
create pending start service agreements for the landlord for those service types covered by the landlord agreement.

**FASTPATH:**
Refer to Stopping Service and Field Activities for the details about how the system creates the field activity requests to
support stop service requests.

###### How To Start A Deposit

Charging a customer for a deposit involves creating a service agreement. Deposit service agreements are just like other
service agreements in many ways:

- The system bills the customer for the deposit using information on the service agreement.

- The customer pays for the billed amount.

- If the customer doesn't pay, credit & collections starts a collection process to encourage the customer to pay.

Deposit service agreements differ from regular service agreements in the following ways:

- Deposit service agreements typically don't cause a receivable account to be affected when the deposit is billed. It is only
when the deposit is paid that a financial transaction occurs (debit cash, credit deposit payable).

- Deposit service agreements have a credit balance when the billed amount is paid (the deposit paid by the customer is a
liability of your company - it owes the customer this money).

- Deposit service agreements may be billed in installments or in a lump sum.

Creating a deposit service agreement involves the following steps:

- Select the account on Control Central and open Start/Stop.

- Enter a Start Date and Start Method of Start a Premise.

- Indicate the premise that the deposit service agreement will cover using the Address and click the Start button.

- After you click the Start button, the Start Confirmation page will appear:

  - Choose an appropriate CIS Division / SA Type for the deposit service agreement.

  - If Start Options have been created for the CIS Division / SA Type, you need only select the appropriate option and
close the page. The system will use the information on the start option to populate the service agreement's billing
parameters (e.g., the total deposit due, the installment amount, etc.).

  - If Start Options have not been created for the CIS Division / SA Type, you must define the total amount of the
deposit and the installment amount, if any. You define the total amount of the deposit in Total Amount To Bill. You

can have the system recommend a deposit amount by pushing the that appears adjacent to this field.


-----

  - If you allow the customer to pay the deposit in installments, define the Installment Amount (the prompt for this field
is defined on the SA type and therefore will differ depending on how you've set up the system). After defining this
information, close the page. The system will use the information you entered to create a deposit service agreement.

**NOTE:**
The above information related to starting a deposit assumes that the deposit SA Type is set up as a premise-based
service. If your company does not associate a deposit with a specific premise, you will need to set up your SA Type for
the deposit accordingly. Then, you will need to use a Start Method of Start a SA.

###### How To Start A Charitable Contribution

If a customer elects to contribute money to a charitable organization, you must create a service agreement. Charitable
contribution service agreements are just like other service agreements in many ways:

- The system bills the customer for the elected contribution amount using information on the service agreement.

- The customer pays the billed amount.

- If the customer doesn't pay, credit & collections may start a collection process to encourage the customer to pay
(depending upon how the charitable contributions debt class has been set up on your system).

Charitable contribution service agreements differ from regular service agreements in the following ways:

- Charitable contribution service agreements typically don't cause a receivable account to be affected when the charitable
contribution is billed. It is only when the charitable contribution is paid that a financial transaction occurs (debit cash,
credit charitable contribution payable).

- Charitable contribution service agreements have no balance when the billed amount is paid because the money is being
forwarded to a charity.

Creating a charitable contribution service agreement involves the following steps:

- Select the account on Control Central and open Start/Stop.

- Enter a Start Date and Start Method of Start a SA.

- Indicate the CIS Division / SA Type of the charitable contribution agreement and click the Start button.

- After you click the Start button, the Start Confirmation page will appear:

  - If Start Options have been created for the CIS Division / SA Type, you need only select the appropriate option and
close the page. The system will use the information on the start option to populate the service agreement's billing
parameters (i.e., the charitable contribution amount to be periodically billed).

  - If Start Options have not been created for the CIS Division / SA Type, you must define the charitable contribution
amount (the prompt for this field is defined on the SA type and therefore will differ depending on how you've set up
the system). After defining this information, close the page. The system will use the information you entered to create
a charitable contribution service agreement.

###### How To Start A One-Time Charge Service Agreement

You create a one-time charge (i.e., billable charge) whenever a customer should be charged for a service that occurs outside
the normal course of business. For example, you would create a billable charge to charge a contractor for the repair of a
ruptured gas line.

A billable charge must reference a service agreement. This service agreement behaves just like any other service agreement:


-----

- **Bill segments are created for the service agreement. Whenever billing is performed for an account with billable**
charge service agreements, the system creates a bill segment for each unbilled billable charges.

- **Payments are distributed to the service agreement. Payments made by an account are distributed to its billable charge**
service agreements just like any other service agreement.

- **Overdue debt is monitored. The credit and collections process monitors billable charge service agreements for overdue**
debt and responds accordingly when overdue debt is detected.

Therefore, in order to levy a one-time charge, the customer must have a billable charge service agreement. If one already
exists (because of a previous billable charge), you don't have to create a new service agreement. Rather, transfer to the
Billable Charge page and add a billable charge for the service agreement. If the customer doesn't already have billable
charge service agreement, create one by performing the following steps:

- Select the account on Control Central and open Start/Stop.

- Enter a Start Date and Start Method of Start a SA.

- Indicate the CIS Division / SA Type of the billable charge service agreement and click the Start button.

- After you click the Start button, the Start Confirmation page will appear. Simply close the confirmation page to save the
agreement.

- After the billable charge service agreement has been created, add a billable charge to it (the easiest way is to use the SA
context menu). Refer to Maintaining Billable Charges for more information.

###### How To Start Service When Multiple Service Points Measure Consumption

When you start service at a premise, the system automatically links service points to service agreements in the same manner
as existed for the previous customer. So, if the previous customer amalgamated consumption of three service points and
billed this under a single service agreement, the system will create the same configuration for the new customer.

This works fine when the unusual service point configurations have already been set up for the previous customer.
However, it doesn't work when the premise is new. So, if you have a new premise that has multiple service points whose
consumption needs to be amalgamated under a single service agreement, do the following:

- Start service for only one of the service points to be linked to the service agreement. When you start service, the system
creates a service agreement, links the service point to it, and links a field activity to the service point.

- For every service point that wasn't linked to the service agreement:

  - Link the service point to the pending service agreement This task is done on Service Agreement - SA / SP.

    -    - After linking all the service points to the pending service agreement, manually activate the service agreement.
This task is done on Service Agreement – Main. While the service agreement might not be truly activated at this
time, this step ensures necessary field activity requests are created behind the scenes.

field activity requests

**NOTE:**
**That's it. The activation process will automatically activate the service agreement when the fieldwork is complete on all**
of its service points.

##### Customer Contacts

Customer contacts are used to record when and why a customer contacted your company. They can also be associated with
person, accounts, and premises. This information can be used for both audit and statistical purposes. The topics in this
section provide details about how customer contacts are created and used in the system.


-----

###### Person-Based Versus Premise-Based Customer Contacts

Customer Contacts can be linked to the person, account, and premise.

- If a person is associated with the customer contact, it is considered to be a person-based contact regardless of whether an
account and/or premise are also associated with the contact.

- If only a premise is associated with the customer contact, the system will designate the contact as premise-based.

- Contacts that have an account associated with them must also have a person associated and the contact will become
person-based. There are no account-based customer contacts.

Customer Contacts that are associated with a person, account, and/or premise can be accessed through each entity’s context
menu.

###### How Customer Contacts Are Created

You can add a Customer Contact at any time using either of the following methods:

- Use the customer contact maintenance page.

- Use the Customer Contact Zone on the dashboard.

When customer contacts are created through the Customer Contact dashboard zone, the system populates person, account,
and/or premise based on context.

In addition to manually adding customer contacts, your implementation team can set up plug-in algorithms that create
customer contacts when certain events transpire. For example, you can plug-in an algorithm on the customer class object
that creates a customer contact whenever an order is completed. Because the number and type of plug-ins can be customized
for your implementation, we cannot provide a concise list of all such algorithms.

In addition to the above, a variety of events can trigger the creation of a customer contact. Refer to Customer Contacts Are
Used To Trigger Letters for the details.

###### Customer Contacts Are Used To Trigger Letters

In order to send a letter to a customer, a customer contact must be created for the customer. These types of customer
contacts reference a customer contact type that, in turn, references a letter template. The letter template controls the type
of information that is merged into the "form letter" and how the letter is physically produced. Refer to Printing Letters for
more information about letter templates and how letters are physically produced.

Because these letters are being sent to a customer, the customer contact that triggers a letter must be person-based. See
Person-Based Versus Premise-Based Customer Contacts for more information.

Customer contacts that trigger letters can be produced by any of the method described under How Customer Contacts Are
Created. While a user can create this type of customer contact (e.g., if a customer requests a form to sign-up for automatic
payment), the primary sources of customer contacts that trigger letters are via system events and algorithms. Besides
algorithms, the following system events may generate customer contacts automatically:

- **Collection events. When a customer falls in arrears, the system creates a collection process. A collection process is a**
series of events meant to encourage the customer to pay their outstanding debt. A classic collection event is one that
creates a customer contact that, in turn, causes a letter to be sent to the customer requesting payment. These customer
contacts are created with person and account populated. Refer to The Big Picture Of Collection Events for more
information.


-----

- **Severance events. The last event in a collection process typically creates a severance process for each service agreement**
that's in arrears. A severance process is a series of events that leads to service being severed. A classic severance event
is one that creates a customer contact that, in turn, causes a letter to be sent to the customer warning of impending cutoff
(or telling them they've been cutoff and the terms necessary to reinstate service). These customer contacts are created
with person and account populated. Premise is also populated if the service agreement being severed is associated with a
premise. Refer to The Big Picture Of Severance Events for more information.

- **Write-off events. After a customer has been final billed, a write-off process will be created. A write-off process is a**
series of events that leads to the debt being written off. A classic write-off event is one that creates a customer contact
that, in turn, causes a letter to be sent to the customer informing them of that their debt has been referred to a collection
agency. These customer contacts are created with person and account populated. Refer to The Big Picture Of Write Off
Events for more information.

- **Overdue events. Overdue processes can be used to collection on past due debt. An overdue process is a series of events**
that are used to collect on debt. Some overdue events may create a customer contact that, in turn, causes a letter to be
sent to the customer. These customer contacts are created with person and account populated. Refer to The Big Picture
Of Overdue Events for more information.

Your implementation team can introduce plug-in algorithms to create a customer contact when certain events take place. If
the created customer contact references a letter template, a letter will be triggered. Because the number and type of plug-ins
can be customized for your implementation, we cannot provide a concise list of all such algorithms.

Algorithms that are delivered with the product populate person, account, and/or premise based on the information available
when the customer contact is created. For example, the field activity remark algorithm populates the premise and also the
person and account if the field activity’s service point is linked to a service agreement. From the service agreement the
account and account’s main person are obtained and used on the customer contact.

###### A Customer Contact May Trigger Reminders

If you want the system to remind you (via a To Do entry) about a customer-related issue, you can set up a "reminder" on a
customer contact. To do this, follow these steps:

- Determine if you need a new customer contact or if you can reuse one that already exists. If you need a new customer
contact, use any of the "online methods" described under How Customer Contacts Are Created.

- Refer to the embedded help on the Customer Contact Reminders zone on the Customer Contact portal for more
information about using reminders.

###### Customer Contacts Are Used To Record Notifications

Notification types may reference a customer contact type that is used to create a record of notifications of that type. This
is supported for both message-based and template-based notifications. Refer to Template-Based vs. Message-Based
Notification Types for more information.

Customer contacts create from template-based notifications contain more notification details and support an integration that
updates the customer contact with information from an integration system such as Oracle Integration Cloud and also from
the system responsible for delivering the notification. Customer contacts may also be added and updated by an integration
system to record notifications initiated from an external system such as outage notifications that originate from a network
management system.

###### Customer Contacts Can Be Used As Case Files


-----

If a customer calls with a complaint (e.g., they suspect their bill is too high), you can start a "case file" for the complaint by
creating a customer contact. This customer contact should be marked as "open".

**NOTE:**
**Alerts. Customer contacts that are marked as being open cause an alert to appear when the customer is displayed on**
control central.

Over time, as you work on the case, you can add entries to the customer contact’s log to describe your progress.

You can use the customer contact's reminder functionality to remind you to check out the case on a future date (or dates).

When the case is resolved, you simply turn off the customer contact's open indicator and add an appropriate entry to the log
describing the resolution.

###### Maintaining Customer Contacts

Customer contacts are used to record when and why a customer contacted your company. This information is used for
both audit and statistical purposes. The topics in this section describe how to maintain customer contacts. Refer to The Big
Picture Of Customer Contacts for background information about customer contacts.

To view and maintain customer service requests, open Menu > Customer Information > Customer Contact > Search.
You are brought to a query portal with options for searching for customer contacts.

Once a customer contact has been selected, you are brought to the maintenance portal to view and maintain the selected
record.

The following zones are displayed:

- **Customer Contact**

- **Customer Contact Reminders**

Refer to the zones’ embedded help for more information.

##### Printing Letters

As described under Customer Contacts Are Used To Trigger Letters, you must create a customer contact whenever you
want to send a letter to a customer. The contents of this section describe the technical implementation of letter production.

###### The Letter Extract Processes

Customer contacts that trigger letters reference a customer contact type that, in turn, references a letter template. Two
background processes are provided with system that control the information extracted into a file.

**C1-LTPEX – Letter Extract**
This process produces a letter extract file based on letter extract records that are configured with each letter template. Each
letter template can be configured with a different set of record type. Some record types have configuration options such as
which characteristic types to extract or how to identify the object to extract. This is a highly configurable extract that should
reduce the need for a custom solution.

The record layouts can be viewed in the application on the Letter Template Extract Record List zone on the letter template
portal.

**NOTE:**


-----

This batch does not utilize the extract algorithm plug-in spot on letter template. The sample Online Letter Image
algorithm provided with the system calls the letter template extract algorithm plug-in spot and is not compatible with
this solution.

**LTRPRT – Letter Extract**
This process uses the extract algorithm on the letter template and is responsible for extracting the information merged onto
your letters. These algorithms create the "flat file records" that are passed to your letter print software.

Additionally, the extract algorithm can be called if your letter print software has the ability to construct a real-time image
of a letter (in a PDF). You can plug-in an Online Letter Image algorithm on the Installation Record. This type of algorithm
calls the letter template's extract algorithm to extract the information that is merged onto the letter. Refer to Technical
Implementation of Online Letter Production for the details.

**NOTE:**
**Alternate print / routing methods. If you require different print formats, you must create new letter extract algorithms**
and plug them in on your letter template.

**NOTE:**
This process is not intended for new implementations. For information related to the record layouts produced by the
sample algorithms provide for use with this process, please refer to the documentation supplied with CC&B 2.7.0.1 and
earlier.

###### BI Publisher Versus Document Composition Applications

Using BI Publisher as your external reporting tool to display an online letter image differs from using document
composition applications as follows:

- An extract file is not required when using BI Publisher. The sample reports provided to use with these external report
tools do not have to extract information from another object to merge into a letter.

- Generating letters in batch is not supported yet.

**FASTPATH:**
Refer to Letter Print - BI Publisher Sample Welcome Letters - CI_LTRGN_ENG REPORT for more information.

###### Where Does The Address Come From?

The following points describes the source of a letter's address:

- For letters generated as a result of collection events, severance events, write-off events and overdue events, the address is
extracted as follows:

  - The respective Account - Person record is retrieved for the letter recipient (note, the account ID is retrieved from the
related collection / severance / write-off / overdue process).

  - If the person has a seasonal address effective on the business date, the letter's address is the respective seasonal
address.

  - If the address source is Mailing Premise on Account, the letter's address is the account's mailing premise.


-----

  - If the address source is Account Override, the letter's address is the override address on the respective Account Person record.

  - If the address source is Person, the letter's address is the person's mailing address.

  - If the address source is not defined, the person's mailing address is used.

  - If an address was not populated as a result of the above, the letter is not produced and a warning is issued by the
background process responsible for creating the letter extract file.

- For all other types of letters, the address is extracted as follows:

  - If the letter's person has a seasonal address effective on the business date, the letter's address is the respective seasonal
address.

  - If the letter's person has a mailing address, it is used.

  - Otherwise, the system checks if the letter's person has at least one account where the person is the main customer and
the account has at least one active service agreement. If so, the logic described above is executed for the first such
account found.

  - If an address was not populated as a result of the above, the letter is not produced and a warning is issued by the
background process responsible for creating the letter extract file.

###### Technical Implementation Of Online Letter Display

Users can view an image of any letter that is sent to a customer if you plug plug-in an Online Letter Display algorithm on
the Installation Record

**NOTE:** Some display algorithms rely on the extract algorithm on each letter template. Algorithms of this type format
the records that contain the customer information that is passed to your printing software.

The system can make a call to an external system to retrieve a letter image. Many letter print vendors support this
functionality.

The system provides an Installation – Online Letter Display algorithm type (C1GENLTTRURL) that can generate a
dynamic URL.

- The algorithm of this algorithm type supports dynamic variables such as the customer contact ID and static variable such
a vendor or implementation supplied security key.

- The algorithm constructs a URL including generating HASH or security keys.

- The system displays the retrieved image in a separate browser session.

- Refer to the algorithm type description for information about this algorithm type.

The system can interact with either document composition applications, or a reporting engine (such as BI Publisher).

The system provides an Installation – Online Letter Display algorithm type (C1-LT-DISP) that interacts with Documaker to
render an online image of your letter. The following points describe what takes place when clicking Display Letter.

- The algorithm based on this algorithm type calls the letter extract algorithm on each letter template.

- The letter extract algorithm will construct the information that appears on the letter

- The constructed information is passed to document composition software that will reconstruct the letter’s image in a PDF
format.

- The system displays the PDF in a separate browser session. Note that the client must have Adobe Acrobat Reader
installed to view PDF files.


-----

The system provides an algorithm that interacts with BI Publisher to render an online image of a letter. The following points
describe what takes place when clicking Display Letter when these sample algorithms are used.

- The sample Online Letter Display algorithm C1-ONLTR-RPT is executed.

- This algorithm calls the letter extract algorithm. The sample letter extract algorithm C1-LTREX-RPT is supplied for
displaying letters via BI Publisher. This is not actually extracting data because when you use BI Publisher, the report
itself is responsible for extracting and formatting the data. The base product algorithm supplied returns the appropriate
report code to the Online Letter Display algorithm, which in turn returns the report code to the customer contact page.

- A user exit on the customer contact page invokes BI Publisher and displays the letter in a separate browser session.

**FASTPATH:** Refer to Letter Print - BI Publisher Sample Welcome Letters - CI_LTRGN_ENG REPORT for more
information.

###### Reproducing The Letter Print Flat File

You can reproduce the flat file containing the information sent to your printing software at any time. Simply request the
respective extract batch process and specify the run number associated with the historic run.

###### How To Reprint A Specific Letter

If you need to reprint a specific letter, navigate to Customer Contact - Main and turn on the Reprint switch (and save the
customer contact). Alternatively, if your implementation has enabled the online creation of letter images, you can also click
the Display Letter button on this page and then print the resultant PDF on your local printer.

###### Letter Data Area Organization

The following refers to logic supported by letter extract process C1-LTPEX – Letter Extract. Refer to The Letter Extract
Processes for more information.

The letter extract records are defined using data areas. There is an organizing data area that includes a detail data area and
optionally a characteristic data area. The detail data area contains the individual elements. Using the account record as an
example, the organizing data area is “Account Letter Extract Record” and includes two other data areas, “Account Details
Letter Extract” and “Account Characteristics Letter Extract”. This was done to:

- Ensure that characteristic records are extracted directly after their associated record.

- Properly sequence parent records followed by their characteristic then followed by a child record and its characteristic.

- Allow custom extensions to the detail record. See Extending Letter Record Types for more information.

The characteristic data area is only included on objects with a characteristic collection. For consistency, objects without a
characteristic record still follow same pattern with an organizing and detail data area. There are two special records, the end
of letter record and the summary record that do not follow this pattern.

###### Letter Extract File Structure

The following refers to logic supported by letter extract process C1-LTPEX – Letter Extract. Refer to The Letter Extract
Processes for more information.

The letter extract file structure is impacted by the extract format. The extract batch, contains a File Format parameter that
supports XML, CSV, and fixed position extract formats.


-----

When the format is set to XML, the organizing data area as described in Letter Data Area Organization, is treated as a single
schema. The included data areas are nested within the organizing data area. For example, an account record configured with
two characteristics to extract will be nested in a single schema with a detail group and two occurrences of the characteristic
list group.

When the format is set to CSV or fixed position, the included data areas are treated as an individual schema so that each
record is extracted on a separate row. For example, an account record configured with two characteristics to extract will
produce three rows in the extract file.

###### Extending Letter Record Types

The following refers to logic supported by letter extract process C1-LTPEX – Letter Extract. Refer to The Letter Extract
Processes for more information.

Each record type has a business object that defines the format and the logic to extract records of that type. The BO Extract
Record plug-in spot contains the logic to populate the record's data area. This plug-in spot supports multiple algorithms.
Each business object is delivered with one algorithm configured for this plug-in spot that contains the logic to populate the
record type’s elements.

As described in Letter Data Area Organization, there is a detail data area that contains the individual elements for a record
type. If your implementation wants to extend a delivered record type, define a custom data area that extends the detail data
area. The organizing data area should not be extended. To populate the custom data area, create an additional algorithm for
the Extract Record plug-in spot. The record’s schema is passed into the plug-in spot so subsequent algorithms have access
to values defined by previous algorithms.

##### Maintaining Declarations

The declaration page allows you to define a declaration percentage for a combination of account, premise, service type,
declaration type and date range. The declaration may be used by algorithms to adjust certain calculations in the system. For
example you may give certain customers a reduced VAT rate. The declaration is used to indicate the reduced rate for the
qualifying customer.

Open Menu > Customer Information > Declaration > Add to create a new declaration.

**NOTE:**
**Applicable for UK market. This page is intended for the United Kingdom market. Other markets may disregard this**
transaction.

**Description of Page**

##### Service Tasks

The topics in this section describes service tasks.

###### The Big Picture of Service Tasks

Service tasks are records that can be used to perform a variety of tasks. Examples include:

- Task-related records performed by users of other Oracle Utilities applications, such as Oracle Utilities Customer Self
Service.

- Task-related records performed by Oracle Utilities Customer Care and Billing to manage specific processing, such as net
energy metering true-ups, or prepaid billing to create bill segments for smart meter prepaid service agreements.

For additional information about Service Tasks, see Defining Service Tasks Options

###### Searching and Viewing Service Tasks

**3. Click Refresh.**

**4. In the search results list, click the link for the service task you want to view or edit. The selected service task opens in**
the Service Task portal.

##### Registration Points


-----

###### Understanding Registration Points

Deregulated markets operate by passing transactions between market participants to manage market processes. Markets use
a unique market identifier for market participants to identify the customer or premise that the transaction applies to.

Some markets will identify a customer at a premise and the unique identifier will change with each new customer at the
same premise. Other markets will identify the premise as the unique identifier and all customers at that premise will use the
same identifier.

A registration point can manage a unique identifier at the premise level, service point level or the service agreement level.
Therefore, providing the ability to operate in all markets.

Registration points can be associated directly with market transactions and/or market processes. Transactions can
be implemented to trigger from changes to a registration point, or any object associated with the registration point.
Transactions from Market Participants are received and validated against the registration point and can update the
registration point directory or associated objects.

A registration point search portal provides a central location for all transactions associated with a customer and/or premise
to be viewed in a single location.

For implementations operating in deregulated markets, refer to your implementation documentation for further details
relating to registration point(s) constructed for your market(s).

Refer to Understanding Market for more details on markets.

###### Maintaining Registration Points

This portal is used to display and maintain a Registration Point.

Refer to Understanding Registration Points for more details.

To view and maintain registration points, open Menu > Customer Information > Registration Point > Search. You are
brought to a query portal with options for searching for registration points.

- **Registration Point Relationships**

Refer to the zones’ embedded help for more information.

##### Consumer Contracts

###### Maintaining Consumer Contracts

This portal is used to display and maintain a Consumer Contract.


-----

Refer to Understanding Consumer Contracts for more details.

To view and maintain consumer contracts, open Menu > Customer Information > Consumer Contract > Search. You
are brought to a query portal with options for searching for consumer contracts.

Once a consumer contract record has been selected, you are brought to the maintenance portal to view and maintain the
selected record.

The following zones are displayed:

- **Consumer Contract shows the details of the consumer contract.**

- **Consumer Contract Milestone shows the significant dates on which specific actions will take place for the consumer**
contract.

- **Consumer Contract Product shows the related contract product versions**

- **Consumer Contract Change Request shows the related consumer contract change request(s) that created and/or**
updated the consumer contract.

Refer the zones’ embedded help for more information.

##### Customer Service Requests

###### Understanding Customer Service Requests

Customer service requests can be used to orchestrate complex customer related processes that can create or update multiple
objects.

- Customer service request person

- Customer service request account

- Customer service request premise

- Customer service request service agreement

- Customer service request consumer contracts

- Customer service request contract product

- Customer service request service location

An implementation can add custom components to use the customer service request objects to add or update persons,
accounts, premises and contracts.

To see the available customer service request types in your implementation, refer to the Customer Service Request business
objects in the application.

###### About Starting, Stopping and Transferring Service Using Customer Service Requests

The system is delivered with step-by-step processes to facilitate start, stopping and transferring service. A few different
objects are used to comprise these processes. These objects are designed to work with each other – like a matched set.

A Process Flow Type controls the user experience by combining a series of panels that create the steps of the flow. The
process flow guides the user to gather information based on configured business rule. It also orchestrates performing
business logic contained in plug-in spots to progress the process flow. For example, it uses a chosen premise to then


-----

show the user the available services to start at that premise. Along the way, the process flow creates and interacts with an
underlying transaction.

A Customer Service Request is a lifecycle-based transaction that is created by the process flow. The customer service
request is comprised of a parent request and child objects to record, update, and provide processing for persons, accounts,
service agreements, and premises. The customer service request lifecycle continues after the process flow is complete and
until all associated services are activated, stopped, or canceled.

A Customer Service Request Type contains the business rules that the process flow and customer service request jointly
interpret, apply, and enforce. The customer service request type’s business rules settings are called controls. They along
with the plug-in spots, define the type’s behavior. Some configuration is used by the process flow and some by the customer
service request. For example, the customer service request type has controls that impact the fields used to search for a
person and a plug-in spot used to create pending start service agreements.

###### The Start Service Process and Request

When starting service, the system creates a start service process flow and assigns it a customer service request type. The
process flow type (start service process) and customer service request type (start service request type or request type) are
determined from the action method with Action Method Role of Start Service. See Action Method for more information
about setting up action methods. The customer service (start service) request parent and child business objects are defined
on the request type.

The system is delivered with the following objects that are used to start service

- Process Flow Type C1-STARTSERVICEREQUEST.

- Customer Service Request Type business object C1-StartServiceRequestType

- Customer Service Request business object C1-StartServiceRequest

- Customer Service Request Person business object C1-CustSvcRequestPerson

- Customer Service Request Account business object C1-CustSvcRequestAccount

- Customer Service Request Premise business object C1-CustSvcRequestPremise

- Customer Service Request Start SA business object C1-StartServiceRequestSA

The start service process can be initiated via BPA script (refer to script C1StaActMtdR).

###### Start Service Process

The start service process contains five steps or panels. The logic that is enabled is defined in the request type. The following
overview of the four panels assumes the request type has enabled the described functionality. This is meant to illustrate
the full features provided with the start service process. The request type can be configured to accommodate your business
rules.

**Move-to Premise Address. This panel is used to search for the starting premise. This is the first step to ensure that the new**
or existing customer’s Move-to Premise Address exists and is in your service territory.

**Customer Identification. This panel is used to create a new person and/or account or ensure a person’s existing account**
is eligible for service. If the start service process began without an existing person in context, a person search is provided
to ensure the person is in fact not in your system to help prevent creating duplicate person records. If no person is found,
the information used to search for the person such as their name, phone number, or ID is used to create a new person. If an
existing person is found, the start process then continues as if the person was provided when the process began.

Regardless if an existing person is being used or a new person is being added, the start process determines if a credit or ID
check needs to be performed and if it does, performs it. It then checks to see if the person has accounts that are eligible for
service. For example, accounts used for bankruptcy or accounts that have been dormant for too long might not be eligible
for service. A control determines if a new account can be created even if an existing account is eligible for service. This is
useful to prevent duplicate accounts for the same person, unless your business rules allow it. The start process then uses the


-----

previous information to determine if a deposit is required. For more information, please see Verifying Identity, Checking
Credit and Requiring Deposits when Starting Service.

Before transitioning to the next panel, this panel interacts with the start service request to create person and account records.
When a new person or account is added, their record will exist in the system after this point, even if this process is not
completed.

**Services to Start. On this panel the services to start are selected. After inputting a start date, the panel displays services to**
start in three different groupings.

If a deposit is required, the first sections is shown. The start process defaults the deposit service agreement request type,
calls the deposit calculation plug-in spot on deposit class, and defaults installments information amounts if configured on
the request type. The start process enforces rules pertaining to installment amounts. While not common, additional deposit
SAs can be added.

The next section shows the eligible services to start at the premise. This is based on the premise’s SPs. This section is
built by calling the algorithm in configured in the Determine Services to Start plug-in spot defined on the request type.
It returns the default SA Type(s) for each service point based on the existing or prior service or the initial services defined
on the SP Type if this is the first service at this SP. The start SA box is usually checked by default and can be unchecked
to start only some of the eligible services at the premise. In rare cases, the start SA box is unchecked by default if some
services are on and some services are off at the premise. This is done to replicate the current service at the premise by
default. Entries cannot be removed or added to this collection of eligible services to start. Field service notes can be entered
for the premise or service point.

The third service section is where additional services such as charity can be started. Additional services can default from the
request type or be added. The search is designed to exclude deposit and SP-based services shown in the prior sections.

At the end of the panel, premise attributes such as indicating if life support equipment is at the premise or if there are
specific field warnings relevant to the premise.

**Person and Account Details. This panel is where all other person and account information is gathered. This includes all**
person contact information, other names, other person identifies, alternate mailing address, paperless billing enrollment,
autopay enrollment and updates, adding other persons on the account, and more.

**Review and Submit. This panel provides an opportunity to review the information before submission.**

When the start process is finished, a Summary is shown. The start service information is copied to the start service parent
and child requests. The start service process is completed, and the start service request takes over.

###### Start Service Request

The start service request lifecycle is comprised of this logic:

- The start service request first checks to see if there are pre-requites to starting service. See Introducing Your Business
Rule Before Starting or Transferring Service.

- Once any prerequisites have been completed, the request applies any person and account updates gathered during the
start service flow. It then creates the pending start SAs by calling the algorithm plugged into the Process Services to
**Start plug-in spot on the request type.**

- The request then monitors the pending SAs for activation.

- Once all services are active, premise updates are applied.

- The start request is then complete.

**NOTE:** For more details, see the start service request business object detailed description.

###### The Stop Service Process and Request

When stopping service, the system creates a stop service process flow and assigns it a customer service request type. The
process flow type (stop service process) and customer service request type (stop service request type or request type) are


-----

determined from the action method with Action Method Role of Stop Service. See Action Method for more information
about setting up action methods. The customer service (stop service) request parent and child business objects are defined
on the request type..

The system is delivered with the following objects that are used to stop service

- Process Flow Type C1-STOPSERVICEREQUEST.

- Customer Service Request Type business object C1-StopServiceRequestType

- Customer Service Request business object C1-StopServiceRequest

- Customer Service Request Person business object C1-CustSvcRequestPerson

- Customer Service Request Account business object C1-CustSvcRequestAccount

- Customer Service Request Premise business object C1-CustSvcRequestPremise

- Customer Service Request Start SA business object C1-StopServiceRequestSA

The stop service process can be initiated via BPA script (refer to script C1StpActMtdR).

###### Stop Service Process

The stop service process contains three steps or panels. The logic that is enabled is defined in the request type. The
following overview of the two panels assumes the request type has enabled the described functionality. This is meant to
illustrate the full features provided with the stop service process. The request type can be configured to accommodate your
business rules.

**Services to Stop. This panel is used to choose the services to stop for the account. After entering a stop date, the algorithm**
in configured in the Determine Services to Stop plug-in spot defined on the request type is called. It returns the stoppable
services for the account. The services at the premise in context are selected to stop by default. Other premises and nonpremise-based service can also be selected to stopped but are not selected by default. Non-premise-based services with a
characteristic premise matching the premise in context are defaulted to stop.

Field service notes can be entered for the premise or service point where service is being stopped.

Additionally, as customers stop service at a premise, some premise attributes such as indicating if life support equipment is
at the premise or if there are specific field warnings relevant to the premise may need to be updated. Premise updates can be
made for any premise where service is being stopped.

**Person and Account Details. This panel has the same features as the same panel in the Start Service Process. The options**
presented are controlled by the stop request type

**Review and Submit. This panel provides an opportunity to review the information before submission.**

When the stop service process is finished, a Summary is shown. The stop service information is copied to the stop service
parent and child requests. The stop service process is completed, and the stop service request takes over.

###### Stop Service Request

The stop service request lifecycle is comprised of this logic:

- The stop service request applies any person and account updates gathered during the stop service flow. Services that are
chosen to stop are transitioned to pending stop by the algorithm plugged into the Process Services to Stop plug-in spot
on the request type.

- The request then monitors the pending stop SAs to check when they have stopped.

- Once all services are stopped, the request applies any premise updates.

- The stop request is then complete.

**NOTE:** For more details, see the stop service request business object detailed description.


-----

###### The Transfer Service Process and Request

When transferring service (starting and stopping service for the same customer), the system creates a transfer service
process flow and assigns it a customer service request type. The process flow type (transfer service process) and customer
service request type (transfer service request type or request type) are determined from the action method with Action
Method Role of Transfer Service. See Action Method for more information about setting up action methods. The customer
service (transfer service) request parent and child business objects are defined on the request type.

The system is delivered with the following objects that are used to transfer service:

- Process Flow Type C1-TRANSFERSERVICEREQUEST.

- Customer Service Request Type business object C1-TransferServiceRequestType

- Customer Service Request business object C1-TransferServiceRequest

- Customer Service Request Person business object C1-CustSvcRequestPerson

- Customer Service Request Account business object C1-CustSvcRequestAccount

- Customer Service Request Premise business object C1-CustSvcRequestPremise

- Customer Service Request Start SA business object C1-StartServiceRequestSA

- Customer Service Request Stop SA business objectC1-StopServiceRequestSA

The transfer service process can be initiated via BPA script (refer to script C1TrnActMtdR).

###### Transfer Service Process

The transfer service process contains five steps or panels. The logic that is enabled is defined in the request type. The
transfer process combines panels from the start and stop processes into one process.

**Move-to Premise Address. This panel is the same as the same panel used in the Start Service Process.**

**Services to Start. This panel is the same as the same panel used in the Start Service Process. The options presented are**
controlled by the transfer request type.

**Services to Stop. This panel is the same as the same panel used in the Stop Service Process. The options presented are**
controlled by the transfer request type.

**Person and Account Details. This panel is similar to the same panel in the Start and Stop Service Processes. The only**
notable difference is that this panel allows for the creation of a customer contact for the starting and stopping service. The
options presented are controlled by the transfer request type.

**Review and Submit. This panel provides an opportunity to review the information before submission.**

When the transfer service process is finished, a Summary is shown. The transfer service information is copied to the
transfer service parent and child requests. The transfer service process is completed, and the transfer service request takes
over.

###### Transfer Service Request

The transfer service request lifecycle is comprised of this logic:

- The transfer service request first checks to see if there are pre-requites to starting service. See Introducing Your Business
Rule Before Starting or Transferring Service.

- Once any prerequisites have been completed, the request applies any person and account updates gathered during the
transfer service flow. It then creates the pending start SAs by calling the algorithm plugged into the Process Services
**to Start plug-in spot on the request type. Next it creates the pending stop SAs by calling the algorithm plugged into the**
**Process Services to Stop plug-in spot on the request type.**

- The request then monitors the pending start SAs for activation and the pending stop SAs for stopping.


-----

- The move-to premise is updated as soon as one of its SAs are Active. Each move-from premise is updated as soon as one
of its SAs are Stopped.

- The transfer request is completed when all of the following are true:

  - All premises are updated

  - All SAs to start are Active

  - All SAs to stop are Stopped.

**NOTE:** For more details, see the transfer service request business object detailed description.

###### Additional Information About the Start, Stop, and Transfer Processes

The following explains some of the more intricate details performed during the start, stop, and transfer processes.

###### Override Mailing Address

By default, the main person on an account’s mailing address source is the mailing premise on the account. Other person’s
on the account do not default the address source and one must be chosen. Aside from the mailing premise on the account,
the system stores a mailing address information on the person and directly on the account person record, which is called
Account Override. The account/person record indicates the address source for that account/person.

Your business rules may define where alternate mailing addresses are stored or when each is used. The request type defines
which alternate location is used or if both are used. When adding an alternate mailing address, the address is stored in the
preferred location or if both are enabled, Person or Account Override must be selected.

Existing data might not reflect your current business rules. For example, the request type is set to Account Override, but
the address source is already set to Person. In this case, the process behaves as if both sources are enabled and a message
is shown to indicate that the current address is stored in the source not supported by the request type. The process does not
require the source to be changed.

###### Default Bill Route Type

When a new person and account are added or when a new person is linked to an account as an other person, the bill route
type is defaulted from the installation record.

###### Paperless Billing

The processes allow customers to enroll in paperless billing if not already enrolled. If the current bill route type’s routing
method is email or fax, the customer is considered already enrolled. When enrolling, the bill route type defined on the
request type is used.

###### Autopay Enrollment

The processes allow customers to enroll, check, or stop automatic payments. If enrolled, the details of the current record
are shown. Changing the enrollment expires the currently effective and creates a new record effective the following day. To

#### Asset Management

**NOTE:** The asset management functionality described in this section is available only to cloud implementations using
Oracle Utilities Customer Cloud Service or Oracle Utilities Meter Solution Cloud Service.

##### Assets

###### About Assets

In Oracle Utilities Customer To Meter, an asset is any operational device used in a metering system, such as a smart meter,
analog meter, communication component, or communication relay.

The status and location of assets are carefully monitored and recorded as they move in and out of service or go for
maintenance or repair. This type of asset will be tracked at a location with a disposition such as in receipt, in stores, in
repair, retired or rejected. If the tracked asset is installed, or put in service, it will be related to an asset location. Tracked
assets utilize more statuses and a status reason to more carefully track the asset as it moves from receipt to retirement.

Assets are defined by the following:

- **Asset Type: The asset type on which the asset is based.**

- **Status: The current status of the asset (In Receipt, In Stores, Installed, In Repair, Retired, Rejected, or Pending**
Disposition)

- **Device: The device associated with the asset. When assets are created (either manually or through asset replication), a**
corresponding device is created (see Assets and Devices below for more information).

- **Specification: The asset’s specification. This is used to determine the template device used when creating devices based**
on the asset or its asset type.

- **Identification: Identifiers (such as Badge Number or Serial Number) and other information used to identify the asset**


-----

- **Settings: Firmware and configuration settings used with smart meter assets**

- **Asset Disposition Detail: Details regarding the disposition and location of the asset.**

**NOTE:** The Asset portal may display information beyond that described here that is not used with Oracle Utilities
Customer To Meter.

###### Components

Components are devices or other objects that are attached to another device, usually an asset.

One of the most common examples of components are the electronic reading devices (ERTs) that are often attached to
analog meters. However, a component can be any asset attached to another asset.

Example of components in Oracle Utilities Customer To Meter include:

- **Communication Relays: Communication relays transmit messages between various points to facilitate communication**
between units. These typically use the same fields and statuses as meters.

- **Communication Components: Communication components are devices that can be attached to an analog meter to**
connect the meter to the “smart” communication grid. These use the same fields and statuses as smart meters with the
exception that they are never installed directly at a location, but are instead attached to another asset.

Since they are always attached to another device, components cannot be installed at a location. However, they may be
received, tracked, maintained and inspected like any other device. Given this, activities and work orders can be created to
perform these tasks on components.

Detaching components involves either moving the component to a new asset or transferring to a storeroom. The process
within the system is to search for and select the component and then "detach" it from the asset where it currently resides.

###### Asset Hierarchy

Assets typically exist within a structured relationship based on the relationship between the asset and its locations and
organizations, or “nodes”. The hierarchy is represented in a nested format on the Tree View tab on the Asset portal. This
view displays which assets are in a location, which assets are attached to other assets, and where assets belong within
organizations. Clicking the broadcast icon next to any element within the tree displays a list of assets and components
related to that element in the hierarchy. Clicking the actual link for an element navigates to the associated record for the
element.

###### Assets and Devices

When assets are created (or replicated) in Oracle Utilities Meter To Customer, a related device is created. The way in which
the device is created is based on the configuration of the asset, its asset type, and its specification.

- For assets with specifications that include Configuration Mapping details, the type of device created is based on
the template device identified in the Configuration Mapping section of the specification referenced on the asset or
associated with the asset type.

- For assets that have no template device configured, the type of device created is based on the asset type of the asset
and the Value Mappings defined for the “Asset Type/Device Type” value of the ODM-MDM Mapping Field Values
extendable lookup.

Device identifiers for devices created via an asset can not be changed in the Device portal. These identifiers must be
changed in the Asset portal.

**NOTE:** If an asset is deleted, its related device is also deleted.

###### Asset Status and Disposition

An asset’s Status defines it’s current state in the system (In Receipt, In Stores, Installed, In Repair, Retired, Rejected, or
Pending Disposition).


-----

An asset’s Disposition indicates where the asset is and what is being done to the asset. This includes its status and location,
as well as the date/time at which the asset was moved to its current location. In the case of components, disposition is also
used to track the assets to which a component is attached.

The Mass Asset Disposition Update portal can be used for moving many assets of the same type from one location to
another location.

The disposition of assets with related devices is updated to “Installed” when their related device is installed at a service
point. The update to the device’s install event triggers the update to the asset disposition, changing its Status and Asset
**Disposition to “Installed” and its Location to the service point with an effective date matching the install event’s**
**Installation Date/Time.**

**Pre-Assembled Meters**
Assets received with communication modules already attached are known as “pre-assembled meters”. When a preassembled meter asset is installed at a service point, the attachment date and time of the equipment, which is effectively
the device installation date and time, will not be reflected on the asset component. This means that the asset component
retains the original attachment date time upon its receipt and storage. Subsequent online user actions such as updating the
attachment date and time deleting equipment deletion from the device (undo attachment), are also not reflected on the asset
component.

However, removing the meter from the service point is considered the same as detaching equipment and is are reflected
on the asset component, regardless of whether the equipment is physically detached from the meter in the field or not.
Recording the equipment detachment in this manner is done to support potential equipment reuse on a replacement meter.

##### Asset Activities


-----

###### About Asset Activities

Asset activities are used for creating field work tasks related to an asset or asset location, such as installation or removal of
a meter to and from its service point. It may also be used for creating field work tasks for a specific location unrelated to an
asset such as trimming trees near power lines, fixing a street light pole, repairing fire hydrant leaks, and so on.

The base package includes an asset activity type business object (W1-SOMActivityType) and a corresponding asset activity
business object (W1-SOMActivity), used in the integration or consolidation of Operational Device Management activities
with and Service Order Management activities related to field work.

When an asset activity (based on the asset activity type and asset activity business objects referenced above) is created and
enters the “Communication in Progress” state, the activity is synchronized with Service Order Management, creating a
service order field activity with a field task type that corresponds to the asset activity’s type.

Once the field activity has been created, Service Order Management is responsible for dispatching the request to the field
work system. When the task is completed, Service Order Management receives the completion information from the
field work system, completes the service order field activity and sends the completion information to Operational Device
Management to complete the corresponding asset activity.

Asset activities (based on the (W1-SOMActivity business object) are defined by:

- **Status: The current status of the asset activity**

- **Emergency: A flag that indicates if the asset activity is an emergency or nor**

- **Originating Activity: The activity that triggered the creation of the asset activity (if applicable)**

- **Location: The location where the asset activity is to be performed**

- **Asset: The asset associated with the asset activity**

- **Activity Generator: The asset activity generator that created the asset activity (if applicable)**

- **Service Date/Time: The date and time at which the field work associated with the asset activity is to be performed**

- **Address Information: The address where the field work associated with the asset activity is to be performed**

- **Contact Information: Contact information (customer name and phone number) related to the asset activity**

###### Maintaining Asset Activities

**Activity portal to view and maintain the selected record. See About Service Order Field Activities for more information.**

##### Asset Activity Generators

###### About Asset Activity Generators

Asset activity generators are used for mass generation of activities. An Asset Generator Criteria business object is
selected when creating asset activity generators, and is used for entering the criteria values for searching assets and asset
locations that will be linked to the activities to be created. Such criteria includes location type, asset identifiers, location
identifiers, address components, asset disposition, indication if asset is installed or not, asset type, specification and among
others. Required information also includes, the activity type, disposition of the created activities, maximum number of
activities that will be created, and an indication if the activities will be created via batch processing.

The base package the following set of activity generator business objects containing the various criteria:

- **Asset Criteria (W1–AssetCriteriaActGenerator): used to define asset-related criteria used to select the assets for which**
activities will be created (for example, activities for all assets for a certain asset type, a specified current disposition or
condition, or whose identifiers contain specific characters, and so on)

- **Asset List (W1–AssetListActGenerator): used to define a list of assets for which activities will be created**

- **Component Criteria (W1–CompnCriteriaActGenerator): used to define component-related criteria to select the**
components for which activities will be created (for example, asset inspection activities for all assets for a certain
component type, a specified current disposition or condition, or whose identifiers contain specific characters, and so on)

- **Component List (W1–CompnAssetListActGenerator): used to define a list of assets for which activities will be created**

- **Location Criteria (W1–NodeCriteriaActGenerator): used to define location-related criteria to select the asset locations**
for which activities will be created (for example, activities for all locations where assets are current installed, locations of
a specific type, or whose identifiers contain specific characters, and so on)


Asset activity generators are defined by:

- **Status: The current status of the asset activity generator**

- **Batch Generation Requested: A flag that indicates if the activities created by the asset activity generator should be**
generated via batch processing

##### Asset Locations

###### About Asset Locations

Asset locations define the physical location where an asset is installed. In Oracle Utilities Customer To Meter, asset
locations are service points, and specify the address where a device is installed.

In Oracle Utilities Customer To Meter, asset locations are created when a service point is created, and are maintained using
the Service Point portal. If the service point has a contact associated with it, a corresponding contact will be created for the
asset location. See About Contacts and Maintaining Contacts for more information about creating and maintaining contacts
used with asset locations.

Note that an asset location is the physical location where assets or components can be installed, whereas Out of Service
Locations are for receipt, storage, repair, retirement, transport (on vehicles) and other dispositions.

###### Maintaining Asset Locations

You use the Asset Location portal is used to search for asset locations.

Refer to About Asset Locations for additional information about asset locations.

You can access the Asset Location portal from Menu > Asset Management > Asset Location. You are brought to a query

location. See About Contacts and Maintaining Contacts for more information about creating and maintaining contacts
used with asset locations.

##### Asset Replication

###### About Asset Replication

As devices and other assets are received in large quantities, the Asset Replication portal allows for the receipt, inspection,
storage and other processing of these assets in batches.

Using asset replication functionality your organization can complete processes such as:

- Replicating assets in the same lot/pallet

- Selecting assets for testing or inspection

- Mass updating asset disposition such as rejecting or accepting a lot or pallet

This processing creates new asset IDs, badge numbers and serial numbers for assets based on general information that is
entered related to each batch. When a new replication event is created it is tied to a replication activity type to determine
default settings and attributes for the replication. The actual asset information can be entered manually or uploaded via a
CSV file.

Assets can then be moved between locations, or dispositioned using Mass Asset Disposition Update.

###### Maintaining Asset Replication

#### Device Management

##### Devices

###### About Meters

Meters are a type of device, which can be physical or virtual objects, that can produce data to be handled by the system.

A meter can have one or more device configurations over time. A meter's measuring components (if applicable) are
associated with the device via device configurations.

A meter's device category (defined as an option on the device's business object) defines the broad category to which a
particular device belongs. This option is used by smart meter commands and other processes when determining how
the system should behave when executing processes based on the category of device. For example, when viewing items
via the Device portal, certain item-specific zones appear that are not displayed when viewing meters or communication
components. The base package supports the following device categories for meters:


-----

- **Smart Meter: these meters are associated to a head end system and support smart meter commands. The measuring**
components associated to these devices are expected to be read very frequently. These meters support periodic
estimation.
Refer to About Periodic Estimation for additional functional information about how the periodic estimation can fill in
missing reads for both interval and scalar measuring components.

- **AMR Meter: these meters may also be associated to a head end system but they do not support smart meter commands.**
The measuring components are read frequently.

- **Manual Meter: these meters are seldom read and do not support smart meter commands.**

Attributes used to define devices include the following:

- Basic information about the Device including type of device (Smart Meter, Manual Meter, and so on), Manufacturer, and
Model

- One or more device identifiers such as serial number, badge number, meter number, etc.

- For smart meters the device can also specify a head end system and an incoming data shift. Note: these fields are only
necessary when there is no fallback defined on the device type.

Refer to Initial Measurement Data for additional functional information about how the device's head end system and
incoming data shift can impact processing.

###### About Communication Modules

Communication modules enable automatic meter reading for manual meters, and handle electronic transmission of
measurement data and events for meters that are not capable or not enabled to handle this data. Devices of this sort are
attached to manual meters as equipment, and in the case of modules that measure consumption or other data, are associated
to the physical meter’s scalar measuring components.

Communication modules associated with a manual meter are defined in the Device Equipment list on the Manual Meter
business object (D1-ManualMeter). See the embedded help for more information.

**Creating Measuring Components for Communication Modules**
Measuring components used with communication modules must be scalar register measuring components (based on the D1Register business object) and must be defined on the manual meter's device configuration.

If the communication modules will also record interval consumption, create an interval channel measuring component
(based on the D1-IntervalChannel business object) add it to the manual meter's device configuration, and add it as the
register measuring component’s Consumption Reference Measuring Component.

**Measurement and Device Event Processing for Communication Modules**
The IMD Seeder and Device Event Seeder support payloads that reference the communication module identifiers currently
attached to a physical meter, instead of the physical meter's identifier.

Based on the physical meter and the communication module currently attached to it, the seeders can identify the physical
meter’s register (or related interval) measuring component and use it for instantiating the initial measurement or device
event.

###### Devices and Characteristics

Characteristics can be defined for devices using the Device Characteristics zone on the Device portal. Only characteristics
of types defined for the device’s type in the Valid Device Characteristic Types zone on the Device Type portal can be
defined for the device.


-----

###### About Items

While the most common type of devices are meters, there are many other devices that can be involved with a customer's
service. These other devices are referred to simply as "items", and are used to represent lamps, poles, current transformers,
backflow devices, pulse initiators, etc.

Items can be either "badged" or "unbadged". "Badged" items are those that have unique identifiers, and are represented by
device records. Device records are not created for "unbadged" items. "Badged" items are installed at service points in much
the same way as meters are installed (though they use an item-specific install event). For "unbadged" items, "multi-item"
service points are used to define the number of each type of item that is installed at the service point.

These "badged" items are not directly measured and therefore do not have a measuring component. Instead there is
configuration on the device type that will identify an effective dated average daily usage. Using the average daily usage the
item's consumption will be calculated. The total consumption for a given period will always be equal to the average daily
usage multiplied by the duration of the period. However, when the consumption for a period is turned into an interval curve
there are two ways this can be done:

- **Use Straight Line: the consumption will be evenly divided amongst the intervals (thus producing a straight line when**
graphed)

- **Use Profile: a profile measuring component will be used to align the consumption to a curve. This is useful because it**
can more accurately identify the hours where consumption has occurred.

Refer to About Service Points for additional functional information about "unbadged" items.

###### About Communication Components

Communication components are devices attached to meters. A communication component may handle electronic
transmission of measurement data, events, and commands in situations in which the underlying meter is not capable or not
enabled to handle this data. Devices of this sort are sometimes referred to as ERT (Electronic Receiver/Transmitter) meters,
or communication modules (for example, the term "gas module" may refer to a communication module attached to a gas
meter).

###### Maintaining Devices

This portal is used to display and maintain a Device.

Refer to About Meters, About Items, and About Communication Components for additional functional information.

##### Device Configurations

###### About Device Configurations

Device configurations represent specific configurations of a device as of a certain time.

Over time, a device can have many configurations. Device configurations are effective-dated allowing a device to retain its
identifiers (such as serial number, badge number, etc.) even while the quantities it measures change over time.

Each device configuration can have one or more measuring components associated with it.

Attributes used to define device configurations include the following:

- The device configuration type

- The parent device

- The effective date and time of the device configuration

- The time zone in which the device operates

Refer to Multi Time Zone Support for additional information on the importance of the Device Configuration time zone.

###### Maintaining Device Configurations

You use the Device Configuration portal to maintain device configurations.

Refer to About Device Configuration for additional functional information.

You can access the portal from Menu > Device > Device Configuration. You are brought to a query portal with options for
searching. Once your record has been selected you are brought to the maintenance portal to view and maintain the selected
record.

This portal includes the following zones:

- **Device Configuration: Defines the basic attributes of the device configuration**

- **Measuring Components: Lists the measuring components for the device configuration**


-----

- **Scalar Readings: Displays a list of scalar readings for scalar measuring components associated with the current device**
configuration. To create a new reading for scalar measuring components associated with the device configuration, click
**New Reading. To edit an existing reading, click the edit icon for the reading you wish to edit.**

**NOTE: The Scalar Readings zone is available only with Oracle Utilities Meter Data Management.**

##### Measuring Components

###### About Measuring Components

Measuring components are single points for which data will be received and stored in the system.

A measuring component can be associated to a device, which can have one or more measuring components, or it can be
"virtual" or "stand-alone," meaning that it is not associated to a device.

The base package supports the following types of measuring components:

- **Physical: Physical measuring components are those that physically exist, and that are linked to a device that can be**
configured differently over time. Interval channels and scalar registers are examples of physical measuring components.
Note: The terms register and channel are synonyms for measuring component.

- **Standalone: A standalone measuring component is used to record measurements for something that does not have a**
physical presence or is not associated to a particular device or service point. For example, you might create a standalone
measuring component to record the average daily temperature supplied by a weather station. Standalone measuring
components can be identified through Standalone Identifier.

- **Scratchpad: Users create scratchpad measuring components based on physical measuring components to experiment**
with measurement manipulation functions.

- **Aggregator: An aggregator measuring component holds summarized usage from other measuring components. For**
example, aggregator measuring components could be configured to hold total consumption for each postal code within
a service territory. Head end system processing statistics used by Oracle Utilities Smart Grid Gateway are stored as
aggregated measurements for aggregator measuring components.
Refer to About Aggregations for additional functional information about aggregation measuring components.

Attributes used to define measuring components can include the following:

- The measuring component type

- The device configuration to which the measuring component is associated

- Details concerning how the measuring component is read, such as the number of digits, the type of read out (dials or
digital), the meter multiplier, etc.

- The VEE groups used for validation and estimation of measurement data.
Refer to About VEE for details about the types of VEE groups supported.

###### Scalar vs. Interval

Beyond the four types described above, measuring components generally fall into one of two primary classes of: scalar
measuring components, and interval measuring components.

- **Scalar measuring components are measured at unpredictable intervals. For example, "once a month" is not a**
predictable interval as the amount of time between reads in unpredictable and inconsistent.

- **Interval measuring components are measured at predictable intervals, such as every 15 minutes, every 30 minutes,**
every hour, etc.

- The terms "interval size" and "seconds-per-interval" (SPI) are used to define the size of an interval measuring
component's intervals.


-----

- Note: A device may have any combination of interval and/or scalar measuring components

###### Measuring Component Measurements

Measuring components are configured to measure specific types of quantities. These include:

- **Unit of Measure: The unit of measure for the quantity being recorded. Examples include kilo-watt hours (kWh), kilo-**
watts (kW), therms, cubic feet (CCF), temperature (Fahrenheit or Celsius), etc.

- **Time of Use: Modifiers for a given unit of measure that indicate a period of time during which a quantity has been**
used, such as On-Peak (meaning during a time when the greatest quantity of some consumable is being used), Off-Peak
(meaning during a time when the least amount of some consumable is being used), etc.

- **Service Quantity Identifiers: Used to further distinguish between measured quantities that have identical UOM/TOU**
combinations, including situations in which the distinguishing identifier of a UOM is not accurately described as a TOU.
Generally, SQI is only used when multiple measuring components measure the same thing, but in different ways. A
meter that measures both generation KWH and consumption KWH could use SQIs to differentiate between the two.

The combination of UOM, TOU and SQI define what a measuring component measures. TOU and SQI are optional, but
UOM must be defined for all measuring components. For example, consider a meter (as illustrated in the image below) with
two measuring components, both measuring the same unit of measure (kWh), but each measuring component measures
consumption in different time of use (TOU) periods (peak and off-peak).

###### Subtractive vs. Consumptive Measurements

Another attribute that defines how measuring components measure quantities is the distinction between subtractive and
consumptive measuring components.

A subtractive measuring component's usage is equal to the current reading (also known as the Stop or End Measurement or
Reading) minus the previous reading (also known as the Start Measurement or Reading). To put this more simply:

Usage = End Reading - Start Reading

Most residential scalar meters are subtractive and in some cases interval meters can be subtractive as well . The table below
lists a series of measurements for a subtractive measuring component.

**Date** **kWh (Reading)** **Usage**

01/01/2010 0

01/31/2010 1000 1000 kWh

03/02/2010 1780 780 kWh

04/01/2010 2700 920 kWh

A consumptive measuring component's usage is equal to its current measurement. Most residential interval meters are
subtractive. For scalar, consumptive measuring components are often used to measure demand, such as KW. The table
below lists a series of measurements for a consumptive scalar measuring component.

**Date** **KW (Reading)** **Usage**

01/01/2010 0 0 KW

01/31/2010 10 10 KW

03/02/2010 10 10 KW

04/01/2010 13 13 KW

###### Physical Measuring Components

Physical measuring components are associated to the meters installed at service points. Through a device configuration
there can be one-to-many measuring components in place at a given point in time. Much like other measuring components
these are either scalar or interval and either consumptive or subtractive.

**NOTE:** Refer to About Measuring Components for additional information about scalar versus interval and consumptive
versus subtractive measuring components.

The base product supports a core set of physical measuring components, as described in the following sections.

###### Interval Channel

These measuring components represent consumptive data that is recorded on a regular and consistent frequency as defined
by the interval size. By definition interval data must fall on a specific interval boundary. For example, a meter that receives
data once per hour cannot have a measurement at 1:30. Rather, the data must fall on either 1:00 or 2:00 not in between.

Data for interval channels is expected to be contiguous. However, in situations where it is not, there is no impact to
the calculation of those intervals subsequent to the missing intervals. This is because the calculation of each interval is
independent to all other intervals.

If there is a gap in the intervals it can be estimated through the periodic estimation process.

###### Interval Channel - Subtractive

These measuring components have behavior characteristics of both interval channels and registers. Like the interval
channel they receive data on a regular and consistent frequency that is expected to be contiguous. Like a register they use a
subtractive consumption calculation and provide rollover validation.

Unlike the interval channel when there are missing intervals there is an impact on the calculation of those intervals
subsequent to the missing intervals. This is because the calculation of a given interval is always computed by subtracting its
reading from the last known prior reading. The following table describes an example of that scenario:

**Date/Time** **Reading Condition** **Reading** **Measurement Condition** **Usage**

01/01/2010 12:00AM Regular 0 Regular 0 kWh

01/01/2010 01:00AM Regular 10 Regular 10 kWh

01/01/2010 02:00AM Regular 20 Regular 10 kWh

01/01/2010 03:00AM Regular 30 Regular 10 kWh

Missing measurements

1/01/2010 12:00PM Regular 120 Combined Quantity 90 kWh

Notice that the consumption for the 01/01/2010 12:00PM interval has become overloaded and covers the entire period for
which no intervals have had been received. Also take note that the measurement condition is assigned a unique condition of
Combined Quantity to signify that the consumption covers more than one interval.

A similar situation can arise when there has been an underestimation of consumption for a particular meter:

**Date/Time** **Reading Condition** **Reading** **Measurement Condition** **Usage**

01/01/2010 12:00AM Regular 0 Regular 0 kWh

01/01/2010 01:00AM System Estimate 10 System Estimate 10 kWh

01/01/2010 02:00AM System Estimate 13 System Estimate 3 kWh


-----

01/01/2010 03:00AM System Estimate 16 System Estimate 3 kWh

1/01/2010 04:00AM Regular 40 Estimated 24 kWh

To help avoid these situations where an interval becomes overloaded with usage due to missing or estimated intervals the
subtractive interval channel has the ability to initiate the calculation of missing intervals or re-calculation of estimated
intervals when processing newly received intervals.

**NOTE:** Refer to Understanding Measuring Component Types link for additional information about how to configure
subtractive interval measuring component types to perform prior and subsequent estimation.

###### Register

A register, often referred to as scalar, measuring component is used to represent infrequently received data from a meter.
Typically these types of measuring components will only be read once per month aligning to the billing period for the
customer.

The physical meter these measuring components represent often have dial readings where there are a finite number of digits
that can register the consumption. When the maximum amount has been measured the meter will rollover and start counting
once more from zero. To appropriately handle these scenarios this type of measuring component can be defined with a
rollover tolerance that allows the system to accurately identify an invalid reading from a standard rollover. For example
when a meter has 6 dials (a maximum of 999,999):

- Going from a reading of 999,990 to 20 would likely be valid and represent consumption of 30.

- Whereas going from a reading of 999,990 to 800,000 would be an invalid reading since it would represent consumption
of 810,000.

Given the infrequent nature of these measuring components they are not eligible for the periodic estimation process.

###### Register - Auto-Read

An automatically read register processes nearly identical to a register. The key difference between these two types of
measuring components is that the automatically read variant is expected to be read on a frequency of at least once per day.

These measuring components are eligible for periodic estimation since the information about their reading schedule allows
for missing readings to be detected and estimated.

Given the frequency these meters are read and the nature of subtractive consumption calculation they can be configured
to re-estimate any past or future estimates when actual data has been received. The actual readings allow these estimates
to be refined since the total consumption for the estimated period can be calculated (current reading - last reading prior to
estimation).

**NOTE:** Refer to Periodic Estimation for additional functional information about how the periodic estimation can fill in
missing reads for both interval and scalar measuring components.

###### Scratchpad Measuring Components

Scratchpad measuring components provide users with a means to manipulate "scratchpad" measurement data without
affecting existing "live" measurement data. Examples of measurement manipulation might include experimenting with the
impact of executing the "spike smooth" function on an initial measurement, or adding or removing intervals to or from the
measurement.

Scratchpad measuring components are defined by the same attributes as "regular" measuring components, with the
following additional attributes:

- **User: The name of the user who created the scratchpad. All scratchpad measuring components "belong" to a user.**

- **Source Measuring Component: The measuring component upon which the scratchpad is based.**


-----

Like "regular" measuring components, scratchpad measuring components can be related to a device through a device
configuration, but scratchpad measuring components are not considered "active" for purposes of install events, and are not
used in usage calculations for usage subscriptions.

Like "regular" measuring components, scratchpad measuring components and viewed and maintained using the Measuring
Component portal, and measurement data for scratchpad measuring components can be viewed using the Initial
Measurement portal or the 360 Degree View.

###### Maintaining Measuring Components

You use the Measuring Component portal to maintain measuring components.

Refer to About Measuring Components for additional functional information.

You can access the portal from Menu > Device > Measuring Components. You are brought to a query portal with options
for searching. Once your record has been selected you are brought to the maintenance portal to view and maintain the
selected record.

This portal includes the following zones:

- **Measuring Component: defines the basic attributes of the measuring component**

- **Initial Measurement Data History: lists the last 50 initial measurements for the measuring component in reverse**
chronological order.

- **Measuring Component Profile Use: lists all profile factors on which the measuring component is referenced as a factor**
value.

- **Measurements: lists final measurements for the measuring component, including any derived values for each**
measurement. Note: depending on the type of measuring component this zone may be the Interval, Scalar, or Subtractive
Interval variant.

- **Device Configuration Overview: Displays an overview of the measuring component's parent device's configurations**
over time, including the measuring components associated with each configuration, and service points (along with the
relevant install events) at which the device's configurations have been installed over time, if any exist.

- **Data Requests: Lists data requests for the measuring component. Applicable only for Standalone Data Request**
measuring components (based on the Standalone Data Request MC business object)

- **Measuring Component Comparison Period Details: Lists comparison periods for the measuring component (created**
when the current measuring component is compared to another measuring component via the Interval Proxy Day
Estimation VEE rule)

###### Uploading Measurement Data

Measurement data for a measuring component can be manually uploaded in comma separated values (CSV) format.
This can used to import data from external sources, such as weather systems or other market participants such as system
operators in a settlement market.

This feature is accessed via the Load IMDs (CSV) option on the measuring component’s context menu. When this option is
selected, the Online IMD CSV Upload screen opens. From this screen users can select a CSV file containing measurement
data to upload from a local desktop.

Import files can contain one or more initial measurements For interval data, breaks between initial measurements will
be based on a gap greater than one interval size (SPI) between intervals. For scalar measurements, each row will create a
separate initial measurement.

Refer to the embedded help on this page for details concerning the format of CSV files used for importing measurement
data.


-----

When processed, each initial measurement in the import file results in the creating of an initial measurement for the
measuring component.

###### Requesting Measurement Data

The base package provides a mechanism by which standalone measuring components can request data from an external
application. Examples of this include requesting data weather data from a weather station or zonal load data from
an independent system operator (ISO) when used with Oracle Utilities Market Settlements Management. Measuring
components of this type are referred to as “standalone measuring components”.

###### Standalone Data Request Measuring Components

Requesting measurement data for standalone measuring components is supported by the “Standalone Data Request
MC” (D1-StandaloneDataRequestMC) and “Standalone Data Request MC Type (D1-StandaloneDataRequestMCType)
business objects.

Standalone data request measuring components use many of the same attributes as device-based measuring components, but
also use the following unique parameters:

- **Standalone Identifier: An identifier for the measuring component. This ID is used when importing data for standalone**
measuring components via the standard initial measurement loading process (see About Initial Measurement Data for
more information).

- **Processing Timetable Type: A processing timetable type used when scheduling data requests. If not specified, a**
fallback processing timetable type can be defined on the measuring component’s type.

- **Service Provider: The external application to which data requests are sent. If not specified, a fallback external**
application can be defined on the measuring component’s type.

- **Request Information: Details about the last data request processed for the measuring component**

###### Measurement Data Requests

Requests for measurement data can be scheduled or made manually by a user.

- Scheduled requests are triggered by the “Standalone MC Data Request - Monitor” batch process.

- Manual requests are triggered by clicking the Request Data button in the Record Actions section of the Measuring
**Component zone.**

This opens the Request dialog where te user enters a start and end date/time for the request.

Each of these invokes the “Calculate Schedule and Create Outbound Communication” algorithm which creates an
outbound communication based on the processing method defined for the external application (Service Provider). When the
external application sends back the requested measurement data, it can be received via the standard method for importing
measurement data.

###### Configuring External Applications for Measurement Data Requests

To support measurement data requests, the following processing method must be defined for the external applications to
which data requests are sent:

**Processing Role** **Processing Method**

Standalone MC Data Request How to Send MC Related Information

Used to send the outbound communication to the external application.

**Default Communication Out Business Object: D1-**

StandaloneMCDataRequest (Standalone MC Data Request

-----

**Processing Role** **Processing Method**

The Request Mapping Algorithm and Response Mapping

**Algorithm options can be used to map the format of data both from**

the standard format to an external system format and from an external

system format to the standard format.

For example, when requesting for zonal load from an ISO the process

would be:

                                                - Take the input of an outbound communication that has the

measuring component’s standalone ID and the date/times and put it

into the zonal request format for the ISO

                                                - Take the input of an outbound message that has the response from

the ISO with the intervals and convert it into the IMD format

In addition, the following objects must be configured to send data requests.:

- Communication Type for “Standalone MC Data Request Communication Type”

- External System

- Outbound Message Type

- Message Sender

##### Measuring Component Comparison Periods

###### About Measuring Component Comparison Periods

Measuring component comparison periods are records of measuring component comparison. These are used by the Interval
Proxy Day Estimation VEE rule to compare weather data to identify historical dates that most closely match current and/or
future dates.

Measuring component comparison periods are created by the Interval Proxy Day Estimation rule, and are defined the
following:

- **Primary Measuring Component: The measuring component against which the comparison will be run**

- **End Date / Start Date: The date range that is compared to the period for the Examined Measuring Component**
(defined by the Examined End Date and Examined Start Date)

- **Rank: The rank of this data point relative to the other comparison period stores for the same Measuring Component,**
Comparison Type, and End Date. The lower the rank, the better.

- **Examined Measuring Component: The measuring component that will be compared to the Primary Measuring**
**Component.**

- **Examined End Date / Examined Start Date: The date range that is compared to the period for the Primary Measuring**
Component (defined by the End Date and Start Date)

- **Lowest Quality Condition : The lowest quality of condition code that was found for the measurements in the related**
period.

- **Comparison Metric: The specific metric used to calculate the Comparison Result from the related Comparison Type)**

- **Comparison Result: The value result of the comparison.**


-----

###### Maintaining Measuring Component Comparison Periods

You can access the portal from Menu > Device > Measuring Component Comparison Period. You are brought to a
query portal with options for searching. Once your record has been selected you are brought to the maintenance portal to
view and maintain the selected record.

The following zones may appear as part of the portal's Main tab page:

- **Measuring Component Comparison Period: This zone displays the basic attributes of the measuring component**
comparison period.

#### Device Installations

##### Service Points

###### About Service Points

Service points are physical locations (usually a meter socket) at which a company supplies service and are used in Oracle
Utilities Meter Data Management to store information describing the type of service supplied and how it is measured.
Devices are installed at service points, and the relationship between individual service points and devices can change over
time. For example, over time different devices may be installed at a service point, and a device may be installed at different
service points.

A service point may only have one device. If multiple devices at a service point are required, define a parent and child
service point relationship to create a hierarchy of service points. On each service point, users will be able to specify a parent
service point. An example of this feature would be to link each condominium in a building to a parent service point that
represents the common areas of the building. Another example would be a deregulated service point that allows multiple
devices per service point. In this example, the parent service point would be the market service point ID and the children
service points would relate to the individual devices.

Attributes used to define Service Points can include the following:

- Basic information about the Service Point, including address, time zone, market, parent Service Point (if applicable),
status, and main contact


-----

- Specifics related to whether or not the current Service Point supplies service to life support equipment, or if the load
supplied to the Service Point is considered sensitive

- Information related to field work performed at the current Service Point, including any applicable warnings or
instructions

- The measurement cycle, route, and route sequence for the Service Point

###### Service Point Access via Access Groups and Divisions

Access to service points (and objects and data related to the service point, see below) can be restricted based on Access
Groups and Divisions.

**Restriction via Access Groups**
Service point data access restriction based on Access Group is enabled by default. Users can only access service points (and
related objects and data) with an Access Group associated with the user via Access Role on the Access SecurityAccess
**Security tab of the User Preferences portal. See The Big Picture of Row Security in the Administrative User Guide for**
more information about Access Groups and Access Roles. Restriction via Access Groups applies to all service point queries,
including use of the Service Point Search zone, the Route Management and 360 Search portals, and service point queries
on other zones and portals.

**Restriction via Division**
To enable service point data access restriction based on Division, select "Yes" from the Restrict Division drop-down list in
the Control By Division section of MDM Master Configuration.

When this restriction is in effect, users can only access service points (and related objects and data) with a Division
(or Divisions) associated with the user on the User Miscellaneous Information zone on the Miscellaneous tab of
the User portal. This applies to all service point queries, including use of the Service Point Search zone, the Route
**Management and 360 Search portals, and service point queries on other zones and portals.**

###### Unbadged Items

Items that do not have any unique identification are referred to as "unbadged." These types of items, unlike "badged"
items, do not have a device to represent them. Instead they are associated to service points with the service point category
of "multi-item." For these types of service points a list of "unbadged" items can be configured to represent the items that
require usage to be calculated. This is an effective dated list that allows for changes over time to the type and count of items
over time. The consumption of the list of items is either calculated using the service quantity associated to the item types
listed or by using the installation override quantity that can be specified on the service point.

Refer to Multi Time Zone Support for additional information on the importance of the Service Point time zone.

###### Maintaining Service Points

You use the Service Point portal to view and maintain service points.

Refer to About Service Points for additional functional information.

You can access the portal by selecting Menu, then Device Installation, then Service Point. You are brought to a query
portal with options for searching. Once your record has been selected you are brought to the maintenance portal to view and
maintain the selected record.

**NOTE:** When searching for services points or creating new service points, if the Restrict Division setting in the
**Control by Division section in the MDM Master Configuration is set to "Yes", only service point types with a Division**
(or Divisions) associated with the user on the User Miscellaneous Information zone on the Miscellaneous tab of
the User portal will be available. In addition, the Division drop-down list will only list divisions associated with the
user.

##### Service Point Quantities

###### About Service Point Quantities

Service point quantities are quantities that are stored at the service point level. These quantities are calculated at irregular
frequencies (such as annually or quarterly) and thus do not make sense as a measured quantity on a device and measuring
component. For example, in some deregulated markets the Peak Load Contribution could be stored here and effective dated
over time to represent the changing contribution of a given service point to the market wide coincidence peaks.

Service point quantities are defined by the following:

- **Service Point: The service point for which the quantities were calculated**

- **Service Point Quantity Type: The Service Point Quantity Type used for the record**

- **Start Date / End Date: The date range for the calculated quantity**

- **Service Point Quantities: Calculated quantities based on Quantity Identifiers configured on the Service Point Quantity**
Type (see Understanding Service Point Quantity Types for more information)

**NOTE:** There cannot be more than one Service Point Quantity for the same Service Point, Service Point Quantity Type,
for the same time period (defined by the Start Date and End Date parameters).

- **Service Point Quantity: This zone displays the basic attributes of the service point quantity**

##### Install Events

###### About Install Events

Whenever a device is installed at a Service Point, an installation event is created. Installation events capture the history of
the devices that have been installed at a Service Point. This allows consumption for a Service Point to be calculated over
time. In technical terms, installation events (or Install Events) link a specific Device Configuration to a Service Point.

There are specific Install Event business objects for different types of devices, including smart meters, items, manual
meters, and communication components.

When creating Install Events for items, only "badged" items (those that are uniquely identified in some way) use item Install
Events. "Unbadged" items do not use Install Events. Instead, the number of each type of item is specified in the "Multi-Item
Detail" section of the Service Point.

While a device is installed at a Service Point, it may be turned off (and back on again). The installation event that records
the original installation date and time also records the dates and times when the device has been turned on and off. When a
device is removed, the original installation event is updated with the removal date and time.

###### Maintaining Install Events

This portal is used to display and maintain an Install Event.

Refer to About Install Events for additional functional information.

##### Correcting Cross Installed Meters


D1-ManualMeterInstallEvent

D1-SmartMeterInstallEvent


Cross installed meters is the term for situations in which meters are deployed at an incorrect customer service point.
Consider the following example: Meter A is supposed to be installed at Service Point A and Meter B is supposed to be
installed at Service Point B, but Meter B was mistakenly installed at Service Point A, and Meter A was mistakenly installed
at Service Point B. This means that both customers will be billed incorrectly (customer at Service Point A will be billed for
usage at Service Point B and vice versa) until the system can updated to reflect the correct meter installations.

The Cross Installed Meters process provides a tool to re-configure the meters through a correction process. When a user
initiates the Cross Installed Meters process, the system will update device installation event details (like status, date and
time of installation), device configurations, and measuring components with the correct information. Note that this process
does NOT include changing the physical location of the meters. It only changes the relationship between the meters and
service points in the application.

This process can also be used to issue financial adjustments and/or cancel/rebill any bill segments that are impacted by the
change in meters, and create customer contacts related to the changes. See Adjustments and Cancel / Rebill Incorrect Bill
Segments for more information about adjustments and rebilling.

Cross installed meter processing is initiated, monitored, and maintained using the Process Flow portal and functionality.

See Process Flows in the Administrative User Guide for more information regarding the process flow functionality.

See Configuring Cross Installed Meter Processing in the Administrative User Guide for information about configuring
administrative data required by the Cross Installed Meter process.

###### Initiating a Cross Installed Meter Process

###### Initiating Cross Installed Meter Process Flows from Field Activities

There can be situations in which a field crew discovers that a meter is installed at an incorrect customer service point. For
instance a crew might be taking a manual meter reading or performing some other field activity when they realize that the
error. Field crews can initiate a Cross Installed Meter process flow by providing the correct meter information (the meter's
badge number) as part of the completion information sent back to the field activity (via an Inbound Communication).

To create a a Cross Installed Meter process flow in this way, the inbound communication must include a
"CROSSEDMETER" Field Activity Remark Type (from the Field Activity Remark Type extendable lookup) in the
Completion Details/Completion Information/Remark Types section, and the Badge Number of the meter physically
installed at the service point in the Response Details/Message Details/Utility Completion Information/Cross Installed Meter
section. When the inbound communication is received by the field activity and the field activity is completed, it creates a
completion event based on the Create Meter Process Completion Event (X1-CreateCrossedMeterProcess) business object
which instantiates a Cross Installed Meter process flow and an associated To Do entry. The Process Flow type and To Do
type to create are derived from the Cross Installed Meter action method (See Configuring Cross Installed Meter Processing
in the Administrative User Guide for information about configuring the Cross Installed Meter Action Method).

Inbound communications of this type can be created using the Field Activity Inbound Communication (D1FieldActivityIBComm) Inbound Web Service or manually using the Communication portal.

When the new Cross Installed Meter process flow is created, the Service Point ID and Meter ID defined in the field activity
are used to populate the "Meter 1" information. Note that the Investigate option is disabled for Meter 1 for process flows
created this way. The actual meter badge number in the physical world and the service point where it's installed in the
application are used to populate the "Meter 2" information.

information about inbound communications. See Understanding Inbound Web Services in the Administrative User Guide
for more information about using and invoking inbound web services.

##### Route Management

###### About Route Management

Route management involves managing the order of the Service Points within measurement cycles and routes.

When creating Service Points, each Service Point can reference a measurement cycle, route, and its sequence within the
route. Over time, as Service Points are added and removed to and from measurement cycles and routes, it may become
necessary to change the sequence of Service Points within the measurement cycles and routes used in your implementation.

- A measurement cycle defines WHEN the Service Point is visited

- A route within a cycle defines a group of Service Points in a cycle that are visited by a meter reader

- A sequence within a route defines the physical position of the Service Point within a route

- A schedule specifies the dates on which Service Points are visited.

Manually read Service Point reference a measurement cycle, route and sequence within the route. A batch process creates
SP/Measurement Cycle Schedule Routes for each Service Point, which link the dates on a measurement cycle schedule to
a measurement cycle route defined for the Service Point. These define the specific date on which a meter reader will visit
Service Points associated with a specific measurement cycle route, and the sequence in which the Service Points on that
route are visited.

###### Measurement Cycles

Measurement cycles define the schedule for manual meter reading of devices at Service Points in that cycle. Measurement
cycles can have one or more associated routes used to collect measurements.

Measurement cycles can also be configured to define when to create usage transactions for Usage Subscriptions associated
to Service Points in the cycle.

###### Measurement Cycle Schedules

Measurement cycle schedules define the dates on which devices are scheduled to be read for a given measurement cycle and
the routes used to collect measurements for the measurement cycle.

###### Working with Route Management

This Route Management portal is used to change the sequence of Service Points within a measurement cycle and route and
to transfer Service Points from one measurement cycle and route to another.

Refer to About Route Management for additional functional information.

You can access the portal from the Main > Device Installation > Route Management. You are brought to a query portal
with options for searching. Once you enter your search criteria, a list of related Service Points is presented.

The following actions are available once a Measurement Cycle and Route are selected:

- **Renumber Sequence: renumbers the sequence of selected Service Points for the route. Use the Renumber Sequence**
page to renumber the sequence of Service Points in a measurement cycle route.


-----

- **Transfer Measurement Cycle Route: Use this button to transfer the selected Service Points to another route. Use the**
Transfer Measurement Cycle Route page to transfer the selected Service Points to another measurement cycle route. You
can also renumber the sequence of Service Points in their new route as part of the transfer.

##### Facilities

###### About Facilities

Facilities represent the network node level closest to the Service Point. In terms of electric networks, facilities typically
represent transformers.

While "Facility" is the generic name for this object, many of the Business Objects created within Oracle Utilities Meter
Data Management have a more specific name. One good example is the Transformer (D1-Transformer) Business Object.

###### Maintaining Facilities

This portal is used to display and maintain a Facility.

Refer to About Facilities for additional functional information.

You can access the portal from Menu > Device Installation > Facility. You are brought to a query portal with options for
searching. Once your record has been selected you are brought to the maintenance portal to view and maintain the selected
record.

The following zones may appear as part of the portal's Main tab page:

- **Facility: defines the basic attributes of the facility**

- **Network Locations Related to Facility: displays a list of network locations associated with the current facility in**
reverse chronological order.

- **Service Points Related to Facility: displays a list of Service Points related to the current facility, in reverse**
chronological order.

##### Network Locations

###### About Network Locations

Network locations define the location of a facility within a larger network.

Network locations hold the network nodes that provide service to a facility. In the case of electric networks, network
locations define the feeder and substation associated with a transformer (facility). Because these network nodes can change
over time, a facility can have many network locations (this is an effective-dated relationship). For example, for electric
Service Points, whenever the substation or feeder that provides power to a given transformer is changed, a new record that
references the latest substation and feeder should be created.

#### Measurements

##### Initial Measurement Data

###### About Initial Measurement Data

Initial measurement data (IMD) is the term for measurement data in its initial (or raw) form.

Measurements read from a measuring component are referred to as "initial measurement data" (or initial measurements) and
are used to record how much of the quantity (defined by UOM, TOU, and SQI) measured by the measuring component was
consumed.

Initial measurement data for scalar measuring components contain a single "reading" or value, while initial measurement
data for interval measuring components can contain multiple readings, one for each interval that falls between the start time
and stop time of the measurement.

At a simple level, initial measurement data goes through the following process:

**1. Initial measurements are loaded into the system.**

**2. Initial measurement data is validated, edited, and estimated (VEE). Please refer to About VEE for more details on the**
VEE process.

**3. Initial measurements are converted into final measurements.**

**4. If using Oracle Utilities Meter Data Management, final measurements are used to calculate usage (bill determinants,**
etc.). Please refer to About Usage Calculation for more details on the usage calculation process.

Only initial measurements can be edited directly by end users.

Initial measurement data contains both the original and final versions of the quantities recorded by the measuring
component.

- Pre VEE quantities are consumption values derived from the measurements recorded by the head end system or meter
reader with the appropriate installation and measuring component multipliers applied.

- Post VEE quantities are the "final" values, after VEE processing.

Pre VEE and Post VEE quantities in an initial measurement often differ based on a number of conditions, including:

- VEE rules have changed the quantities because they are missing or obviously wrong. In this, the Pre VEE values are
adjusted based on the specifics of the VEE rules applied to the initial measurement to create the Post VEE values

- Manual changes by a user.

In addition to recorded consumption values, measurements also have condition codes, used to indicate the source and
quality of a measurement. For example:


-----

- Regularly recorded measurements might have a condition code of "Regular"

- Missing measurements might have a condition code of "Missing"

- Estimated measurements might have a condition code of "External Estimated" or "System Estimated" based on where the
estimation was performed.

Both Pre VEE and Post VEE values have their own condition code, which can also change during VEE processing. For
example, a measurement that was missing in the Pre VEE document will likely become "System Estimated" in the Post
VEE document once VEE has been executed.

###### Processing Initial Measurement Data

Initial measurement data (IMD) received from external systems is processed through two major stages:

- **IMD Seeder: This is the common interface point that receives all IMD information and performs critical validations**
and conversions. During this process the IMD Seeder identifies the appropriate specific IMD business object for further
processing. The choice is made based on the category of IMD being processed (typically initial load) and the type of
measuring component the IMD is for. For example, an IMD for an interval measuring component would result in the
Initial Load IMD (Interval) business object being selected. If for some reason the IMD Seeder encounters an error an
instance of the IMD Seeder will be created to manage the resolution of that error.

- **Specific IMD: Each specific IMD has the appropriate calculation and validation logic for the type of data that has been**
received. An IMD containing scalar data will be processed differently than interval data or subtractive interval data.
However, all types of data will have a similar set of steps taken:

  - Any external system specific statuses for the measurement data are interpreted into the appropriate internal statuses

  - An initial consumption calculation is performed

  - VEE rules are executed

  - Final measurements are created

###### IMD Seeder Processing

The IMD Seeder receives IMD data in a common structure, however, the content of the data (identifiers, date/times, etc)
can vary depending on the system and the particular device that generated it. To accurately translate the external content
to values understood by the system the IMD Seeder leverages the configuration of the service provider (aka head end or
external system) and the device.

The service provider specifies the following inputs into IMD Seeder processing:

- **Identifier Types: Each IMD must identify the device and measuring component the data has been generated from.**
The system supports a multitude of identifiers for both the device and measuring component. The service provider
configuration specifies which identifier types are used for both the device and the measuring component which enables
the IMD seeder to search for the correct destination for the measurement data. For example, a service provider might
indicate that devices are identified by a serial number and measuring components are identified by a channel identifier.

- **Date/Time Format: The service provider configuration will identify whether the date/times that were sent included**
specific time zone designations. This allows the system to accurately handle any time zone conversions that may be
necessary.

- **Processing Methods: A service provider has many processing methods that are used in the evaluation of the IMD.**

  - Initial Measurement Creation - Maps a given measuring component type to the initial measurement BO that should be
created

  - UOM Translation - Identifies the extendable lookup that should be used to map the service provider specific UOM to
the internal UOM

  - TOU Translation - Identifies the extendable lookup that should be used to map the service provider specific TOU to
the internal TOU


-----

  - SQI Translation - Identifies the extendable lookup that should be used to map the service provider specific SQI to the
internal SQI

  - Time Zone Translation - Identifies the extendable lookup to be used in mapping the service provider specific time
zone to the interval time zone.

The device specifies the following inputs into IMD Seeder processing:

- **Incoming Data Shift: This value is either specified directly on the device or can be defaulted via fallback on the device**
type. It identifies whether the incoming date/time information has is "Shifted" meaning it has been adjusted for Daylight
Savings Time (DST) when in effect, or it is "Not Shifted" which means it will never be adjusted for DST. This plays an
important role in the date/time processing since all incoming IMD date/times will be stored without an adjustment for
DST.

With these inputs the IMD Seeder is able to translate the external identifiers into the appropriate identifiers to tie the IMD
data to a specific measuring component in the system.

Once a measuring component is identified it is then used to select the appropriate IMD business object using the "Initial
Measurement Creation" processing method of the service provider.

###### IMD Seeder Critical Validations

For Initial Measurement Data (IMD) to continue on to specific IMD processing it must pass several critical validations:

- The measuring component must be identified.

- The IMD must contain the appropriate date/times for the type of IMD being processed: scalar must have an end date/time
and interval must have both a start and end date/time.

- The interval list must match the number of intervals expected based on the IMD start and end date/times. Note: if there
are too few intervals the missing intervals can be automatically added to the IMD without generating an error. How this
is done depends on whether there are date/times for each individual interval. If there are date/times for each interval the
missing intervals are placed where the gaps exist. Otherwise when there are no date/times for the individual intervals the
missing intervals are added to the end of the interval list.

If any of the critical validations have failed the IMD processing will be halted and an instance of the IMD Seeder will be
created

Note: There is special logic that exists for handling the situation where either the IMD start date/time or the IMD end
date/time falls on the duplicate hour that occurs when a time zone transitions out of daylight savings time. Typically there
are two 1AMs on that day, one is considered to be during DST and the other is not. To ensure that the appropriate hour
is selected the IMD Seeder uses the count of intervals and final measurements that exist prior to the IMD to identify the
appropriate hour.

**NOTE:** Additional detail on the logic to derive the service provider, device, and measuring component identification can
be found on the D1-DER-SPRMC Algorithm Type.

###### IMD Seeder Time Zone Translation and Conversion

To provide the most accurate tracking of measurement data all initial measurement data is stored in a single time zone
without an adjustment for Daylight Savings Time (DST). As utilities can have multiple head end systems that each
send date/time information in different ways and some utilities operate in multiple time zones the IMD Seeder contains
functionality to convert incoming date/times from a source time zone into the time zone of Oracle Utilities Meter Data
Management (as indicated by the base time zone)

There are three components to identifying the source time zone of the incoming IMD:

- **Service Provider IMD Import Date/Time Format: When the IMD date/times are sent in format that identifies the time**
zone for each date/time the date/times will be delivered to the IMD Seeder already converted.

- **Incoming Data Shift: This indicates whether the date/times will be adjusted for DST while it is in effect. A value of**
"Always in Local Time" indicates that the date/times are adjusted for DST. A value of "Always in Standard Time"
indicates that the date/times are not adjusted for DST

- **Time Zone: The time zone of the incoming data is identified using the follow order of precedence:**

**1. The time zone as indicated by the IMD data**

**2. The service point time zone**

**3. The device configuration time zone**

**4. The measuring component time zone**

**5. The base time zone**

Once the time zone and the data shift of the incoming date/times is identified all date/times will be converted from that time
zone and shift into the base time zone in standard time.

**NOTE:** Additional detail on the logic for date/time adjustments and validation of undercount and overcount can be
found on the D1-DODTTMADJ Algorithm Type.

###### Specific Initial Measurement Data Processing

There are several categories of initial measurement data:

**_Initial Load_**

When initial measurement data is received from external systems (e.g. Head End systems) it is processed using the initial
load IMD type. These IMDs are configured to execute the VEE rules that as associated to the Initial Load VEE role on the
measuring component (or measuring component type in the case of a fallback). For adapter specific variations of the Initial
Load IMD there is logic to map external measurement statuses to measurement conditions.

**_Estimation_**

For various reasons a meter will not report measurement data for a certain period of time. When the system detects that a
measuring component is missing final measurements, it can create an initial measurement to execute estimation rules. This
type of initial measurement is referred to as an estimated initial measurement.

At a high-level, the estimation process is as follows:

- Missing final measurements are detected by the Periodic Estimation process

- Estimated initial measurements are created for the "missing" time period by the Period Estimation process

- Values and consumption for the estimated initial measurements are calculated by "estimation" VEE rules.

It's important to note that the processes that detect missing measurements do NOT themselves estimate consumption.
Rather, these detection processes simply create an initial measurement and let the estimation VEE rules estimate the
consumption for the initial measurement.

Estimation IMDs execute the VEE rules associated to the Estimation VEE role on the measuring component (or measuring
component type in the case of a fallback).

**NOTE:** Refer to Periodic Estimation for additional functional information about how the periodic estimation can fill in
missing reads for both interval and scalar measuring components.

**_Manual Override_**

Manual override IMDs are used when the creation of an IMD is user initiated as can be done from the various functions
available on some of the 360 Degree zones (e.g., Final Values Overlay, Interval - Initial Measurement Overlay, etc.). Unlike
other types of IMD manual override allow the user to edit the initial measurement data prior to performing VEE. These
IMDs are used for more advanced tasks where a user must specify, either directly or through a measurement function, the
values for the initial measurements.


-----

These IMDs are systematically created during the reconciliation process that occurs when IMDs are finalized for measuring
components with subtractive consumption calculations. They are used to recalculate the consumption on a measurement
subsequent to an IMD when the start reading for that subsequent measurement has been changed.

Manual override IMDs execute the VEE rules associated to the Manual Override VEE role on the measuring component (or
measuring component type in the case of a fallback).

**_System_**

A system is generated by internal system processes that need to recalculate measurement multipliers. They do not perform
VEE but they can be configured to do so.

**NOTE:** Refer to About Measurement Reprocessing for additional functional information about how the system IMDs
are created.

**_Data Conversion_**

This type of IMD has only the processing necessary to propagate converted measurement data into the system. The data
provided to these IMDs is expected to be the quality of final measurements. Therefore no VEE rules will be executed.

###### Scalar Initial Measurement Data Processing

Initial measurement data for subtractive scalar measuring components contain start and stop readings in addition to Pre and
Post VEE usage. For example, a set of initial measurements for a subtractive scalar measuring component might look like
the following:


**Date/Time** **Start Reading** **Stop Reading** **Pre VEE Usage** **Pre VEE**

**Condition**


**Post VEE Usage** **Post VEE**

**Condition**


01/01/2010

12:00AM

02/02/2010

01:00PM


0 1500 1500 Regular 1500 Regular

1500 2100 0 Missing 600 System Estimate

2100 2900 800 Regular 800 Regular

2900 3500 0 Missing 600 System Estimate


Subtractive measuring components can "rollover" when the reading exceeds the maximum value based on the number of
dials on the measuring component . For example, a register with a 4 dials can record values up to 9999 before rolling over to
0000. When this occurs, consumption is calculated based on the following attributes and calculated values.

- **Rollover Threshold is the percentage of the measuring component's dial capacity at which measurements for measuring**
components of this type are considered to have rolled over. Dial capacity is the largest value that can be recorded for the
measuring component, based on the measuring component's number of dials. For example, a measuring component with
5 dials has a dial capacity of 99999.

- **Number of Dials is the number of dials used to record values on the register, and is equal to the Number of Digits Left**
field configured on the measuring component.

- **Max Dial Capacity is the maximum value for the number of dials, rounded up to the next whole multiple of 10 (or 10**
raised to the power of the number of dials). For example, for a register with 4 dials, the max dial value is 10000.

- **Max Acceptable Difference is the maximum acceptable consumption that can be recorded for the register. This is equal**
to the Max Dial Capacity multiplied by the rollover threshold. For example, the Max Acceptable Difference for a register
with 4 dials and a rollover threshold of 90% would be 9000. If the consumption is greater than this value, the initial
measurement is transitioned to the Error state.


-----

- **Difference: The difference between the Stop Reading and Start Reading, obtained by subtracting the Start Reading from**
the Stop Reading. If the Difference is less than zero (<0), then add the Max Dial Capacity to calculate Rollover.

- **Rollover: The adjusted consumption for a reading on a register that has rolled over. Only applicable if the Difference**
(Stop Reading - Start Reading) is less than zero (<0).

- **Consumption: The calculated consumption for the reading, equal to either the Difference or Rollover. If the Difference**
is greater than or equal to zero, consumption is equal to the Difference. If the Difference is less than zero (<0), and the
Rollover is less than or equal to the Max Acceptable Difference, the consumption is equal to the Rollover.

**Example: Consider an initial measurement with the following attributes:**

- Number of Dials: 4

- Rollover Threshold: 90 (%)

- Start Reading: 8900

- Stop Reading: 0500

For this reading,

- Max Dial Capacity = 10000

- Max Acceptable Difference = 9000 (10000 * 90)

- Difference = 0500 (Stop Reading) - 8900 (Start Reading) or -8400

- Rollover = 10000 (Max Dial Capacity) + -8400 (Difference) or 1600

- Consumption is equal to 1600 (Rollover).

Each scalar IMD that is processed will perform a rollover validation based on the start reading. For those scalar IMDs that
have measurements subsequent to the date being processed there will be an additional rollover validation forwards to ensure
that the current IMD does not invalidate a future reading.

If the rollover validation fails when validating either backwards, forwards, or both then the system will attempt to
automatically correct the situation by evaluating whether the measurements prior to or subsequent to the IMD can be
removed. This analysis is done based on the condition of the measurement and the condition of the IMD. For example. If
there is a rollover based on the start measurement and the start measurement is a system estimate but the IMD is regular
then the start reading will be bypassed and the system will search backwards until:

- It identifies a measurement with a reading that does not cause a rollover when used as the start reading for the IMD

- It encounters a measurement that causes a rollover but is also regular and therefore cannot be bypassed. At this point the
IMD would be placed in an error status.

When a rollover error is identified that cannot be automatically corrected there are a few options available for fixing the
situation:

- The "Override Condition" functionality can be used. This is an action button available on the IMD from within the Error
status. It allows the user to provide a higher quality condition for the IMD to force the rollover process to bypass the
measurement (either prior to or subsequent to the IMD) that was the source of the rollover threshold error. For example,
if the start read was a regular measurement and the IMD was also a regular measurement the user could update the IMD
to have a condition of "Super" which would allow the regular start reading to be bypassed.

- A Manual Override IMD could be created to adjust the measurements surrounding the IMD to ensure that the rollover
error is no longer encountered.

**NOTE:** When a measurement is bypassed by the rollover automatic correction logic it will be set to Do Not Use when
the IMD is finalized.

A scalar IMD can generate a manual override IMD during the finalization process when the need for reconciliation is
identified. This happens whenever an IMD is received that occurs prior to an already existing scalar measurement. Since
the newly processed IMD will introduce a new start reading for the existing subsequent measurement it is necessary to use


-----

the manual override IMD to recalculate the consumption. For example, imagine a scalar measuring component had the
following readings:


**Date/Time** **Start Reading** **Stop Reading** **Pre VEE Usage** **Pre VEE**

**Condition**


**Post VEE Usage** **Post VEE**

**Condition**


01/01/2010

0 1500 1500 Regular 1500 Regular

1500 2100 0 Regular 600 Regular

2100 3500 1400 Regular 1400 Regular


When the February reading is finally received it will spawn a reconciliation Manual Override IMD to correct the
consumption of the April reading given the new start reading:


**Date/Time** **Start Reading** **Stop Reading** **Pre VEE Usage** **Pre VEE**

**Condition**


**Post VEE Usage** **Post VEE**

**Condition**

2100 2900 800 Regular 800 Regular

2900 3500 600 Regular 600 Regular


**NOTE:** These reconciliation IMDs are generated during the finalization of the initiating IMD and must finalize
themselves. If for some reason the reconciliation IMD does not complete it will prevent the initiating IMD from
finalizing as well. Typically the reason for this issue will be a VEE exception that is being raised against the
reconciliation IMD. The reason this rule is enforced is to ensure that the quantity of a measurement always aligns to the
reading of that same measurement. If this situation arises the data source of the IMD can be used as an input to the VEE
rule eligibility to skip certain rules when the IMD is a reconciliation IMD since the reconciliation process add a data
source of "Generated by Reconciliation" to each reconciliation IMD.

###### Interval Initial Measurement Data Processing

Given the consumption calculation for interval channels is done using the consumptive method the Interval IMD variants do
not contain much special processing outside of the general pattern described in Processing Initial Measurement Data.

###### Subtractive Interval Initial Measurement Data Processing

Initial measurement data for subtractive interval measuring components readings and usage for each interval in addition
to Pre and Post VEE usage. Furthermore, there is a condition for both the reading and the usage which allows for more
accurate recalculation of intervals. The start reading for each interval is considered to be the reading from the prior interval.
For the first interval the start reading will be identified from the measurement data for the measurement immediately
prior to the IMD. For example, an initial measurement for a subtractive interval measuring component might look like the
following when we assume a start reading of 1490:


**Date/Time** **Pre VEE Reading /**

**Condition**


**Pre VEE Usage /**

**Condition**


**Post VEE Reading /**

**Condition**


**Post VEE Usage /**

**Condition**


01/01/2010 01:00AM 1500 / Regular 10 / Regular 1500 / Regular 10 / Regular


-----

01/01/2010 2:00AM 0 / Missing 0 / Missing 1520 / System Estimate 20 / System Estimate

01/01/2010 3:00AM 1525 / Regular 5 / System Estimate 1525 / Regular 5 / System Estimate

01/01/2010 4:00AM 1540 / Regular 15 / Regular 1540 / Regular 15 / Regular

Subtractive interval IMDs can validate for rollovers based on the configuration of the measuring component. See Scalar
Initial Measurement Data Processing for more details on how rollovers are calculated.

How subtractive interval IMDs identify rollover errors is identical to scalar IMDs. However, the resolution of those
errors is much different. With scalar any bypassed measurements are handled at the point of finalizing the IMD and the
measurements are set to Do Not Use. With subtractive interval any bypassed measurements are added to the IMDs interval
list so that they are processed along with the IMD that identified them as causing a rollover.

Subtractive interval IMDs also must initiate the reconciliation of an interval that comes directly after the IMD being
processed. Unlike scalar this is not handled through a separate IMD. Rather the next measurement after the IMD being
processed is added to the current IMD and the reconciliation of the usage for that measurement is computed as part of the
IMD. This allows for any validation errors that are encountered in the recalculation of that measurement to be resolved
along with the IMD.

**NOTE:** There is one scenario that does result in a reconciliation IMD being generated. When the last interval of an
IMD has the reading changed during the VEE process it will require that a reconciliation IMD be generated to adjust the
usage of the next measurement after the IMD (if applicable).

The subtractive interval IMDs are responsible for ensuring that the reading for each interval is in line with the usage
calculated. This maintenance is performed each time the IMD is run through the VEE rules. After which the IMD will
examine each interval and identify which intervals require an update to the reading or quantity.

###### Initial Measurement Data Valid Date Boundaries

Meter Data Management can be configured to define an acceptable date range for initial measurement processing, providing
a mechanism to restrict either future measurements or very old measurements from being processed by Meter Data
Management.

Defining this date range is done via the following parameters in the Device Measurement Parameters section of the MDM
Master Configuration:

- **Prevent Future Measurement Records: Indicates if the system should prevent processing for measurements deemed**
to be "future" measurements, based on the Number of Days Before Considered Future parameter. If a measurement is
deemed to be a "future" measurement and this is set to "Yes", the initial measurement is moved to the "Error" state.

- **Number of Days Before Considered Future: The number of days in the future (based on the IMD From Date Time)**
before a measurement is considered to be a "future" measurement. If the IMD From Date Time for a measurement is
more days in the future than this setting, the measurement is considered "future".

- **Prevent Old Measurement Records: Indicates if the system should prevent processing for measurements deemed to be**
"old" measurements, based on the Number of Days Before Considered Old parameter. If a measurement is deemed to
be an "old" measurement and this is set to "Yes", the initial measurement is moved to the "Error" state.

- **Number of Days Before Considered Old: The number of days in the past (based on the IMD From Date Time) before a**
measurement is considered to be an "old" measurement. If the IMD From Date Time for a measurement is more days in
the past than this setting, the measurement is considered "old".

###### Deferring Initial Measurement Data Processing

Meter Data Management can be configured to defer processing for initial measurements that are in the past, but that
are not yet deemed to be "old" (based on the Number of Days Before Considered Old parameter on the MDM Master
Configuration). This ensure that a meter that "wakes" up and sends a large payload of data, including old measurements,
will not adversely impact initial measurement processing during critical processing windows.


-----

Configuring the system for deferring initial measurement processing is done via the following parameters in the Device
**Measurement Parameters section of the MDM Master Configuration:**

- **Defer Old Measurement Records: Indicates if the system should defer processing of measurements whose IMD**
**From Date Time falls between the Number of Days Before Deferring and the Number of Days Before Considered**
**Old parameters. Note that when this parameter is set to "Yes", the Number of Days Before Deferred must be supplied.**

- **Number of Days Before Deferred: The number of days in the past (based on the IMD From Date Time) before a**
measurement should be deferred. Initial measurements with dates older than this setting but not as old as the Number of
**Days Before Considered Old will be deferred (the measurement is moved to the Defer state). If provided, this must be a**
positive number and must be less than Number of Days Before Considered Old setting.

Deferring initial measurement data processing requires that the Compare IMD Date/Times to Master Config Boundaries
algorithm (D2-CMIMDDTMC) be defined as an Enter algorithm on the VEE Ready state for all initial measurement
business objects for which deferring processing is to be enabled. See the Detailed Description of this algorithm for more
information.

###### Initial Measurement Data Prioritization

By default, initial measurements are created and/or received into the system in an initial state of "Pending" and are
transitioned to subsequent states via the "IMD Monitor - Physical Devices" Monitor process. This Monitor process can
be skipped by setting the Execution Method flag on the initial measurement to "Real Time" (D1RT), in which case an
Enter algorithm transitions the initial measurement to the next state in its lifecycle immediately. This feature can be used to
prioritize processing of certain types of initial measurements.

The Execution Method flag can be set in initial measurements sent from the head end system, or can be inserted during
Oracle Utilities Smart Grid Gateway Adapter processing.

Oracle Utilities Smart Grid Gateway Adapters set this flag to "Real Time" on all measurements created as the result of
smart meter commands (Remote Connect, Remote Disconnect, or On-Demand Read) or completion events (including Field
Activity Completion Events used with Service Order Management).

###### Maintaining Measuring Component Dates

There are several date/times systematically maintained on measuring components that aid in the efficient processing of
initial measurement data as well as informing the periodic estimation process.

During initial measurement data finalization these dates are maintained by a series of algorithms based on the type of
measuring component and type of initial measurement.

###### Important Measuring Component Dates

Each initial measurement is evaluated to determine if the following dates should be updated on the measuring component.

**Last Contiguous Read Date/Time**
This represents the last point where an uninterrupted series of measurements were received for the measuring component.
Periodic estimation uses this field to generate estimates for any periods of missing measurements for the measuring
component.

For interval measuring components this date will be updated whenever the current value falls between the initial
measurement's From and To Date/Time fields (inclusive) in one of two ways:

**1. If there are no measurements subsequent to the initial measurement being processed it will be set to the initial**
measurement To Date/Time

**2. If there are measurements subsequent to the initial measurement and the initial measurement has filled a gap of missing**
measurements then it will be set to the Last Contiguous Measurement Date/Time that is subsequent to the initial
measurement To Date/Time


-----

For scalar measuring components there is an added check to ensure that the initial measurement’s To Date/Time is exactly
one expected measurement after the current last contiguous read date/time

**Adjusted Latest Measurement Date/Time**
For scalar meters this date is derived by assigning the last contiguous read date/time to an expected measurement date/
time based on the measuring component type configuration for Expected Hours Between Measurements, First Daily
Measurement Time, Early Threshold and Late Threshold.

For example, if a measurement is expected every 6 hours and the adjusted last contiguous read date/time on the measuring
component is January 1[st] at 12:00:00AM, then the initial measurement's To Date/Time must align to the expected
measurement date/time of January 1[st] at 06:00:00AM so the latest measurement date/time can be updated.

The expected measurement date/times are calculated using the expected hours between measurements and the first daily
measurement time elements from the measuring component type. For example, if the expected hours between measurements
was 6 hours and the first daily measurement date/time was 12:00:00AM, then the expected measurement date/times for each
day would be:

- 12:00:00AM

- 06:00:00AM

- 12:00:00PM

- 06:00:00PM

To account for scalar reads that are not received for an exact date/time, the Early Threshold and Late Threshold elements of
the measuring component type are used to align a given measurement to one of the expected measurement date/times.

**Most Recent Read Date/Time**
This represents the maximum measurement date/time that exists for the measuring component. This field is leveraged
throughout the system to identify when certain logic must be executed. For example, if there are no measurements in the
future to what is being processed then no logic dealing with future measurements need be executed.

It will be updated to the initial measurement's To Date/Time whenever the initial measurement's To Date/Time is greater
than the current most recent read date/time.

**Most Recent Non Estimated Read Date/Time**
Represents the latest measurement processed that was not estimated. This is leveraged by the outage storm mode module.

It will be updated to the latest non-estimated measurement date/time in the initial measurement that is more recent than the
current most recent non-estimated read date/time.

###### Identifying Data for Historical Extracts

Another important role for each of the algorithms that maintains measuring component dates is to identify whether the data
being processed needs to be re-extracted for one of the existing measurement extract methods:

**1. Specialized Measurement Extract**

**2. Specialized IMD Header Extract**

**3. DataConnect**

**4. Configurable Consumption Extract**

If the data should be re-extracted a record will be created in the general processing table to be extracted at a later point.

It is important to note that by default these checks are turned off for performance reasons. If you would like to capture
historical changes for any of these extracts it will need to be turned on for each individual algorithm.


-----

###### Date Maintenance Algorithms

The following algorithms are used to maintain measuring component dates.

**D1-UPD-DTMC - Update Latest Measurement Date/Time on MC with Consumption Sync**
This algorithm applies to initial load and manual initial measurements for interval measuring components.

This algorithm maintains important summary level dates on the Measuring Component (MC) as well as initiating the
Consumption Synchronization process.

The following dates are maintained:

- Last Contiguous Read Date/Time

- Most Recent Read Date/Time

- Most Recent Non Estimated Read Date/Time

**NOTE:** If the first time Periodic Estimation will be executed after initial conversion the Latest Read Date/Time has not
been initialized for any measuring components the "No of Hours in Past to Retrieve Last Useable Measurement" option
of the Feature Configuration Type "Measurement Data Option" should be configured. This enables logic that will defer
the initialization of the Last Read Date/time to the Periodic Estimation process for any measuring component where it is
not currently populated but does have existing final measurements. Please refer to About Periodic Estimation for more
information.

If the initial measurement's device configuration is configured for related measuring component consumption
synchronization this algorithm can optionally identify whether there are any consumption synchronization eligible
measurements on the related measuring component (eligible measurements are defined as those whose condition falls
between the bottom and top ranges for consumption sync or the additional condition code for consumption sync). When
the initiating initial measurement is not "back dated" or the synchronization period does not extend past the initial
measurement's date range the appropriate interval or scalar consumption sync activity will be selected based on the
measuring component type of the related measuring component. When the initiating initial measurement is "back dated"
and there is a contiguous period of synchronization eligible measurements that extends past the date range of the initial
measurement the Gap Consumption Sync Activity will be created.

Lastly this algorithm can be configured to maintain outage related activities for the device. Since the receipt of initial
load data for a device indicates it is now powered on and communicating if there are any outstanding outage or
estimation suppression activities (initiated via widespread outage) they can be ended as of the from date/time of the initial
measurement.

**D1-UPD-DTMCF - Update Latest Date/Time on MC from a Future Measurement**
This algorithm applies to estimation initial measurements for interval measuring components.

This algorithm maintains important summary level dates on the Measuring Component (MC) as well as initiating the
Consumption Synchronization process.

The following dates are maintained:

- Last Contiguous Read Date/Time

- Most Recent Read Date/Time

- Most Recent Non Estimated Read Date/Time

As this algorithm is used on estimation initial measurement data it is not common that it will update the most recent nonestimated read date/time. However, there are circumstances where high quality estimations based on a check channel
might be given a measurement quality in the regular range. In our documentation we sometimes refer to these as prorated
measurements.

It is also important to note that this algorithm will not initiate consumption sync processing.


-----

**D1-UDTSCMCRE - Update Latest Measurement Date/Time on Scalar MC with Consumption Sync**
This algorithm applies to initial load and manual initial measurements for scalar measuring components.

This algorithm maintains important summary level dates on the Measuring Component (MC) as well as initiating the
Consumption Synchronization process.

The following dates are maintained:

- Last Contiguous Read Date/Time

- Adjusted Last Contiguous Read Date/Time

- Most Recent Read Date/Time

- Most Recent Non Estimated Read Date/Time

**NOTE:** If the last contiguous read date/time is not currently set for the measuring component then the initial
measurement is assumed to be the first initial measurement received for the measuring component the Last Contiguous
Read Date/Time will be set to the initial measurement To Date/Time. Furthermore, even if the Last Contiguous Read
Date/Rime does not align to one of the expected measurement date/times, the Last Contiguous Read Date/Time and
Adjusted Latest Contiguous Read Date/Time will be updated.

**NOTE:** If Auto-Read Scalar Periodic Estimation is being implemented for Auto-Read Scalar Devices that have existing
measurement history, then the "No of Hours in Past to Retrieve Last Useable Measurement" option of the "Measurement
Data Option" Feature Configuration Type should be configured. Logic will not initialize the latest measurement date/
time information for any measuring component that does not have any latest measurement date/time information but
does have existing final measurements. In these cases, the setting of the latest measurement date/time is deferred to the
Auto-Read Scalar Periodic Estimation process. Please refer to About Periodic Estimation for more information.

If the initial measurement's device configuration is configured for related measuring component consumption
synchronization this algorithm can optionally identify whether there are any consumption synchronization eligible
measurements on the related measuring component (eligible measurements are defined as those whose condition falls
between the bottom and top ranges for consumption synchronization or the additional condition code for consumption
synchronization). When the initiating initial measurement is not "back dated" or the synchronization period does not
extend past the initial measurement's date range the appropriate interval or scalar consumption synchronization activity
will be selected based on the measuring component type of the related measuring component. When the initiating initial
measurement is "back dated" and there is a contiguous period of synchronization eligible measurements that extends past
the date range of the initial measurement the Gap Consumption Sync Activity will be created.

Lastly this algorithm can be configured to maintain outage related activities for the device. Since the receipt of initial
load data for a device indicates it is now powered on and communicating if there are any outstanding outage or
estimation suppression activities (initiated via widespread outage) they can be ended as of the from date/time of the initial
measurement.

**D1-UPDDTSCMC - Update Latest Date/Time on Scalar Measuring Component**
This algorithm applies to estimation initial measurements for scalar measuring components.

This algorithm maintains important summary level dates on the Measuring Component (MC) as well as initiating the
Consumption Synchronization process.

The following dates are maintained:

- Last Contiguous Read Date/Time

- Adjusted Last Contiguous Read Date/Time

- Most Recent Read Date/Time

- Most Recent Non Estimated Read Date/Time


-----

**NOTE:** If the last contiguous read date/time is not currently set for the measuring component then the initial
measurement is assumed to be the first initial measurement received for the measuring component the Last Contiguous
Read Date/Time will be set to the initial measurement's To Date/Time. Furthermore, even if the Last Contiguous Read
Date/Time does not align to one of the expected measurement date/times, the Last Contiguous Read Date/Time and
adjusted Latest Contiguous Read Date/Time will be updated.

**NOTE:** If Auto-Read Scalar Periodic Estimation is being implemented for Auto-Read Scalar Devices that have existing
measurement history, then the "No of Hours in Past to Retrieve Last Useable Measurement" option of the "Measurement
Data Option" Feature Configuration Type should be configured. Logic will not initialize the latest measurement date/
time information for any measuring component that does not have any latest measurement date/time information but
does have existing final measurements. In these cases, the setting of the latest measurement date/time is deferred to the
Auto-Read Scalar Periodic Estimation process. Please refer to About Periodic Estimation for more information.

As this algorithm is used on estimation initial measurement data it is not common that it will update the Most Recent Non
Estimated Read Date/Time. However, there are circumstances where high quality estimations based on a check channel
might be given a measurement quality in the regular range. We sometimes refer to these as prorated measurements.

It is also important to note that this algorithm will not initiate consumption synchronization processing.

###### CSV Upload

Measurement data for a measuring component can be uploaded via comma separated values (CSV) files. See Uploading
Measurement Data for more information.

###### Importing Data From External Systems

In addition to importing data from head end systems for meters and other devices, the system can also import data from
other types of external systems such as weather systems or from market participants such as an independent system
operator (ISO) as part of a settlement market. Data received from these types of systems is stored in standalone measuring
components (see About Measuring Components for more information).

When importing data for standalone measuring components, initial measurement processing uses the Standalone Identifier
(or Standalone ID) to identify the measuring component for which the measurement data belongs.

Each external system from which data is imported should be defined as an external application. If the data being imported
uses units of measure or time of use periods that are specific to the external system, translation methods should be defined
to map the specific data to standard codes.

##### Final Measurements

###### About Final Measurements

Final measurements are measurements that have been validated, and if necessary, edited & estimated, and is ready for use in
downstream processing such as bill determinants calculations.

When an initial measurement is considered "final," that is, it has passed all VEE processing and no additional modifications
or changes need to be made, it is transformed into a Final Measurement, or simply a Measurement (the terms measurement,
final measurement, and final consumption all reference this same "final" measurement data). Only one final measurement
can exist for a given date/time for a given measuring component; one final measurement exists per interval, and likewise


-----

one final measurement exists for each scalar reading. In both cases, the final measurement value stored represents the
amount consumed between its date/time and the prior final measurement's date/time.

When creating final measurements from initial measurement data:

- Final measurements are created using Post VEE quantities

- Each final measurement's condition is copied from the Post VEE condition

- Initial measurements are normalized into final measurements where each final measurement is for a specific date and
time.

- Because a single initial measurement may contain many "readings," a separate final measurement is created for each
interval in the initial measurement. For example, if an initial measurement contains 24 hours of 15 minute readings, 96
measurements will be created, each with a specific date and time.

- A Combined Multiplier (created from multipliers defined for the measurement’s measuring component type and
install event) is stored for each measurement. In addition, other values are stored for measurements of specific types.
The Reading Value (which often differs from the measurement value) is stored for scalar and subtractive interval
measurements, and the Reading Condition is stored for subtractive interval measurements. These values are used with
measurement reprocessing and other recalculation processes in the event that the original initial measurements have been
archived or deleted.

The measurement date/time of a measurement represents the end of the period the measurement value covers. How the start
of the period is defined varies slightly based on the type of measuring component associated to the measurement:

- **Scalar Measuring Components: the measurement date/time represents the point at which the reading was taken. The**
period the measurement covers is defined as the previous measurements date/time through the measurement date/time.

- **Interval Measuring Components: the measurement date/time represents the end of the interval period. No date/time**
is stored to represent the beginning of the interval period, rather it is implied by the interval size of the measuring
component. For example an interval measuring component with an hourly interval size and a measurement date/time
of 01/01/2010 12:00AM represents the measured quantity for the period of 12/31/2009 11:00PM through 01/01/2010
12:00AM.

- For scalar measuring components there exist special circumstances where a final measurement is not eligible for use
in processing (e.g. consumption calculation, usage calculation, etc.). To prevent other processes from using these
measurements they are marked with a usage flag of "Do Not Use." This is typically the result of the automatic correction
of a rollover threshold error when lower quality measurements inaccurate measurements are removed to enable
successful calculation of subtractive consumption.

###### Conditions

Conditions are used to describe the quality of a final measurement and is an important input into many of our processes.
During initial measurement data processing these conditions help VEE rules identify the initial measurements that require
more advanced validation or estimation. During usage calculations measurement conditions help to inform the billing
system whether the billing determinants produced are based on actual data read from a meter or if it has been estimated (or
in many cases a combination of the two).

Conditions follow a numeric sequencing that begins at 000000 and goes up to 999999. As the condition code rises
numerically so does its perceived quality. Many areas the system take this into account:

- VEE rules use conditions to identify which initial measurement values need to be estimated or adjusted

- Rollover error automatic corrections allow higher quality data to bypass lower quality data in order to achieve a
consumption calculation that does not produce an error.

- Usage calculation rules can provide information about the quality of billing determinants based on the underlying
measurement data that feeds into those service quantities.

Throughout the system functionality uses condition code ranges to make decisions. In general the ranges are considered to
be:


-----

**Condition Range Start** **Condition Range End** **Description of Range**

000000 199999 No measurement

200000 299999 Missing Measurement

300000 499999 Estimated measurement

500000 999999 Regular measurement

The ranges of "No Measurement" and "Missing Measurement" at first glance sound synonymous but there is an important
distinction. With conditions that fall within the "No Measurement" range the expectation is that no measurement should
exist. Whereas, the "Missing Measurement" range implies that a measurement was expected but never received.

Note: in some circumstances, like rollover threshold errors, the regular range is further divided to include a "Superior" range
of 9000000 - 999999 which can be used to select the appropriate reading to be used to resolve the error.

During initial measurement processing the Final Measurement Replacement VEE rule can be used to increase the perceived
quality of a condition code. For example, the "No Read - Outage" condition which falls in the "No Measurement" range can
be considered higher quality than "Estimated Measurements" for the purposes of measurement replacement.

Refer to About IMD Validations for more information on the Final Measurement Replacement VEE rule.

###### Derived Values

Final measurements can record up to 10 derived values in addition to the "as measured" value. The derivation formula for
each value on a final measurement is controlled by the measuring component type.

Derived values are not reliant on consumption values, but can also come from factors, historical data, or another source.
For example, a set of measurements can be adjusted or converted into other units of measure. In the below example the
first derived value is the result of the application of a loss adjustment factor and the second derived value is the result of
applying a pre set formula against the loss adjusted value to compute BTU.


**Date/Time** **As Measured UOM: CCF SQI:**

**N/A**


**Loss Adjusted UOM: CCF SQI:**

**N/A**


**Thermal Units UOM: BTU SQI:**

**N/A**


01/01/2010 3:00PM 10 10.1 10.11

01/01/2010 4:00PM 15 15.15 15.165

01/01/2010 5:00PM 10 10.1 10.11

Refer to Understanding Measuring Component Types in the Administration Guide for additional information about
configuring derivation algorithms.

##### Reader Remarks

Initial measurements for manually-read scalar meters can create reader remarks. Reader remarks are a specific type of
device event used to capture and/or record specific events or circumstances encountered when a meter reader is manually
reading scalar meters.

Reader remark types are submitted with scalar initial measurements when received from a head end system or meter read
collection system. Reader remarks are NOT uploaded along with other device events. Reader remarks are always associated
with a scalar initial measurement.

Reader remarks can be passed onto to other subscribing systems such as a customer information system (such as Oracle
Utilities Customer Care and Billing), an outage system (such as Oracle Utilities Network Management System), or some
other application.

Like other device events, reader remarks can create service issue monitors.


-----

**NOTE:** Refer to About Service Issue Monitors for more information on Service Issue Monitors.

###### Creating Reader Remarks Manually

Use this procedure to create a new reader remark for an existing initial measurement.

Reader remarks must always be associated with an initial measurement.

Reader remarks are most often imported into the application with an initial measurement. However, users can also create
reader remarks using the following procedure.

**1. Search for and select the initial measurement that the new reader remark is to be associated with.**

**2. Click the Add link on the Reader Remarks of Initial Measurement zone on the Initial Measurement portal.**

**3. Select the reader remark type for the reader remark from the Reader Remark Type drop-down list.**

**4. Optional. If you need to create more than one reader remark for the initial measurement, click the plus sign, and select**
the reader remark type for the reader remark from the Reader Remark Type drop-down list. Repeat as needed.

Note that only a single reader remark of any given type can be associated with a single initial measurement.

**5. Click OK. The new reader remark is displayed in the Reader Remarks of Initial Measurement zone on the Initial**
**Measurement portal.**

##### Periodic Estimation

###### About Periodic Estimation

Periodic estimation is a process that scans eligible devices and their measuring components for missing measurements
that have not been received within a required amount of time. Once missing measurements are identified it then generates
estimation initial measurements to fill in those missing measurements. It is important to note that the periodic estimation
itself does not actually perform any estimations. It relies on the estimation initial measurement to generate the estimate
through the estimation VEE rules that are executed.

The periodic estimation process is as follows:

**1. Determine if measuring component is eligible for estimation.**

**2. Scan the eligible period for missing measurements.**

**3. Confirm missing measurements do not fall within a period where the device was not installed or was disconnected.**

   - For scalar measuring components, initial measurements are NOT created for disconnected periods.

   - For interval measuring components, initial measurements will be created or disconnected periods, but the intervals
will be marked as 'No Read - Disconnected' (Measurement Condition code 102000) and will be ignored for
estimation by VEE processing.

**4. Confirm there are no in progress initial measurements that cover the period of the missing measurements.**

**5. Either generate an initial measurement or a To Do for each measurement gap that is found.**

This process relies on an important date that is maintained on each measuring component:

- **Latest Contiguous Measurement Date/Time: this represents the last time the measuring component had a complete**
history of measurements without any gaps. By nature it implies that the is a gap immediately after it.

This date allows the periodic estimation process to efficiently identify those measuring components that are missing
measurements and need to be estimated.


-----

**NOTE:** It is possible to disable periodic estimation for a given device by updating the periodic estimation eligibility on
the service point it is associated to. This is useful if there are one-off service points that should either never be eligible
for estimation or should temporarily have estimation turned off.

###### Periodic Estimation Feature Configuration

The estimation begin date for interval and scalar periodic estimation can be influenced by a feature configuration option
under the feature type Measurement Data Options (D1MD).

When a No of Hours in Past to Retrieve Last Useable Measurement option is defined it will have two impacts on
periodic estimation, both of which are only applicable when the measuring component’s type does not have a value
configured for the Maximum Days to Estimate.

**1. When periodic estimation is run for a measuring component that does not yet have a Last Contiguous Measurement**
**Date Time then this option will be used to compute the beginning of the search range to find a useable measurement.**
That date is then used to begin estimation from.

**2. When running for a measuring component where the Last Contiguous Measurement Date Time is already set then**
this option will be used to compute the oldest date that estimation can begin from.

For both scenarios the begin date time calculation will be performed by subtracting the value configured from the current
Process Date Time. For example, if this option were set to 744 hours (31 days) and the process date time were 02/01
12:00:00AM then the begin date time would be calculated as 01/01 12:00:00AM.

When implemented this option will also instruct the Update Latest Date/Time on Scalar Measuring Component algorithm
type (D1-UPDDTSCMC), which is responsible for maintaining the latest measurement date time information for scalar
measuring components, to skip initializing the latest measurement date/time information when an initial measurement is
received for a measuring component where there is existing measurement data history and this feature configuration option
is configured. For those scenarios the initialization of the latest measurement date/time information should be deferred to
the Auto-Read Scalar Period Estimation process. Note: this only applies for situations when the latest measurement date/
time information has not been set previously and the initial measurement is not the first measurement received for the
measuring component.

**NOTE:** This does not apply to the analogous logic for an interval initial measurement.

###### Interval Periodic Estimation

When missing measurements have been identified by the interval periodic estimation functionality an estimation initial
measurement will be created for each contiguous set of missing measurements in the estimation period.

There are two methodologies available for estimating interval measuring components:


-----

- **Rolling Delay: In this method the execution time of the periodic estimation process is an important factor in which**
measuring components will estimate how far each measuring component estimate. This method supports a minimum
number of hours that will be estimated (as defined by the "Hours to Estimate" on the measuring component type).

- **Predictable Cut-off Time: In this method all measuring components for a measuring component type will estimate until**
a specified point in time (as defined by the "Cut-off Time" on the measuring component type). With this method the cutoff time determines how far estimations are made rather than the execution time of the periodic estimation process. There
is no minimum estimation size for this method it will always estimate up until the cut-off date/time even if that is only a
single interval.

The cut-off time takes into consideration daylight savings time (DST) when the device is configured as sending data in legal
time (meaning the Incoming Data Shift has been set to Always in Local). In these circumstances the cut-off time will be
considered to be adjusted for DST. This is important because measurement data is stored in standard. For example:

**Cut-off Time: 12:00AM** **Measurement Time in Standard**

01/15/2010 12:00AM (DST not in effect) 01/15/2010 12:00AM

04/15/2010 12:00AM (DST in effect) 04/14/2010 11:00PM

Furthermore, the cut-off time defined on the measuring component type does not have a time zone associated to it and as
such it is considered to be defined in the time zone of the particular measuring component being processed. For example,
a cut-off time of 12:00AM would be considered to be 12:00AM UTC -08:00 and 12:00AM UTC -05:00 based on the time
zones of the respective measuring components. This allows a single measuring component to apply to many time zones and
behave uniformly.


-----

**Algorithm Type – Create Interval IMD and To Do Based Upon Install History (D1-CIITBIH)**
Algorithms based on this algorithm type determine if a measuring component is missing final measurements during the
estimation horizon for any period where the associated device configuration was installed. If final measurements are
missing it will either create an estimate initial measurement, create a To Do Entry, or both.

There are a few scenarios that will result in this algorithm being used:

**1. If the measuring component’s service point has an Estimation Eligibility of Not Eligible**

**2. If the measuring component’s service point has open Estimation Suppression activities that overlap the System Date/**
Time and the MDM Master Configuration field Fill Missing Data with Zero is not set to “Yes”

**3. If the measuring component’s Latest Contiguous Measurement Date Time is greater than the process date time less**
the measuring component type’s Number of Hours to Wait

The estimation horizon begin date is determined by first determining the initial horizon start date time:

- If the Measuring Component Type’s Maximum Days to Estimate is configured it will be the more recent of the
following two dates:

  - The process date time less the Maximum Days to Estimate

  - The Measuring Component’s Latest Contiguous Measurement Date Time

- Otherwise, if the Measurement Data Option feature configuration type is configured with a value set for the No of Hours
**in Past to Retrieve Last Useable Measurement option then the start will be calculated as follows:**

  - If the Latest Contiguous Measurement Date Time is populated then take the more recent of:

    - The process date time less the No of Hours in Past to Retrieve Last Useable Measurement

    - The Measuring Component’s Latest Contiguous Measurement Date Time

  - Otherwise, if the Latest Contiguous Measurement Date Time is not populated then:

    - Search for a measurement between the following two dates:

     - Start: the process date time less the No of Hours in Past to Retrieve Last Useable Measurement

     - End: the process date time

    - If a measurement is found that date is used. Otherwise the process date time less the No of Hours in Past to
**Retrieve Last useable Measurement is used.**

- Otherwise, the Measuring Component’s Latest Contiguous Measurement Date Time is used.

- Otherwise, if the device is installed it will be set to the Installation Date Time of the Installation Event (IE).

The estimation horizon end date will be calculated based on the measuring component type’s Periodic Estimation
**Execution Method.**

**Rolling Delay:**

The more recent of the following dates will be used:

- The Latest Measurement Date Time plus the Measuring Component Type (MC Type) - Number of Hours to
**Estimate defined.**

- The Process Date Time less the MC Type - Number of Hours to Wait

- Estimations are limited by either a device configuration change or removal. Therefore, the date determined above will be
limited to the earlier of the device configuration Effective End Date Time or the Removal Date Time on Install Event.

**Predictable Cut-off:**

In predictable cut-off the intent is to only estimate up to the last cut-off time that has passed based on the Number of Hours
**to Wait from the measuring component type and no further.**


-----

First the process date time will be adjusted based on the Number of Hours to Wait configured on the measuring
component type. For example, if the process date/time is 01/15/2010 06:00PM and the Number of Hours to Wait is 48
then the adjusted process date/time is: 01/13/2010 06:00PM.

Next, the last cut-off time to have passed will be identified and that will become the estimation end date time. In our above
example this would be 01/13/2010 12:00AM.

Once the estimation horizon begin and end date times have been identified they may be further split into smaller periods
based upon the Measuring Component’s device configuration installation history.

For Example:

- Estimation horizon is April 10th at 12AM through April 20th at 12AM

- The Measuring Component’s device configuration was installed at one service point on April 1st at 12AM and removed
on April 15th at 12AM

- The Measuring Component’s device configuration was then installed at a new service point on April 18th at 12AM

- Given the above information the estimation horizon would be broken up into the following two periods:

  - April 10th 12AM through April 15th 12AM (this is for the first installation)

  - April 18th 12AM through April 20th 12AM (this is for the second installation)

Each of the estimation horizon periods determined based upon the installation history will be further examined to determine
contiguous periods where final measurements are missing.

For Example:

- Processing April 10th through April 15th

- One final measurement exists for April 12th for 8AM through 9AM

- Yields the following sub-periods:

  - April 10th 12AM through April 12th 8AM

  - April 12th 9AM through April 15th 12AM

- -For every missing period found,

  - Find Initial Measurements that are in a non Final state and the initial measurement’s period has an overlap with the
missing period.

    - For each initial measurement found,

     - If the initial measurement's period falls exactly within the boundaries of the missing period, skip the creation of
an estimate initial measurement for the missing period.

     - If the initial measurement's end date/time is before the start of the missing period, the initial measurement’s
end date/time is now the start of the missing period. Proceed to create an estimate initial measurement for the
adjusted missing period.

     - If the initial measurement's start date/time is after the start of the missing period, the initial measurement’s
start date/time is now the end of the missing period. Proceed to create an estimate initial measurement for the
adjusted missing period.

Each time Periodic Estimation is executed the Latest Contiguous Measurement will be validated and potentially updated.
For example, if it is before the install event’sInstallation Date Time, it will be updated to be the install event’s Installation
**Date Time.**

**NOTE:** If the Latest Contiguous Measurement Date Time falls within the installation window of a prior installation it
will not be adjusted to the current install event’s Installation Date Time.


-----

###### Scalar Periodic Estimation

Scalar periodic estimation is only available for automatically read scalar measuring components since it requires that scalar
measuring components be read on at least a daily basis to be eligible.

The scalar estimation process relies heaving on details from the measuring component type to identify when a measurement
is missing. This is because scalar measurements are not required to fall on specific boundaries like interval data. For
example, a scalar measuring component read on a daily basis around midnight could have measurements at 12:00AM,
11:55PM, 12:01PM or even at various other points during the day if a field reading or on demand read is performed.

Auto-read scalar measuring component types are configured to provide information that will:

- Identify at what point or points during the day the measuring component will be read. This is a combination of the Hours
Between Measurements and the First Daily Measurement Time on the measuring component type.

- Identify the allowable tolerance for measurements that do not fall on the specific expected measurement date/times (e.g.
11:55PM and 12:05AM are OK but 9AM is not). This is defined by the Early and Late Measurement Threshold on the
measuring component type.

This allows the scalar periodic estimation process to identify the points during the day that measurements are expected and
if no measurement are found it will generate an estimation initial measurement.

Unlike interval periodic estimation each missing measurement will be created as a separate estimation initial measurement.

The Early Measurement Threshold and Late Measurement Threshold fields support situations where a head end system
is not be able to report their readings at a consistent time each day. For example a head end system might send reads as
follows:

- 3/1 11:55PM

- 3/3 12:01AM

- 3/4 12:00AM

- 3/5 12:02AM

- 3/6 11:59 PM

These fields create a window prior to and after an expected reading where anything received within that window would
satisfy the expected reading. For example:

- For a measuring component with an Early Measurement Threshold of 00:10:00 (10 minutes), a reading for 3/1 11:55PM
would satisfy the early threshold for the 3/2 12:00AM expected reading.

- For a measuring component with an Late Measurement Threshold of 00:10:00 (10 minutes), a reading for 3/3 12:01AM
would satisfy the late threshold for the 3/3 12:00AM expected reading.

To determine if a measuring component is eligible for estimation the process will evaluate if the Last Contiguous
Measurement Date/Time far enough in the past. Specifically the number of hours elapsed since the Last Contiguous
Measurement Date/Time must be greater than or equal to the Hours Before Estimation from the measuring component type.

**NOTE:** The first daily measurement time takes into consideration daylight savings time (DST) when the device is
configured as sending data in legal time (meaning the Incoming Data Shift has been set to Always in Local). In these
circumstances the first daily measurement time will be considered to be adjusted for DST. This is important because
measurement data is stored in standard. For example:

**First Daily Measurement Time: 12:00AM** **Measurement Time in Standard**

01/15/2010 12:00AM (DST not in effect) 01/15/2010 12:00AM

04/15/2010 12:00AM (DST in effect) 04/14/2010 11:00PM


-----

Furthermore, the first daily measurement time defined on the measuring component type does not have a time zone
associated to it and as such it is considered to be defined in the time zone of the particular measuring component being
processed. For example, a first daily measurement time of 12:00AM would be considered to be 12:00AM UTC -08:00 and
12:00AM UTC -05:00 based on the time zones of the respective measuring components. This allows a single measuring
component to apply to many time zones and behave uniformly.

**Algorithm Type – Auto-Read Scalar Periodic Estimation (D1-ARSPE)**
Algorithm based on this algorithm type determine if a measuring component is missing final measurements during the
estimation horizon for any period where the associated device configuration was installed. If final measurements are
missing it will either create an estimate initial measurement, create a To Do Entry, or both.

There are a few scenarios that will result in this algorithm being used:

**1. If the measuring component’s service point has an Estimation Eligibility of Not Eligible**

**2. If the measuring component’s service point has open Estimation Suppression activities that overlap the System Date/**
Time and the MDM Master Configuration field Fill Missing Data with Zero is not set to “Yes”

**3. If the measuring component’s Latest Contiguous Measurement Date Time is greater than the process date time less**
the measuring component type’s Number of Hours to Wait

The estimation horizon begin date is determined by first determining the initial horizon start date time:

- If the Measuring Component Type’s Maximum Days to Estimate is configured it will be the more recent of the
following two dates:

  - The process date time less the Maximum Days to Estimate

  - The Measuring Component’s Latest Contiguous Measurement Date Time

- Otherwise, if the Measurement Data Option feature configuration type is configured with a value set for the No of Hours
**in Past to Retrieve Last Useable Measurement option then the start will be calculated as follows:**

  - If the Latest Contiguous Measurement Date Time is populated then take the more recent of:

    - The process date time less the No of Hours in Past to Retrieve Last Useable Measurement

    - The Measuring Component’s Latest Contiguous Measurement Date Time

  - Otherwise, if the Latest Contiguous Measurement Date Time is not populated then:

    - Search for a measurement between the following two dates:

     - Start: the process date time less the No of Hours in Past to Retrieve Last useable Measurement

     - End: the process date time

    - If a measurement is found that date is used. Otherwise the process date time less the No of Hours in Past to
**Retrieve Last Useable Measurement is used.**

- Otherwise, the Measuring Component’s Latest Contiguous Measurement Date Time is used.

- Otherwise, if the device is installed it will be set to the Installation Date Time of the Installation Event (IE).

The estimation horizon end date will be whichever of the following dates that is furthest in the past:

- Process Date/Time - Hours Before Estimation + Number of Hours to Estimate

- The device configuration’s effective end date/time

- The Off date/time of the device configuration's installation event.

Second, the algorithm identifies any expected measurement date/time without a final measurement or an in progress initial
measurement. For each missing measurement an Estimate initial measurement will be created. Estimations will only be
made for periods where the device is installed at a service point. If the Evaluate Installation Event Off Period parameter
has been set to 'N' or left blank then the device must also be turned on.


-----

To determine if there are any missing final measurements during the estimation horizon the algorithm uses the concept
of expected measurement date/times as explained above. If there are any expected measurements not covered by a final
measurements as dictated by the early and late thresholds then an initial measurement will be generated.

##### Measurement Reprocessing

###### About Measurement Reprocessing

One major problem utilities face today is when devices are installed with an incorrect consumption multiplier. When this
occurs, the billing consumption and the bills are incorrect retroactively.

The Measurement Reprocessing module automatically corrects historical consumption when a change is detected for either
a Measuring Component multiplier (the Register Multiplier for register measuring components or Channel Multiplier for
interval and auto-read register measuring components) or an Install Event Installation Constant or Installation Date/
**Time. The system monitors for these changes and automatically reprocesses historical measurements if one of the values**
changes. When a Measuring Component has been triggered for Measurement Reprocessing, a new message will be recorded
on the Log tab for the Measuring Component. The message will look similar to this example: "Measuring Component
Multiplier updated from 1.000000 to 2.000000. Measurements will be examined for reprocessing". Also, a link to the
activity created to perform the reprocessing will be shown in the Related Object column.

Two different Activities are leveraged to perform this reprocessing:

- **Measurement Reprocess Activity - Interval: this activity reprocesses interval data by dividing existing measurements**
by the Combined Multiplier stored on each measurement record and creates new System IMDs.

- **Measurement Reprocess Activity - Scalar: this activity reprocesses scalar data by creating new System IMDs from the**
Reading value stored on each measurement.

The new System IMDs that are generated will skip both VEE and Consumption Sync but will apply the new multiplier and
installation constant. Once the activity is finished, a list of the spawned IMDs will be displayed on the Activity screen.

This process works in tandem with the Adjustment Notification process to trigger billing adjustment notifications to the
CIS. If usage transactions have already been fulfilled once measurements are reprocessed, then each affected period will be
sent to CIS to indicate that an adjustment is required.

If desired, an approval step can be set as required on the related Activity Type. If set, a To Do will be generated for review.
The review steps for this To Do are covered in the Reviewing Measurements for Reprocessing section.

The diagram below helps to provide an overview of Measurement Reprocessing:


-----

For information on configuration, reference the related section for Configuring Measurement Reprocessing in the
_Administrative User Guide._

###### Reviewing Measurements for Reprocessing

When the Measurement Reprocessing Activity Types are configured as "Yes" in the "Approval Required?" field, then a To
Do will be generated for user review. The To Do Type for this is set on the Activity Type as well (the configuration for this
is covered in detail in the section for Configuring Measurement Reprocessing in the Administrative User Guide).

This To Do provides an approval step for a user to examine the Measurement Reprocessing Activity and perform the
following:

**1. Determine if the multiplier or date change appears legitimate and accurate. Information on the type of change that**
occurred can be found on the Log tab for the Activity. If the change should be rejected, this can be performed using the
**Discard button.**

**2. Ensure that the period being examined for reprocessing (shown as the Activity Start Date and End Date) covers the**
period expected. If not accurate, the dates can be changed using the Edit button.

If all information on the Activity is correct, then press the Approve button to allow reprocessing to continue. Once the
activity is finished, a list of the spawned IMDs will be displayed on the Activity screen.

Refer to About Measurement Reprocessing for additional functional information.

##### Consumption Sync


-----

###### Introduction to Consumption Sync

Traditional interval and smart meters are often configured with two channels of consumption data, one interval and the other
scalar. Utilities configure their meters this way for several reasons, including:

- Two channels provide for a redundant reading in case of a failure.

- Two channels provide for an independent check reading to ensure the meter is working properly.

- Customers often need both types of data for their business processes.

When capturing and storing usage for smart meters with related measuring components, one potential challenge is keeping
measurements from related scalar and interval channels synchronized. Measurements for interval and scalar channels for the
same device may fall out of alignment for many different reasons, such as:

**1. Some meters use different technologies for recording interval and register readings, so the physical readings can be**
different

**2. Readings can vary because of different measurement times**

**3. Estimation processes can vary by channel and produce different results**

**4. There can be a mix of actual and estimated measurements**

Having two sources of consumption data can cause many problems for utilities. Unfortunately, utilities often need both the
scalar and interval data to satisfy their business requirements. For example, scalar register readings may be used for billing,
while the interval data is used on a customer self-service portal.

Keeping measurement data aligned between two related measuring components is achieved in several ways:

- During the initial load of initial measurement data VEE rules estimate for missing measurements using measurement data
from related measuring components when available. Please refer to About IMD Estimations for more information.

- When measurement data is missing for one or both of the related measuring components the periodic estimation process
will generate estimation initial measurement data that will estimate one measuring component then estimate the second
measuring component such that the second measuring component's data can be synchronized with the first. Please refer
to About Periodic Estimation for more information.

- When new, more accurate, measurement data is received for only one of the measuring components the consumption
synchronization process will be initiated to align the previously estimated data with the newly received data. Note: this
process is what this section will be concentrating on.

Consumption synchronization is a process by which measurement data for related measuring component is kept
synchronized by re-estimating existing measurements when measurement data for related measuring components is
received.

For example, consider the following scenario:

- A meter has both scalar and interval channels, and the scalar register channel is considered the "primary" or more reliable
channel. The total consumption for each channel should match the consumption for the other channel.

- For a particular day, the daily reading for the "secondary" (interval) channel is received before reads from the scalar
register have been received. This reading contains two missing intervals, which are estimated during VEE.

- After the interval reading has been finalized, a scalar register reading for the same day is received. The total of this
reading is slightly different than the total of the interval reading due to the estimation of the missing intervals.

- The consumption synchronization process can trigger a re-estimation of the two estimated intervals to adjust the total of
the interval reading to match that of the scalar register reading.

Other examples of situations that can be resolved using the consumption synchronization process include the following:

- Register Readings whose start/stop times do not align with interval boundaries


-----

- A broken meter for which estimated readings are created for several days

- Requirements that readings from both channels match exactly even if neither contains estimated measurements

###### Primary Versus Secondary Measuring Components

When measuring components are related, one is considered the "primary" measuring component, and the other is considered
the "secondary" measuring component. How the consumption synchronization process works for a given meter is based
largely on which measuring component is considered primary and which is considered secondary.

The following are important principles regarding the primary/secondary measuring components:

**1. The primary measuring component has the more reliable data.**

**2. The secondary measuring component should validate that its consumption aligns with the primary measuring**
component.

**3. If the secondary measuring component needs to be estimated, it should estimate using the available data from the**
primary measuring component.

**4. When possible, initial measurements for the primary measuring component should be processed prior to those for the**
secondary measuring component (Note: the D1-IMD batch process will process initial measurements in this order).
In some scenarios when the secondary measuring component is read more frequently than the primary measuring
component, it can be advantageous to violate this principle in favor of being able to execute smaller more frequent loads
of measurement data.

**5. Periodic estimation should be performed on the primary measuring component first, and then the secondary measuring**
component.

###### Understanding Consumption Synchronization Processing

This section provides an overview of the process that supports keeping consumption for related measuring components
synchronized.

Note that the process outlined below has been simplified for illustrative purposes, and does not reference every step
performed in this process.

**1. An initial measurement is received (via initial load or manual) for a measuring component whose device configuration**
is consumption synchronization enabled.

**2. The consumption synchronization process evaluates the related "consumption reference measuring component" to**
identify any measurements for the time period of the initial measurement are consumption sync eligible (typically
estimated).

If eligible measurements are found a consumption synchronization activity is created. Note: the activity will not
immediately process it will remain in an initial status until a background process is executed.

**3. When the consumption sync background process is executed the activity initiates the re-estimation process by creating**
estimation initial measurements for each measurement that must be synchronized:

   - For scalar measuring components, this initial measurement contains no measurement value.

   - For interval measuring components, this initial measurement can contain a combination of "Regular" measurements
(based on existing final measurements) and measurements that require estimation (based on and corresponding to the
measurements with condition codes that fell between the range defined for "consumption synchronization" in step 2).

**4. Each estimation initial measurement that was created will execute the estimation VEE group rules to recalculate the**
synchronization eligible measurements.

#### VEE


-----

##### Introduction to VEE

###### About VEE

As measurements are received into Oracle Utilities Meter Data Management there is a need to ensure the data is accurate,
fill in any missing data with estimations, and flag any failures for review by users. The VEE (Validation, Estimation, and
Editing) process is the primary method for ensuring that these objectives are met.

VEE acts as a multi-layered filtration system for IMDs. Raw data is received from the Head End as Initial Measurement
Data and only clean, validated data is received on the other end in the Measurement table. The IMD has both a Pre-VEE and
Post-VEE section that details any data changes made as part of VEE.

Initial measurement data can come from different sources, such as a head-end system or estimation processes, or it can be
manually created by a user (to override or estimate consumption). Measurement data from these different sources might use
different VEE Rules. For example:

- Initial measurements sent a head-end system might use strict VEE Rules

- Initial measurements created by a user (to override or estimate consumption) may use less strict rules

- Initial measurements created by the system to estimate consumption have very few (if any) VEE Rules

To assist with this need, you can define different VEE Groups for different sources of IMDs. The base package roles are:


-----

- **Initial Load: Used for initial measurement data received from a head-end system or import process**

- **Manual Override: Used for initial measurement data manually created by a user or created by the reconciliation process**
for scalar or subtractive interval measuring component types

- **Estimation: Used for initial measurement data estimated by the system**

- **Projection: Used for "what if" services that are projecting future energy use for a measuring component**

Refer to About Initial Measurement Data for additional functional information about the reconciliation process.

A measuring component's Measuring Component Type can define "fallback" VEE groups for each of these roles. In
addition, an individual measuring component can specific a VEE group for each role. If the measuring component doesn't
have a VEE group specified for a role, the "fallback" VEE group defined for the measuring component type is used.

The VEE process has a number of different objects that are detailed below that allow for configurability and flexibility in
how the process executes.

###### VEE Groups

VEE groups are collections of VEE Rules that are applied to initial measurement data. During the VEE process, the system
executes the VEE Rules defined in each VEE group. The rules within a VEE group are defined in a specific sequence,
allowing control over the order in which the rules are executed.

VEE groups can be associated to a specific measuring component, or to a measuring component type (or both). VEE groups
associated with a measuring component type are applied to all measuring components of that type, while those associated
to a specific measuring component are applied only to that measuring component. VEE groups associated to a measuring
component override those assigned to a measuring component type.

For information on configuration, reference the related section for Configuring VEE Groups in the Administration Guide.

###### VEE Rules

The specific validation and estimation processing performed on initial measurement data is defined in individual VEE
Rules, each performing a specific set of targeted logic. The base product contains many VEE Rules you can use in your
implementation, but you can also create your own custom VEE Rules.

Some VEE Rules generate VEE Exceptions if the initial measurement data fails the conditions specified for the rule. Other
rules override measurements, changing measurement values as dictated by the rule's parameters. Some rules can both create
exceptions and override the measurement as part of a single process. By convention, VEE Rules change the Post-VEE
quantities of initial measurement data, but VEE Rules can change anything on an initial measurement.

For a list of validation VEE Rules, reference the About IMD Validations section. For a list of estimation VEE Rules,
reference the About IMD Estimations section. For a list of general VEE Rules that handle decision-making within the VEE
process, reference the Decision-making VEE Rules section.

For information on configuration, reference the related section for Configuring VEE Rules in the Administration Guide.

###### VEE Exceptions

Each VEE Rule defines an exception type and severity that specify how exceptions are tracked by the system. When an
initial measurement fails a validation, an exception of the type specified for the failed VEE Rule is created. A single initial
measurement can have multiple exceptions, one (or more) for each rule the measurement fails. This allows users to see all
of the problems detected during the VEE process.

There are three levels of severity for VEE Exceptions:

- **Info: Used to highlight something interesting, but not sufficient to cause the initial measurement to be put into the**
Exception state. Exceptions of this category can be used to report on the frequency of interesting, but not fatal issues.

- **Issue: Used to report a problem that will prevent the initial measurement from being finalized. Multiple "issue**
exceptions" can be created during VEE processing. If at least one issue exists after all rules have been applied, the initial
measurement is transitioned to the Exception state.


-----

- **Terminate: Used to report a severe issue that will cause the VEE process to stop and the initial measurement to be**
transitioned immediately to the Exception state. Only one terminate exception can be issued (as the first one causes VEE
to stop on an initial measurement).

Note that exceptions are not deleted when an initial measurement is adjusted or corrected. After any issues are corrected
or the initial measurement is overridden (or manually completed), the exceptions persist in a closed state for reporting
purposes.

For information on configuration, reference the related section for Configuring Exception Types in the Administration
Guide.

###### VEE Rule Eligibility Criteria

Each VEE Rule may optionally have eligibility criteria that controls if the rule is applied. This feature can greatly reduce
the number of VEE groups you need to create, because it allows a single VEE group to have conditional VEE Rules based
on eligibility criteria (rather than requiring a distinct VEE group for every combination of VEE Rules). Below are a few
examples of ways you can use eligibility criteria:

- You might create a rule that compares interval consumption against related scalar consumption (such as might be the
case with a device with both interval and scalar measuring components). This rule might use eligibility criteria that
specifies that the rule is only applied if the initial measurement's measuring component has a corresponding scalar
register measuring component.

- You might want to have a common VEE group but only have certain rules execute to execute based on Unit of Measure.
An eligibility criteria can be setup so that a VEE Rule only executed for kWh whereas is skipped for kVARh.

- Another example might be a rule that compares the current consumption against standard consumption for measuring
components of a certain type for the first six months after installation. You might create eligibility criteria that specifies
that the rule is only applied if the measuring component's Device Configuration has been installed at a Service Point for
less than six months.

For information on configuration, reference the related section for Configuring VEE Rules in the Administration Guide.

###### Decision-Making VEE Rules

In addition to the VEE Rule Eligibility Criteria, there are VEE Rules delivered as part of the base product that help
with decision-making when executing VEE (listed below). For more information on how each rule executes and can be
configured, follow the link provided on the rule.

**VEE Rule Name** **Purpose**

Exception Handler This rule allows for termination of the VEE process based on a
configurable set of exceptions being present for the IMD. This rule
also allows a unique To Do Type to be generated based on a group of
exceptions.

Execute VEE Group This rule performs a call to execute a separate VEE Group which
includes execution of all VEE Rules within that group.

Successful Termination This rule allows VEE to be successfully terminated based on a list of
exceptions.

VEE Group Matrix (Factor) This rule provides a way to choose different instances of a VEE Rule
using a Factor. This factor leverages characteristics that are defined on
Service Point, Device, or Measuring Component.

##### Validations


-----

###### About IMD Validations

Validation of the Initial Measurement Data on the way in to Oracle Utilities Meter Data Management occurs by leveraging
the diverse library of VEE Rules. Below is a list of the validation VEE Rules that are provided as part of base product. For
more information on how each rule executes and can be configured, follow the link provided on the rule.

**VEE Rule Name** **Applicable Data Type(s)** **Purpose**

Consecutive Interval Check Interval This validation rule flags any combination
of consecutive intervals within Initial
Measurement Data based on the values of the
data or the condition codes of the data.

Duplicate IMD Check Interval or Scalar This rule allows for a duplicate IMD to be
flagged.

Dynamic Comparison Validation Interval or Scalar This powerful, flexible validation rule
compares measurements to historical
statistics for the related Service Point. The
system will maintain statistics such as the
following: sum, min, max, average, median,
zero value count, outage count, and standard
deviation. Then you define formulas (no
programming required) for the comparison of
current measurements to these statistics.

Ensure IMD Exists for Sibling MCs Interval or Scalar This rule validates that an IMD exists for all of
the other measuring components associated
to the same Device Configuration as the
current measuring component, for the same
period of time.

Final Measurement Replacement Interval or Scalar This validation rule allows you to define
a variety of configuration options to
decide if new data should replace existing
measurements. The options include value
change thresholds, percentage change
thresholds, as well as condition code ranking.

High/Low Check Interval or Scalar This validation rule compares the total
consumption of the current IMD to historical
values. The comparison is normalized based
on average daily usage (ADU). If the current
IMD is too high or too low compared to
historical data then an exception is thrown.

Inactive Measurement Check Interval or Scalar This validation rule flags any Initial
Measurement Data received on a device that
is either disconnected, uninstalled, and/or not
connected to a Usage Subscription.

Interval Size Validation Interval This rule validates that the interval size
(in seconds) supplied with the Initial
Measurement is equal to the interval size
defined on measuring component's type.

Interval Spike Check Interval This rule checks for spikes within an IMD and
generates an exception if one is found.

Multiplier Check Interval or Scalar This rule validates that the register multiplier
supplied with the IMD is equal to the multiplier
stored on the measuring component. If not,
an exception is created using the register
multiplier exception type and severity
configured on the rule.

Negative Consumption Check Interval or Scalar This rule flags any IMD where the total
consumption is negative.

Prolonged Estimation Check Interval or Scalar This validation rule creates an alert when a
device has been estimated for an extended
period of time.

Raise Missing Quantity Exception Interval This rule flags any missing interval data.


-----

Sum Check Interval or Scalar This rule is used to compare the difference
between interval data to scalar data for a
period of time, or between a set of TOU scalar
reads to a "Sum" scalar reading.

Unit of Measure Check Interval or Scalar This rule checks the unit of measure (UOM)
passed in with the Initial Measurement against
the primary unit of measure configured on the
measuring component's type.

Zero Consumption Check Interval or Scalar This rule checks if the total consumption for
the IMD is zero. There is also a check for
whether an outage occurred during the same
time as the zero consumption to provide ways
to avoid exceptions in that case.

Refer to About VEE for additional functional information.

###### Reviewing and Resolving VEE Exceptions

All To Dos generated by a VEE Exception will link back to the Initial Measurement Data that originally failed to create the
VEE Exception.

Users have a number of options for dealing with initial measurements with exceptions.

- After correcting the cause of the issues that triggered the exceptions, a user can reinitiate the VEE process for the IMD
using the Perform VEE button.

- A user can Discard the initial measurement.

- A user can use the Force Complete button on the IMD in the scenario that they want to approve the exception and the
measurement information in the IMD. Note: No VEE processing is performed on initial measurement data that is force
completed. Regardless of the action taken by the user, the system will complete any open To Do Entries that created
when the initial measurement entered the Exception state.

Refer to About VEE for additional functional information.

###### Usage Transaction Validations

There are also validations available during the execution of usage calculation. For more information on these reference the
Reviewing and Resolving Usage Transactions section.

##### Estimations

###### About IMD Estimations

Below is a list of the estimation VEE Rules provided as part of base product that are responsible for filling the missing data
within an IMD. For more information on how each rule executes and can be configured, follow the link provided on the
rule.

**VEE Rule Name** **Applicable Data Type(s)** **Purpose**

Interval Adjustment From Scalar Interval This rule performs adjustments to interval
values based on the values from the
associated scalar data on the same device.

Interval Averaging Estimation Interval This rule finds historical interval data from
the same measuring component based on
a variety of configuration options to use for
estimating any missing data within an IMD.


-----

Interval Create Estimation IMD for Gap Interval This estimation rule creates a new Estimation
IMD to fill gaps between the interval data
received from the Head End.

**_Note: this estimation rule acts differently from_**
_the other rules as it creates a new IMD rather_
_than filling in missing values in an estimation_
_IMD created from periodic estimations._

Interval Interpolation Estimation Interval This rule attempts to interpolate gaps within
an IMD using prior and subsequent intervals
as starting points for linear interpolation.

Interval Profile Estimation Interval This rule estimates any missing interval data
for the IMD based on a referenced Profile
Factor.

Interval Proxy Day Estimation Interval This rule checks for days with similar
temperature and uses the measurement
data from those days as the basis of interval
estimation for the in-flight initial measurement.

Scalar Calculation From Interval Scalar This rule performs adjustments to scalar
values based on the values from the
associated interval data on the same device.

Scalar Estimation Scalar This rule finds historical scalar data from
the same measuring component based on
a variety of configuration options to use for
estimating any missing data within an IMD.

Scalar Profile Estimation Scalar This rule will estimate any missing scalar data
for the IMD based on a referenced Profile
Factor.

Scalar Proration Scalar This rule prorates the value of a scalar
reading that has two valid scalar readings on
either side as boundaries. It will also take into
account any related interval data within the
same period to exclude from the calculation.

Subtractive Interval Adjustment Rule Subtractive Interval This rule performs adjustments to qualifying
interval consumption values for subtractive
interval measuring components based on an
adjustment target calculated using a start and
stop reading for the period that encapsulates
the intervals to adjust.

Refer to About VEE for additional functional information.

###### Usage Transaction Estimations

There are also estimations available at the time of usage calculation. For more information on these reference the Reviewing
and Resolving Usage Transactions section.

##### Editing

###### About IMD Editing

At times, the values received in as Initial Measurement Data need to be edited by a user. This is covered in the Editing
Initial Measurements section.

If measurement data is found to be incorrect, a new IMD must be generated to correct the data. This is covered in the
Generating new Initial Measurements section.

Refer to About VEE for additional functional information.


-----

###### Editing Initial Measurements

Initial measurements can be manually edited via functions available in the Interval Initial Measurement Lens or Scalar
Initial Measurement zones in the Initial Measurement portal. Manual edits can include changes to the measurement values
or condition codes.

By default, manual edits made by users of these zones are not logged on the Log tab.

Refer to Configuring Measurement Logging for additional information on how initial measurement changes can be logged.

###### Generating New Initial Measurements

The main location for viewing measurements and generating new IMDs for any discrepancies is through the 360 Degree
View Measuring Component portal. On the portal many of the zones provide ways to apply measurement functions that will
generate a new IMD.

#### Usage

##### Introduction to Usage Calculation

###### About Usage Calculation

Oracle Utilities Meter Data Management can calculate and publish usage calculated from measurement data to service
providers on an ongoing basis. In addition, external systems can request usage whenever needed. Usage calculations derive
a usage transaction's usage quantities using the measurements linked to a usage subscription's service points.

Before bill determinants can be calculated, you must first create a Usage Subscription. The usage subscription defines the
external system to which the data should be sent as well as the usage calculation group that will be used for calculation.
The usage calculation rules defined for the usage calculation group are responsible for performing the specific calculations,
validations, or estimations for bill determinants.

Usage Service Quantities (bill determinants) are derived from the Measurements of the measuring components installed at
the Usage Subscription's Service Points during the calculation period. A Service Point is linked to measuring components
through an Install Event linked to the measuring components' Device Configuration.

The results of all calculations performed by Usage Subscriptions are stored as a Usage Transaction.

At any instance in time:

- A Usage Subscriptions may be linked to multiple Service Points

- A Service Point may be linked to a single Device Configuration

- A Device Configuration may have multiple measuring components

The calculation period for bill determinant calculations can span many days and over this period:

- The Service Points linked to the Usage Subscription can change (Service Points can be added and removed)

- The Device Configurations installed at the Service Point can change (due to device reconfigurations and meter
exchanges)


-----

This means that values for each Usage Subscription can be calculated using multiple Service Points and measuring
components.

The Usage Calculation process has a number of different objects that are detailed below that allow for configurability and
flexibility in how the process executes.

###### Usage Calculation Groups

Usage Calculation Groups are collections of usage calculation rules that are used to either calculate bill determinants or
validate bill determinants. During the Usage Transaction process, the system executes the usage calculation rules defined in
the usage calculation group referenced on the usage subscription. The rules within a usage calculation group are defined in a
specific sequence, allowing control over the order in which the rules are executed.

For information on configuration, reference the related section for Configuring Usage Calculation Groups in the
Administrattive User Guide.

###### Usage Calculation Rules

The specific calculation, validation, or estimation processing performed on a Usage Transaction is defined in individual
usage calculation rules, each performing a specific set of targeted logic. The base product contains many usage calculation
rules you can use in your implementation, but you can also create your own custom usage calculation rules.

For a list of validation usage calculation rules, reference the About Usage Validations section. For a list of estimation usage
calculation rules, reference the About Usage Estimations section. For a list of all other usage calculation rules that handle
calculation of bill determinants, reference the Inventory of Other Usage Calculation Rules section.

For information on configuration, reference the related section for Configuring Usage Calculation Rules in the
Administration Guide.

###### Usage Transaction Exceptions

Each usage calculation rule defines an exception type and severity that specify how exceptions are tracked by the system.
When a Usage Transaction fails some part of a usage calculation rule, an exception of the type specified for the failed usage
calculation rule is created. A single Usage Transaction can have multiple exceptions, one (or more) for each rule that failed.
This allows users to see all of the problems detected during the Usage Calculation process.

There are three levels of severity for Usage Transaction Exceptions:

- **Information: Used to highlight minor issues, but not sufficient to cause the Usage Transaction to be put into a failure**
state. Exceptions of this category can be used to report on the frequency of interesting, but not fatal issues

- **Issues: Used to report a problem that will prevent the usage transaction from being sent. Multiple "issue exceptions"**
can be created during usage transaction processing. If at least one issue exists after all rules have been applied, the usage
transaction is transitioned to a failure state requiring review and approval.

- **Terminate: Used to report a severe issue that will cause the Usage Calculation process to stop and the Usage**
Transaction to be transitioned immediately to a failure state requiring review and approval. Only one terminate exception
can be issued (as the first one causes calculation processing to stop on for a Usage Transaction). This should be used for
cases where manual override / approval isn't accurate. For example, a "Curve Not Continuous" error that says the interval
data doesn't cover the full usage period should always be set to Terminate as an Exception Severity.

Note that exceptions are not deleted when a Usage Transaction is adjusted or corrected. After any issues are corrected or the
Usage Transaction is overridden (or manually completed), the exceptions persist in a closed state for reporting purposes.

In addition to exceptions, usage processing can also trigger the creation of To Do Entries related to failed validations.
If Issue or terminate exceptions exist for an initial measurement, a To Do Entry is created when the usage transaction is
transitioned to the Exception state. The To Do Type and default To Do Role of this To Do Entry are defined on the Enter
system event for the Exception state of the business object used to define the usage transaction.

To Do Entries created in this way can be routed to different roles depending on the exception's message category and
number (using the To Do Type's Message Overrides tab).


-----

For information on configuration, reference the related section for Configuring Usage Transaction Exception Types in the
Administration Guide.

###### Usage Calculation Rule Eligibility Criteria

Usage calculation rule eligibility criteria are user-definable conditions that could cause a given usage calculation rule
to be applied or skipped. This can involve the evaluation of some attribute of the usage subscription or service point, or
something else entirely. A usage calculation rule can have multiple eligibility criteria for determining if the rule should be
applied or skipped, based on a user-defined sequence.

For information on configuration, reference the related section for Configuring Usage Calculation Rules in the
Administration Guide.

##### Usage Subscriptions

###### About Usage Subscriptions

A Usage Subscription is an ongoing request to send one or more Service Points' usage to one or more external systems. The
usage subscription defines which usage calculation group should be used to calculate service quantities (often referred to as
bill determinants).

Usage subscriptions must reference a:

- Service Provider. The service provider is used as the identity of the subscribing system. In other words, you must set up a
service provider for any system that subscribes to bill determinants.

- Contact: Contacts are individuals or business entities with which a company has contact. A contact exists for every
individual or business related to a usage subscription. A single usage subscription can have many contacts, and a single
contact may be referenced on many different usage subscriptions. Contacts have a 1-to-1 correlation with a "person" in a
customer information system (CIS) and the CIS is considered the system of record for contact information.

###### An Aside: No Account Object Exists

Oracle Utilities Meter Data Management is not considered the system of record for accounts or Usage Subscriptions. The
customer information system (or some other system) is considered the system of record for this type of information. In
order to minimize the amount of data that must be synchronized between systems, account and service agreement oriented
attributes used by the meter data products are held on Usage Subscriptions. For example, if an account's ID and its customer
class are relevant to usage calculations, each Usage Subscription must reference both elements. This is an important
distinction to keep in mind when creating custom Usage Subscriptions for your implementation.

Refer to About Usage Calculation for a broader functional view of the overall process.

###### Maintaining Usage Subscriptions

This portal is used to display and maintain a Usage Subscription.

Refer to About Usage Subscriptions or About Usage Calculation for additional functional information.

You can access the portal from Menu > Usage > Usage Subscription. You are brought to a query portal with options for
searching. Once your record has been selected you are brought to the maintenance portal to view and maintain the selected

Subscription Market Participants)

- **Sub Usage Subscriptions: Lists the first fifty "sub" usage subscriptions for the master usage subscription displayed in**
the Usage Subscription zone. This zone is only displayed for "master" usage subscriptions.

##### Usage Subscription Market Participants

###### About Usage Subscription Market Participants

Usage subscription market participants connects a Market, Market Participant and Usage Subscription together over a
specified date range. Usage subscription market participants can be created either via the Usage Subscription Market
**Participant portal, or by adding a market participant to a usage subscription via the Usage Subscription portal.**

Usage subscription market participants are defined by the following:

- **Usage Subscription: The usage subscription for which this usage subscription market participant was created.**

- **Market Relationship Type: The market relationship (Distributor, Supplier, etc.) of the market participant and its role**
within a market.

- **Start Date/Time: The start date/time for when the record is applicable.**

subscription

##### Usage Transactions

###### About Usage Transactions

Usage Transactions are records of bill determinant calculations for a Usage Subscription. All of the Service Quantities
calculated are stored as part of the Usage Transaction.


-----

Most requests for usage result in the creation of a usage transaction, but it is possible for an external application to invoke
the usage calculation engine real-time. In other words, usage can be retrieved for a usage subscription real-time without
creating a usage transaction. This technique is only recommended for online requests, not as part of batch processes.

###### Usage Calculation Group Determination

The first step in calculating the usage is to determine the usage calculation group holding the rules set used in calculating
or validating the bill determinants. There are two ways of configuring the usage calculation group to use in the processing.
It may be specified on the usage subscription during its creation with an effective and expiration date. If there are no
usage calculation groups in effect for the usage transaction, the fallback usage calculation group specified in the usage
subscription type will be used. The other way is to specify an algorithm – Determine Usage Calculation Group Override,
on the usage subscription type. This option provides flexibility in cases where special or custom logic will be required
to identify the usage calculation group. Base product delivered an algorithm that identifies the usage calculation group
based on the rate and installed device. Additional details can be found in the Detailed Description of the D2-DRVUSGGRP
Algorithm Type.

###### Calculation Period

Usage transaction requests must specify the date range for the usage transaction. This date range is referred to as the
calculation period for the usage transaction. The dates that define the calculation period are specified by a subscribing
system when it requests a usage transaction.

###### Multiple Device Configurations and the Calculation Period

In situations where a meter exchange has taken place at a service point, more than one device configuration can be in effect
during the usage transactions cutoff period (the time period between the End Date/Time From and End Date/Time To
values).

To account for this, the Meter Exchange Option on the Usage Subscription Type can be used to specify how the usage
calculation should handle multiple device configurations in effect during the cutoff period. If the flag is set to 'Defer
Calculation', new device configurations are excluded in the current usage transaction. If the flag is blank or set to 'Calculate
Usage', new device configurations are included in the current usage transaction.

###### Date Breaks

As noted above, date breaks are used to break up a usage period into sub-periods based on the dates on which rate changes
took place for the service point. For example, suppose a subscribing system requests usage for the month of January. The
customer for this request has an interval meter, and the customer's usage is calculated by applying a TOU map to their
interval consumption. The subscribing system detects that the customer's rate changed in the middle of January (on January
16) and wants the TOU consumption calculated in two "chunks" (before and after the rate change). Because the customer
has an interval meter, the exact consumption amounts before and after the rate change can be precisely calculated (as
opposed to calculating each period's amount by dividing the total usage by the number of days in each period).

One approach to this situation would be for the subscribing system to request two usage transactions (where each has the
desired date range). Another approach is for the subscribing system to request a single usage transaction with date breaks
that define the date ranges before and after the rate change. To continue the above example, a usage transaction could be
created with a date break on January 16.

If a usage transaction has date break(s), the usage calculation engine segregates the usage into multiple usage periods
based on the date breaks. If there are no date breaks in the usage transaction, a single usage period is created for the entire
calculation period.

As of the v2.0.0 release, the only way a usage transaction can have date breaks is if the subscribing system supplies these
when it requests usage (only the subscribing system knows if and when its prices and pricing rules change during the billing
period). If an implementation has additional criteria that causes date breaks, these criteria can be easily added to the usage
transaction's business rules.


-----

###### Service Quantities

Every usage period created for a usage transaction contains one or more service quantities. Service quantities are calculated
by the usage calculation group's rules specified for the usage subscription from which the usage transaction is created. For
example, a usage transaction might have service quantities calculated by a single rule that applies a TOU map to the kWh
channel on the device configuration installed at the service point.

Each service quantity lists details about that quantity, including a UOM (or TOU or SQI as appropriate) and a quantity. In
addition, each service quantity also references the source (measuring component) of the quantities (for audit purposes).

###### Service Quantity Rounding

The manner in which service quantities are rounded can be defined using the SQ Rounding Details parameters. These
parameters allow configuration of the method by which quanitities are rounded (Up, Down, or Nearest) and the number of
decimal positions retained after rounding.

###### Quality Assessment for Bill Print Options

Usage transaction service quantities can also contain information about the quality of the measurements used in their
calculations and other information that can be sent to an external customer information or bill print system. This information
is included in both the usage transaction and its related outbound message.

###### Quality Assessment

The Daily Scalar Usage Calculation Rule, Get Interval Data, Get Scalar Details, and Get Time of Use Mapped Usage
usage calculation rules include a "Perform Measurement Quality Assessment" option that indicates (yes or no) if the
measurement conditions of the measurements used when calculating usage should be evaluated and included in the resulting
usage transaction and outbound message. When enabled (set to "Yes"), the usage calculation rule algorithm evaluates
the condition codes of the measurements used in the calculation to determine if they fall within a "Regular" range of
conditions (this range is defined by the "Bottom Regular Condition Range" and "Top Regular Condition Range" algorithm
parameters). The result of this assessment is displayed in the "Data Quality Assessment" column in the Usage Periods
section which indicates if the service quantity is based on "regular" or "non- regular" data. (If the "Perform Measurement
Quality Assessment" option is disabled, the "Data Quality Assessment" column displays "No Assessment Done). In
addition, the "Source Measurement Quality List" column contains XML that contains a list of measurements aggregated by
condition/quality.

###### Maximum/Minimum Dates and Times

The Get Interval Data, Get Time of Use Mapped Usage, and Vector and Service Quantity Math usage calculation rules can
be configured to identify the date/time of the maximum or minimum measurement value used when calculating the service
quantity. For these functions, if "Max" or "Min" is selected as the "Calculation Function" (or the "Comax" and "Comin"
functions for the "Vector and Service Quantity Math" rule), the date/time of the maximum/minimum value will be included
in the resulting usage transaction and outbound message. The "SQ Highlight Date/Time List" column contains XML that
contains a list of maximum/minimum date/times, based on condition/quality.

###### Usage Transaction Export Configuration

Usage transactions can also include additional information about its related meters and service points, as well as an
indication if the service quantity is based on estimated usage. The "Usage Transaction Export Configuration" master
configuration is used to control the export of this data. It holds the device and service point business objects used to supply
meter and service point information included in the usage transaction and outbound message.

The "Usage Transaction Export Configuration" master configuration also defines the threshold percentage above which
a service quantity being exported via the usage transaction outbound message is marked as an estimate. For example,
of the "Estimation Threshold Percentage" is set to 35%, any service quantity being exported that was calculated from
measurements containing more than 35% estimated usage is marked "estimated".


-----

###### Service Quantities for Scalar Usage

Usage transactions and service quantities for scalar usage differ in some ways from those created from interval usage. For
example, suppose a subscribing system requests usage for the month of January for a customer with a scalar meter that has
been exchanged mid-month. In this case, the customer's usage is calculated by finding the scalar readings in the requested
period (including all meter exchanges), and the subscribing system requires a record of all scalar readings AND a total of
their consumption

Scalar rules cannot use date breaks because the system doesn't store interval values so it cannot accurately compute the
amount in each period. In this case, scalar usage calculation rules retrieve scalar readings for the service points linked to
the usage subscription, and then creates a single usage period for the usage transaction's entire calculation period. The
individual scalar readings are captured as "scalar details" in the usage transaction.

To continue the example above, there would be 2 entries in the Scalar Details, one for each meter, and a single usage period
that contains the total consumption for the entire calculation period. The tables below illustrate what this might look like.

###### Usage Estimation

When calculating usage for monthly read scalar meter, the end read may not be available by the end of the bill cycle
window. If the request indicated that estimated measurement is allowed, the Get Scalar Details usage calculation rule
creates an estimated end read that will be used to calculate the scalar usage.

###### Calculating Usage for Items

Usage transactions can also calculate usage for items installed at service points. Usage for items is calculated through use of
Get Item Counts and Consumption usage calculation rule. This rules calculate usage based on the number of items installed
at each service point and the average daily service quantity defined for each item's type. The specifics of how usage is
calculated for items is based on the service point category (defined on the service point type) at which the items are installed
(item or multi-item).

###### Hypothetical Calculations - Rate Comparisons

When Oracle Utilities Meter Data Management is integrated with Oracle Utilities Customer Self Service, customers can
perform rate comparison calculations to see the impact to their usage and billing charges based on a set of user-defined
usage adjustments. Rate comparison usage transactions are flagged "Hypothetical Calculation" in the Calculation Mode
field.

**_Profile Accumulation Usage Calculation Rules and Usage Adjustment Profile Factors_**

Rate comparison usage transactions can be created through the use of Profile Accumulation usage calculation rule. This rule
combine a service point's measurements with "usage adjustment" measurements derived from measurement data for profile
measuring components defined as characteristic values for one or more profile factors.

Usage adjustment profile factors are associated to usage adjustment types defined in the Usage Adjustment Type extendable
lookup and rates defined in the CC&B Rate Schedule extendable lookup (this association is defined in the Self-Service
Master Configuration). When the usage transaction is created, the rate determines the usage calculation group to execute
and usage adjustment profile factors to include in the calculation based on the CC&B Rate Schedule extendable lookup.

**Note: The Profile Accumulation usage calculation rule should be configured with eligibility criteria such that they are only**
executed when the Calculation Mode for the usage transaction is set to "Hypothetical Calculation" (D2HC).

###### Including Summary Service Quantities and Interval Data Snapshots with Usage Transactions

Usage transactions can be configured to include summary service quantities and an interval data "snapshot" along with
service quantities and other information sent to external systems. This used when sending usage to a billing system that
performs interval-based pricing calculations.


-----

Only usage transactions created (in whole or in part) by either the Get Interval Data or Vector and Service Quantity Math
usage calculation rules can include interval data snapshot information. These rules use the Extract Interval Data flag
to indicate ("Yes" or "No") if a "snapshot" of the interval data resulting from the usage calculation rule should be sent to
external systems when usage from the usage transaction is sent to external systems.

In the base package, the Usage Transaction Outbound Message (D2-UsageTranOutboundMesg) business object is used
to create outbound messages containing usage transactions. This business object includes the "Build Summary SQs" (D2BLDSUMSQ) Pre-Processing algorithm which calculates and creates the interval data snapshot and other summary service
quantities.

###### How Summary Service Quantities and the Interval Data Snapshot is Calculated

As noted above, the "Build Summary SQs" (D2-BLDSUMSQ) algorithm builds the Summary Usage Periods List based on
the usage transaction's details. For every usage period within the usage transaction:

An entry is inserted into the summary service quantity list for every distinct UOM/TOU/ SQI combination in the usage
period service quantity list.

An entry is inserted into the service point service quantity list for every distinct service point ID/UOM/TOU/SQI
combination in the usage period service quantity list.

Interval data for multiple service quantities are combined into a single interval data curve per UOM/TOU/SQI combination.
Intervals are summarized and scaled based on a common SPI

The "Build Summary SQs" (D2-BLDSUMSQ) algorithm uses the "Target Interval Size" parameter to define the interval
size of the combined curve when one or more curves are combined with different interval sizes. For example, when
combining interval data with 15 minutes intervals (SPI 900) and data with 60 minute intervals (SPI 3600), a Target Interval
Size of 60 minutes (SPI of 3600) would result in combined data with an interval size of 3600 (the 15 minute intervals would
be scaled up to 60 minute intervals before being combined with the 60 minute interval data).

Refer to About Usage Calculation for a broader functional view of the overall process. For information on how to configure
the request and response process for Usage Transactions, reference the Integrating Usage Transactions section of the Admin
Guide.

###### About Usage Validations

For the sake of keeping the volume of To Dos to a manageable level it may make sense to shift certain validations to the
usage transaction process rather than the IMD load process. The validation should be done on a usage transaction when
the result is only crucial for the systems receiving usage transactions rather than more real time needs such as online
presentation to a customer. Below is a list of the usage calculation rules used for validating usage transactions that are
provided as part of base product. To get more information on how each rule executes and can be configured, follow the link
provided on the rule.

**Usage Calculation Rule Name** **Applicable Data Type(s)** **Purpose**

Usage High/Low Rule Interval or Scalar This validation rule compares the Service
Quantities of the Usage Transaction to
historical values. If the current value is too
high or too low compared to historical data
then an exception is thrown.

Validate Against Tolerance Interval or Scalar This usage calculation rule is used to validate
the calculated usage against a tolerance
value. The tolerance value may either come
from the specified value or tolerance factor
defined in the usage calculation rule.

Business Flag Hold Interval or Scalar This usage calculation rule can stop a usage
transaction from proceeding when there have
been business flags for the applicable service
points. The hold can either be indefinite or set
to expire a configurable amount of time prior
to the calculation window ending.

###### Reviewing and Resolving Usage Transactions

This portal is used to review and/or resolve a Usage Transaction.

Refer to About Usage Transactions or About Usage Calculation for additional functional information.

You can access the portal from the Main > Usage > Usage Transaction. You are brought to a query portal with options for
searching. Once your record has been selected you are brought to the maintenance portal to view and maintain the selected
record.

The following zones may appear as part of the portal's Main tab page:

- **Usage Transaction: Defines basic information about the usage transaction, including usage period date ranges, date**
breaks within the usage period, scalar usage details, and usage quantity details.

- **Service Quantity Overlay: Displays interval data for each service quantity for the usage transaction's usage period**

- **Time of Use By Day: Displays TOU-mapped interval data by day for the usage transaction's usage period**

A number of important actions are available for a Usage Transaction depending on its status:

**Action** **Allowed Statuses** **Details**


Approve Approval In Progress

Issue Detected (only when the exceptions are
marked to require approval)

Re-Calculate Approval In Progress

Issue Detected


Allows a user to bypass any exception or
failure message for the Usage Transaction
and attempt to send it to the requesting
system.

Reruns the entire process of calculation along
with any validations (all usage calculation
rules) for the Usage Transaction.


Subsequent Correction Sent Allows a user to indicate that the usage
transaction was corrected after being sent.
Sets the status of the usage transaction to
Subsequent Correction.

Resend Send Error Allows a user to re-send a usage transaction
(via its related outbound message) to an
external system. Used when an error occurs
when sending usage transactions.

###### Triggering Adjustment Notifications

If any new Measurements are received from a device after that period has been calculated in a Usage Transaction then a
discrepancy exists between Oracle Utilities Meter Data Management and the external system (often a customer information
system or CIS). As a result, Oracle Utilities Meter Data Management provides a method to notify external systems of
these adjustments to Usage Transactions. A Usage Transaction Correction Processor activity is created for each usage
transaction that may have been impacted by an initial measurement. The Usage Transaction Correction Monitor batch
(D1-UTCRN) is used to process these activities.

On the External Application for CIS, a processing method of "Usage Trans Subsequent Correction Notification" must be
configured to specify the message that should be sent to notify CIS when an adjustment occurs for a Usage Transaction in
Oracle Utilities Meter Data Management.

The IMD process handles the logic to look for existing Usage Transactions to determine if an adjustment will be required.
The Usage Transaction will be moved to a "Subsequent Correction" status once this adjustment occurs.

###### Inventory of Other Usage Calculation Rules

Beyond validations and estimations usage calculation rules, the Usage Transaction process involves many other important
rules that prepare and calculate Service Quantities. A list of these rules is provided below. For additional detail, follow the
provided link that will take you to the Configuration Guide.

###### Pre-Calculation Usage Calculation Rules

Below is a list of the pre-calculation usage calculation rules provides as part of base product. For more information on how
each rule executes and can be configured, follow the link provided on the rule.

**Usage Calculation Rule Name** **Applicable Data Type(s)** **Purpose**

Alignment and Delay Calcluation Rule Interval or Scalar (Frequently Read) This rule can be used to handle two main

needs:

1) aligns all measuring components for

a Usage Subscription to the same date

(whether on the same device or separate

devices)

2) delays the usage transaction until the

end of the retry window based on the quality

of available data and other configured

parameters

Check Existence of Installed Device Interval or Scalar This rule checks for the existence of a device

installed on the Usage Subscription's Service

Point for the usage period. In the case of

multi-items this rule also checks that they are

effective for the usage period.

###### Calculation Usage Calculation Rules

The following is a list of the calculation usage calculation rules provided as part of the base product. For more information
on how each rule executes and can be configured, follow the link provided on the rule.

**Usage Calculation Rule Name** **Applicable Data Type(s)** **Purpose**

Apply Math (Interval Data) Interval This rule is used to perform calculations on

interval data and stores the results in the

usage transaction's service quantities. A

variety of options are available on this rule

that include defining the calculation type,

variables to use, as well as the equation to

use (math functions and expressions).

This rule provides aggregated usage for all

selected interval measuring components (filter

by TOU, SQI & UOM) associated to a usage

subscription.

This rule can also multiply total usage by a

factor using a custom formula.

Daily Scalar Usage Calculation Rul Scalar This rule is used to calculate usage of daily

scalar measuring components installed in


-----

the Service Points associated with a Usage

Subscription for the specified usage period.

It creates bill determinants by taking the

difference between the beginning and ending

reading for the bill period.

This rule can also be used to provide register

readings by measuring component.

For consumption values, only the beginning

and ending readings are exported

This rule supports date breaks (the normal

Get Scalar Data rule does not).

Get Interval Data Interval This rule is used to get interval quantities

from interval measuring components installed

in the Service Points linked to the Usage

Subscription for the specified 'Interval' usage

period.

This rule retrieves the interval data for

measuring components associated to a usage

subscription by TOU, SQI and UOM.

This rule converts the interval data to another

interval length or unit of measure.

Get Item Counts and Consumption Scalar This rule finds item-based and multi-item
based Service Points linked to the Usage

Subscription for the current usage transaction,

summarizes the item counts by item type

and Service Point, and calculates item-based

consumption.

Get Scalar Details Scalar This rule is used to get usage from scalar

measuring components installed in

the Service Points linked to the Usage

Subscription for the specified 'Scalar' usage

period.

This rule creates bill determinants by

summing all scalar readings for the bill period.

This rule can also be used to provide register

readings by measuring component. All

readings are exported by this rule.

Note: This rule is used for traditional monthly

read meters.

Get Subtractive Interval Details Subtractive Interval This rule is used to get interval quantities from

subtractive interval measuring components

installed on the service points linked to the

usage subscription for the specified 'interval'

usage period.

It also identifies the start and stop readings for

each usage period using subtractive interval

readings.

Get TOU Mapped Usage Interval This rule is used to get time of use quantities

from interval measuring components for

devices installed at the Service Points linked


-----

to the Usage Subscription for the specified

'Interval' usage period.

Interval Tier Calculation Interval This rule calculates the difference between a

source and reference vector.

This rule loops through each tier that is

configured and calculates the imbalance

amount associated to that tier level.

This rule breaks down that difference into one

to many positive or negative tiers, and create

a service quantity for each tier calculated.

Profile Accumulation Interval or Scalar This rule is used to manipulate a customer's

interval data by adding other vectors to

it. Those other vectors are derived from

a list of profile factors and corresponding

characteristic values stored in a list on the

usage transaction.

Round and Adjust Usage Interval or Scalar This rule copies identified source and target

Service Quantities and inserts these as

Service Quantities that are rounded and

adjusted.

Vector and Service Quantity Math Interval This rule is designed to facilitate configuration

of complex vector calculations. It is based on

a series of underlying services with vectors

configured as input to the calculations.

Typical uses:

Perform math using interval data, e.g., take

the difference between two curves, find max

values, find coincident peaks, multiply a curve

by a value, apply TOU maps, etc.

Define complex formulas using various

interval curves, profile factor values or

calculated service quantities (bill determinant

values).

Support math functions: sin, cos, square root,

etc.

Store derived curves in memory that can be

used in subsequent calculations

Please note, this rule is not as efficient as

other rules.

###### Decision-Making Usage Calculation Rules

There are usage calculation rules delivered as part of the base product that help with decision-making when executing
running the usage calculation process. For more information on how each rule executes and can be configured, follow the
link provided on the rule.

**Usage Calculation Rule Name** **Purpose**


-----

Execute Usage Calculation Group This rule performs a call to execute a separate usage calculation group

which includes execution of all usage calculation rules within that

group.

Exception Handler This rule evaluates the exception list that was accumulated during the

execution of the calculation rules against exception criteria configured

on this rule.

##### Usage Requests

Usage request records are created when bill determinants are requested during billing. The consumption information is then
used to create a bill segment for the associated service agreement.

Refer to The Big Picture of Usage Requests for more details

Use Menu > Usage > Usage Request to open this page. When you select a usage request record, the maintenance portal
opens and displays the associated information for the usage request record. You can also navigate to the maintenance portal
from the Bill Segment - Usage page.

Refer the embedded help on this portal’s zones for more information.

##### Usage Calculation Requests

###### About Usage Calculation Requests

Usage calculation request are calculations executed at a customer level where there may be more than one calculation
per usage subscription. For example, a customer may have a usage subscription for producing billing determinants but
there may be additional calculations that will be executed on a much less frequent basis (annually, quarterly, etc). More
specifically, usage calculation requests are used to calculate service point quantities (see About Service Point Quantities for
more information).

Usage calculation requests are defined by the following:

- **Usage Calculation Type: The usage calculation type for the request. Usage calculation types define the service point**
quantity type and UOM/TOU/SQI for quantities calculated for requests of that type.

- **Start Date/Time: The start of the date range for the request.**

- **End Date/Time: The end of the date range for the request.**

###### Maintaining Usage Calculation Requests

You use the Request portal to view and maintain usage calculation requests.

Refer to About Usage Calculation Requests for additional functional information.

You can access the portal from the Main > Usage > Usage Calculation Request. You are brought to a query portal with
options for searching. Once your record has been selected you are brought to the maintenance portal to view and maintain
the selected record.

This portal includes the following zones:

- **Request: defines the basic attributes of the usage calculation request**


-----

- **Request Log: lists log activities for the usage calculation request**

##### Usage Subscription Quantities

###### About Usage Subscription Quantities

Usage subscription quantities are quantities that are stored at the usage subscription level. These quantities are calculated
at irregular frequencies (such as annually or quarterly) and thus do not make sense as a measured quantity on a device
and measuring component. For example, in some deregulated markets the Peak Load Contribution could be stored here
and effective dated over time to represent the changing contribution of a given usage subscription to the market wide
coincidence peaks.

Usage subscription quantities are defined by the following:

- **Usage Subscription: The usage subscription for which the quantities were calculated**

- **Usage Subscription Quantity Type: The Usage Subscription Quantity Type used for the record**

- **Start Date / End Date: The date range for the calculated quantity**

- **Usage Subscription Quantities: Calculated quantities based on Quantity Identifiers configured on the Usage**
Subscription Quantity Type (see Understanding Usage Subscription Quantity Types for more information)

**NOTE:** There cannot be more than one Usage Subscription Quantity for the same Usage Subscription and Usage
Subscription Quantity Type, for the same time period (defined by the Start Date and End Date parameters).

###### Maintaining Usage Subscription Quantities

You use the Usage Subscription Quantity portal to view and maintain usage subscription quantities.

Refer to About Usage Subscription Quantities for additional functional information.

You can access the portal by selecting Main, then Usage, then Usage Subscription Quantity. You are brought to a query
portal with options for searching. Once your record has been selected you are brought to the maintenance portal to view and
maintain the selected record.

The following zones may appear as part of the portal's Main tab page:

- **Usage Subscription Quantity: This zone displays the basic attributes of the usage subscription quantity**

##### Time of Use Maps

###### About Time-of-use Processing

A type of rate used at many utilities is known as a "time of use" rate. For these rates, the price is based on when the usage
occurs. For example, prices are typically higher during peak consumption periods (commonly referred to as "On Peak"
periods) to encourage lower use during these times. The time range when a given price is applicable is known as a time-ofuse (TOU) period.

Time of use periods can (and often do) change during the year. For example, in the summer, TOU periods might be defined
as follows:

**Time Of Use Period** **Time Periods**


-----

On Peak 8:00 AM - 9:00 PM Monday - Friday

Off Peak 12:00 AM - 8:00 AM Monday - Friday

9:00 PM - 12:00 AM Monday - Friday

12:00 AM - 12:00 AM Saturday, Sunday, and Holidays

While winter TOU periods might be defined as follows:

**Time Of Use Period** **Time Periods**

On Peak 11:00 AM - 5:00 PM Monday - Friday

Off Peak 12:00 AM - 11:00 AM Monday - Friday

5:00 PM - 12:00 AM Monday - Friday

12:00 AM - 12:00 AM Saturday, Sunday, and Holidays

This is an example of a "simple" mass-market time-of-use schedule. Commercial and industrial schedules can be much
more complex.

Generally speaking, there are two different types of meters that can be installed at service points that participate in TOU
rates:

Scalar meters with dedicated registers for each TOU period. For this type of meter, the scalar measurements are the TOU
consumption and no special derivation is necessary. The assumption is that the TOU schedule is programmed into the
device and no TOU Map is required within Oracle Utilities Meter Data Management.

Interval meters that measure how much is consumed each interval. For this type of meter, the interval measurements
are used to derive the consumption in each TOU period based on the TOU Map defined in Oracle Utilities Meter Data
Management.

For information on configuration, reference the related section for TOU Mapping in the Administration Guide.

###### About TOU Maps

Interval consumption is mapped into time-of-use periods using a TOU map. TOU maps define the TOU periods for each
interval. TOU map data is structured in a format very similar to final measurement data, with specified intervals of time
each designated to a TOU period (instead of a measurement value). For example, the table below lists a set of TOU map
data and corresponding final measurements for a period of 4 hours on January 1, 2010.

**TOU Map** **Measuring Component**

**Date/Time** **TOU Code** **Date/Time** **Consumption**

1-Jan-10 3:00pm ONPEAK 1-Jan-10 3:00pm 14.678

1-Jan-10 4:00pm ONPEAK 1-Jan-10 4:00pm 29.12

1-Jan-10 5:00pm ONPEAK 1-Jan-10 5:00pm 12.12

1-Jan-10 6:00pm OFFPEAK 1-Jan-10 6:00pm 17.16

Any type of final measurement can be mapped to a TOU period, including derived quantities. While the principal
requirement for TOU Maps is to aggregate interval consumption into TOU periods for a Usage Transaction, the system has
many zones in the user interface that display interval consumption using TOU periods.

###### Maintaining TOU Maps

This portal is used to display and maintain a TOU Map.

Refer to About TOU Maps for additional functional information.

You can access the portal from Menu > Usage > TOU Map. You are brought to a query portal with options for searching.
Once your record has been selected you are brought to the maintenance portal to view and maintain the selected record.

The following zones may appear as part of the portal's Main tab page:


-----

- **TOU Map: Defines basic information about the TOU map, including dynamic options**

- **TOU Map Data List: Lists TOU map data created from the TOU map**

The Time Of Use Map Data Generation Monitor batch (D1-TOUTR) is used to generate TOU Map data automatically
based on the TOU Configuration. TOU Map data can also be generated manually through the TOU Map Portal in the UI.

##### Dynamic Options

###### About Dynamic Options

Dynamic Options specify terms that override how usage is normally calculated, such as a critical peak period that affects the
TOU mapping of interval consumption.

There are circumstances and conditions during which the rules for creating TOU map data might need to be calculated
differently than according to the utility's standard rules. Examples of this might include critical peak periods, curtailment
requests or other demand response events. During these types of events, the TOU rules defined for a TOU map may be
overridden. This is done through the use of dynamic options and dynamic option events.

Dynamic options allow flexibility for ad-hoc and special events that might impact how usage calculations are performed.
For example, if a utility requests that its customers curtail their usage for a specific time period, a dynamic option and
corresponding dynamic option event could be used to represent the curtailment request. During the time period of the
curtailment request, usage might be calculated differently (with a different set of TOU periods, for example), which in turn
might impact how the customer's bill is calculated.

###### Dynamic Options and TOU Maps

To apply a dynamic option (and one or more of its related dynamic option events), you reference the dynamic option on a
TOU map, along with a corresponding "dynamic" TOU map to be used during the dynamic option event.

For example, with Critical Peak Periods you might add a new TOU period (called "Critical Peak"), and create a new TOU
map that is the same as your standard TOU map, but that also includes your Critical Peak TOU period. For example, in the
summer your new set of TOU periods might be defined as follows:

**Time Of Use Period** **Time Periods**

Critical Peak 10:00 AM - 2:00 PM Monday - Friday

On Peak 8:00 AM - 10:00 AM Monday - Friday

2:00 PM - 9:00 PM Monday - Friday

Off Peak 12:00 AM - 8:00 AM Monday - Friday

9:00 PM - 12:00 AM Monday - Friday

12:00 AM - 12:00 AM Saturday, Sunday, and Holidays

If a dynamic option event occurs during a usage transaction period, the standard TOU map is overridden with the "dynamic"
TOU map. In our example, a usage transaction period that includes August would use the dynamic TOU map when
generating TOU map data for the time between 10:00 AM and 2:00 PM on August 2, but would use its standard TOU map
for the rest of the month.

###### About Dynamic Option Events

Dynamic Option Events are specific periods of time during which a dynamic option is applicable.


-----

There are circumstances and conditions during which the rules for creating TOU map data might need to be calculated
differently than according to the utility's standard rules. Examples of this might include critical peak periods, curtailment
requests or other demand response events. During these types of events, the TOU rules defined for a TOU map may be
overridden. This is done through the use of dynamic options and dynamic option events.

A dynamic option may have many dynamic option events over time.

##### Consumption Extract Requests

###### About Consumption Extract Requests

Consumption Extract Requests are created every time measurement or interval data is extracted for Oracle Utilities
DataConnect or via Configurable Consumption Extracts. The consumption extract request can be created manually,
typically to initiate an initial load type of extract, or created automatically, typically for an incremental type of extract,
based on a configuration on the consumption extract type.

The Consumption Extract Request is responsible for submitting and monitoring the actual batch jobs that perform the data
extract. In addition, it can be used to store any additional filters to further trim down data that will be extracted.

Refer to the Oracle Utilities DataConnect integration section in the Administrative User Guide for more details on how
consumption extract requests are used with DataConnect.

Refer to Configurable Consumption Extracts in the Administrative User Guide for more information about how they are
used with configurable consumption extracts.

##### Using Unified Search

The Unified Search feature allows you use the toolbar search field to search for business entities as well as search for menu
items. See Unified Search in the User Interface Standard Features section for more information about the general use of the
unified search field.

In Oracle Utilities Meter Data Management and Oracle Utilities Meter Solution Cloud Service, the Unified Search field
allows searching by a service point's address (Address), a usage subscription's contact (Name), or a meter’s badge number
(Badge Number) or serial number (Serial Number).

You can use the following filters to indicate your specific search criteria:

**Filter** **Filter Rule**

Address One or more numeric characters followed by space and an
alphanumeric character

Name Minimum of 5 characters excluding whitespaces

Badge Number Minimum of 5 characters excluding whitespaces

Serial Number Minimum of 5 characters excluding whitespaces

For example, to search for a service point located at 1401 Flower Street, you could enter “1401 Flower”.

To search explicitly using a specific filter, precede the filter value with one of the following predefined hints:

**Filter** **Hint** **Example**

Address ad: ad:1401 Flower

Name n: n:Smith, J

Badge Number bn: bn:12345

Serial Number sn: sn:6789

Examples:

- To search for a service point located at 1401 Flower Street, you could enter "ad:1401 Flower" (hint) or “1401
Flower” (no hint)

- To search for a person named John Smith, you could enter "n:Smith, J" (hint) or “Smith,J” (no hint)

- To search for a meter whose badge number is 12345, you could enter "bn:12345" (hint) or “12345” (no hint)

#### Service Orders

In this section, we describe how to manage the fieldwork that takes place at your premise's service points.


-----

##### About Service Order Activities

Service order activities represent specific service order requests either received from an external system or created from
within Oracle Utilities Smart Grid Gateway.

Service order activities are created when specific types of requests for service are received in the system. These activities
orchestrate the steps necessary to fulfill the request, based on the current state of the service point related to the request.
For example, the system creates an "enable service" activity when a request is made to enable service at a particular
service point. This activity examines the current state of the service point, and creates one or more additional activities if
appropriate. For example:

- If there is no meter currently installed at the service point, the service order activity would create an "install meter"
service order field activity and send it to a field work system.

- If there is a meter installed, but the meter is not currently registered with the head end system, the service order activity
might create a "commission meter" smart meter command.

- If the meter is active and commissioned, but not currently connected, the service order activity might create a "remote
connect" smart meter command.

- Etc.

Service order requests are typically received from the customer information system such as Oracle Utilities Customer Care
and Billing, but can also be created from within Oracle Utilities Meter Data Management or Oracle Utilities Smart Grid
Gateway.

The base package provides the following types of service order orchestration activities:

- Enable Service: Used to enable service at a service point.

- Disable Service Used to disable service at a service point.

- Cut for Non-Payment: Used to cut off service at a service point due to non-payment of past due amounts.

- Reconnect Service for Payment: Used to restore service at a service point after receipt of past due payment.

- Exchange Meter: Used to orchestrate the exchange of meters at service point, such as in the event that a customer
upgrades their meter.

- Back to Back Service: Used to orchestrate a change of service when the customer at a service point changes (such as
when owners/tenants change).

Service order orchestration activities are defined by the following:

- **Activity Type: The service order's activity type.**

- **Service Date/Time: The date and time the service order request was received.**

- **Service Point: The service point associated with the service order request.**

- **Service Agreements: A list of one or more service agreements related to the service order request (not used with all**
service order orchestration activities).

- **Request Information: Details of the service order request, including requester and external system information.**

- **Collection Data Details: Details regarding past due balances (used with Cut for Non-Payment activities only).**

- **Contact Details (or Customer Information): Contact details for the customer associated with the service order request.**

Note: Some service order activities use additional data.

In the event that an active service order activity needs to be updated and/or cancelled, the system also supports the following
maintenance service order activities:


-----

- Cancel Orchestration: Used to cancel a currently active service order activity.

- Update Orchestration: Used to update a currently active service order activity.

Service order maintenance activities are defined by the following:

**Activity Type: The service order's activity type.**

**Orchestration Activity: The original orchestration activity related to the maintenance activity.**

**Related Activity: A specific activity (such as a service order field activity or smart meter command) related to the**
maintenance activity.

**Cancel Reason: The reason for cancelling the original activity (for cancel activities only).**

**Comments/Instructions: Specific comments and/or instructions applicable to the maintenance activity (for update**
activities only).

**Start Date/Time: The date and time the maintenance activity was initiated (for update activities only).**

**Request Information: Details of the service order request, including requester and external system information.**

**Activity Hierarchy: A tree that displays the activity and related activities (including service order field activities and smart**
meter commands), inbound and outbound communications, and completion events.

##### How Are Service Order Activities Created?

Service order activities are typically created due to a field activity request as follows:

- Starting or stopping service indirectly causes field activity requests to be created. These field activity requests initiate the
service orders to orchestrate the actions necessary to connect or disconnect service. Refer to Starting Service and Field
Activities for more information about how field activity requests are created to start and stop service.

**NOTE:** If you use the Order transaction to start service, field activity requests will also be created in the same
manner described under the Starting Service and Field Activity Requests discussion

- The activation of a severance event with fieldwork causes field activity requests to be generated to disconnect or
reconnect service. For more information about severance events and field activity requests, refer to The Big Picture Of
Severance Events).

Service order activities can also be created due to a request received from an external system or created directly within
Oracle Utilities Smart Grid Gateway.

##### About Service Order Field Activities

Service order field activities are specific types of tasks performed by field personnel. Examples include installing meters,
repairing/replacing meters, etc.

Service order field activities are created when completing specific types of requests for service requires field work. Once
created, service order field activities are sent to a field work system, where they are scheduled and assigned to a field work
crew. When the task is completed by the crew, the field work system sends an response to the system and the service order
field activity is updated as appropriate.

When communicating with field work systems, service order field activities create outbound communications to send
the required information to the field work system. When the field work system sends its response, the system creates an
inbound communication. See About Communications for more information about communications. Service order field
activities that have created outbound communications can also be manually completed or canceled if necessary.


-----

Service order field activities are created when a service order orchestration activity examines the current state of the service
point, and determines that field work is required to complete the service request. For example, if an "enable service" activity
determines that there is no meter currently installed at the service point, the service order activity would create an "install
meter" service order field activity and send it to a field work system.

Service order field activities are defined by the following:

- **Activity Type: The service order field activity type.**

- **Status: The current status of the service order field activity.**

- **Service Date/Time: The date and time the service order field activity was created.**

- **Service Point: The service point associated with the service order field activity.**

- **Field Task Type: The field task type for the service order field activity. The list of available field task types can be**
filtered based on the Valid Field Task Types defined for the service point’s service point type via the Restrict Field
**Task Type by Service Point Type option on the Service Order Management Master Configuration.**

- **Recipient: The service provider to which the service order field activity is sent for scheduling and assignment.**

- **Device: The device related to the service order field activity (if applicable).**

- **Request Information: Details of the service order request, including requester and external system information.**

- **Contact Details (or Customer Information): Contact details for the customer associated with the service order request.**

- **Address Information: The address of the service point associated with the service order field activity.**

##### What Happens After A Field Activity Is Completed?

When a service order activity completes, if there is a related field activity request this will also be completed. Completing
a field activity request that is linked to a pending start service agreement, will also automatically activate the service
agreement. Similar, completing a field activity request linked to pending stop service agreements will stop the associated
service agreement.

After a field activity that is linked to a severance event is completed, the severance event becomes complete. This, in turn,
triggers the activation of the next event.

**FASTPATH:**
For more information about field activities linked to pending starts, refer to Starting Service and Field Activities.

For more information about field activities linked to pending stops, refer to Stopping Service and Field Activities.

For more information about severance events and field activities, refer to The Big Picture of Severance Events.

##### About Appointments

The Appointment Booking portal is used to request and track appointments related to service order field activities that have
been scheduled in an external field work scheduling system.

When service order field activities send outbound communications to the field work system, appointments are created
in field work system so that the work can be assigned to a crew. Requests for appointments are most often requested
automatically when the service order field activity is created, but if needed, users can request appointments manually.

Users work with the Appointment Query portal to search for activities and related appointments.

Users work with the Appointment Booking to request and track appointments for service order field activities. This portal
includes the following zones:


-----

- **Service Point Activities: Displays a list of activities and related appointments for the current service point in date**
descending order. This zone also includes a filter area which allows the user to define the inclusion or exclusion of
activities according to certain criteria

- **Activity Summary: Displays details of a selected activity in the Service Point Activities zone (indicated by a star).**

- **Appointment Booking Results: Displays a list of available appointment slots as returned by the scheduler. This zone**
allows the user to book an appointment by selecting a slot and subsequently updating the orchestration or field activity.

##### Field Activity Maintenance

A field activity request is a request to perform actions at a service point. Examples of field activity requests include start
service, stop service, and start/stop.

The topics in this section describe the pages on which field activity request-related information is maintained.

###### Lifecycle of a Field Activity

The following diagram illustrates the lifecycle of a field activity.

**Pending: A field activity starts its life in the Pending state.**

**Complete: After the related actions have been performed, the system is updated to reflect what happened and the field**
activity request becomes complete. No changes may be made to a Complete field activity request.

**Canceled: A Pending field activity request may be Canceled..**

###### Field Activity - Main Information

The Main page contains core field activity information.

**Description of Page**

The following fields are displayed on every page.

###### The Service Call Process and Service Call Communication

 Service Call Process

The service call process contains five steps or panels:

**Service Call Search. This panel is used input the contact details of the service call.**

At least one filter should be populated before search can be performed.

The result is a combination of the following:

- Service calls in the asset system retrieved via a real-time call.

- Local non-final service calls that were not sent to the asset system yet.

By default, the maximum number of search results is 20. This can be overridden by setting the override search limit in the
service call communication type.

The service call information includes the service call number, issue description, required by date and call back indicator.
Service call number is the service call's reference number in the asset management system.

**NOTE:** The details of a service call can be viewed using the View Service Call Details icon. This pops up a window
with the details of the service call. Details of service calls in the asset management system are retrieved via real-time call
and includes communication logs and related documents. For authorized users, hyperlink to the service call in the asset
management system is available. Refer to Setting Up the System To Enable Asset Management System Integration for
more details.

When a service call is selected, either Add Comment or Cancel action should be selected to continue.

Continuing without selecting a service call means a new service call.

**Location. This panel is used to input or display the location of a new or existing service call, respectively. For an existing**
service call, the location details are displayed for information purposes.

When the process is initiated with a premise in context, the premise is displayed and can be used to populate the location
elements and limit the service points that can be selected. If the current premise is used, the location elements are populated
and disabled. The geographic type defined in the service call communication type is used to populate the latitude and
longitude elements based on the premise's geographic data.

When service point is set, the location elements are populated with the corresponding elements of the service point's
premise and are disabled. Clearing the service point will re-enable the location detail elements with their values retained.
The geographic type defined in the service call communication type is used to populate the latitude and longitude elements
based on the premise's geographic data.

Country and address should be populated to continue.

**Contact. This panel is used input the contact details of the service call.**

Communication type is defaulted to the default communication type defined in the service call communication type.

When the process is initiated with a person in context, the person is displayed and can be used to populate the name and
phone numbers. If the current person is used, the name and phone number elements are populated and disabled:

- First and last names are derived from the person's primary name. Note that installation option's name separator
configuration applies.


-----

- Primary phone is set to the person's primary phone contact

- Mobile and home phones are set to the person's phone contact where the contact type is the mobile and home phone
contact types defined in the service call communication type, respectively.

Contact details are not required to continue. For Add Comment or Cancel actions, either First Name or Last Name or one
of the phone numbers must be provided.

**Details. This panel is used to capture the issue details of the service call.**

For a new service call, enter the details of the issue. Questions linked to the selected service code are presented. Set the
resolved switch if based on the answers to the questions, the issue is resolved. Doing so will prevent a message from being
sent to the asset system.

Description is required to continue. Service Code may also be required if configured as such in the service call
communication type.

For Add Comment or Cancel action, details of the original service call are displayed for informational purposes.

**Review and Submit. This panel provides an opportunity to review the information before submission.**

When the service call process is finished, the service call information is copied to a new service call communication record
and the service call communication ID is displayed on the Review and Submit panel. If there are questions linked to the
service code, the questions and answers are copied to a new response record. The response is linked to the service call
communication. The service call process is completed and service call communication takes over.

###### Service Call Communication

Service call communications are used to and process service call information gathered from interactions with the customer,
the public or other external entity. These interactions can be reporting a new issue/request, adding comments to an existing
issue/request or cancelation (issue is resolved or request no longer needed). The following service call information can be
gathered:

- **Issue/Request Details. This includes description, service category, service code, call back requirement, require by date,**
etc.

- **Location. This is the location of the service call. This can be either a known service point or a freeform address**

- **Contact. This is the contact information the interaction is with. This can be a known customer or freeform contact**
information. This is information is optional to allow anonymous interactions.

A service call communication record is created for each interaction.

- Determine if a service call information needs to be sent to the asset management system. If the service call process is
canceled or if the issue was resolved during communication, the asset management system is not notified.

- Ensure that service call information is sent out to the asset management system in the correct sequence. New service call
communication is sent out first, followed by additional comments and finally, cancelation.

- Send a service call communication outbound message to the asset management system. This is an asynchronous interface
between Oracle Utilities Customer Care and Billing and the asset management system. Because this asynchronous,
there should be no processing after the message is sent out in the same transaction. This is to avoid the case where the
transaction is rolled back due to some error, but the message is already sent to the external system. Refer to Setting Up
the System To Enable Asset Management System Integration for more details.

- Once the outbound message is sent, the service call communication will transition and stay in the Sent state until
an acknowledgement is received from the asset management system. If a positive acknowledgment is received, the
service call communication is completed. If a negative acknowledgment is received, the service call communication is
transitioned to the Error state. A service call communication in Error state can be manually canceled or re-sent.


-----

###### Service Call Communication Acknowledgement

The inbound web service C1-UpdateServiceCallCommunication is used to process a service call communication
acknowledgement message. The message contains communication ID, service call ID, service call number and error
information. This service stores this information into the service call communication. If the message indicates an error, the
service call communication is transitioned to the Error state. Otherwise, the service call communication is completed.

###### Maintaining Service Call Communications

A service call communications is used to process service call information gathered from interactions with the customer,
the public or other external entity. These interactions can be reporting a new issue/request, adding comments to an
existing issue/request or cancelation (issue is resolved or request no longer needed). Refer to Service Calls for background
information on service calls.

To view and maintain service call communications, open Menu > Field Order > Service Call Communication > Search .
You are brought to a query portal with options for searching for service call communications.

Once a service call communication record has been selected, you are brought to the maintenance portal to view and
maintain the selected record.

The following zones are displayed:

- **Service Call Communication zone shows the details of the service call .**

- **Questions zone shows the related questions and answers to the service call communication. This information is stored in**
the Response object.

Refer to the zones’ embedded help for more information.

#### Billing

In this section, we describe how to manage your customer's bills.

##### The Big Picture of Billing

A bill is used to communicate changes in an account's financial obligations to the customer. Over time, a customer receives
many bills. The topics in this section provide background information about a variety of billing topics.

**WARNING:**
Some organizations are responsible for presenting 3 rd party charges on their bills. Others are responsible for sending
their charges to a 3 rd party for presentation on their bills. If this describes your organization, refer The Big Picture of
SA Relationships for a description of how this functionality is implemented.

###### An Illustration Of A Simple Bill

The following diagram illustrates a simple bill:


-----

The following concepts are illustrated above:

**A bill is produced for an account A bill is produced for an account. Over time, an account receives many bills.**

**A bill summarizes financial transactions A bill contains information about the various financial transactions that have**
taken place since the last bill was produced (i.e., payments, adjustments, and bill corrections). The above illustration shows
a bill with financial transactions for new charges, a payment, and an adjustment.

**A bill is routed to persons A copy of the bill is sent to every person linked to the account who requires a copy of the bill.**

**A bill contains messages A bill may contain messages.**

**A bill typically contains bill segments A bill typically contains one bill segment for every active service agreement linked**
to its account.

**A bill segment contains calculation details A bill segment contains information showing how the segment was calculated**
and how it should be printed on the customer's bill.


-----

###### An Overview of the Bill Creation Process

When the system is asked to produce a bill for an account, it attempts to create one or more bill segments for every noncancelled / non-closed service agreement linked to the account. Whether or not a service agreement contributes bill
segment(s) to a bill is a complicated subject as the system supports a wide variety of bill segment creation methods. For
example, a service agreement that charges for metered service is produced as follows:

- The system first requests for the amount or usage consumed (or billing determinants) from Oracle Utilities Meter Data
Management; for example, the number of lamps, the number of gallons of water, or the peak kW. For more information,
refer to How the System Requests How Much Was Consumed.

- Next, the system applies the service agreement's rate to the amount consumed in order to calculate how much the
customer owes. A bill segment and a financial transaction are generated to reflect the results of this calculation. The
details of the calculations are captured in the bill calculation lines. For more information, refer to How Rates Affect The
Information On Bill Segments for the details. Refer to Effective Dates and Price Proration for information about how the
system prorates changes to rates and prices during a bill period.

**NOTE:**
**There are many bill segment creation algorithms. The above points explain how a bill segment is produced for a**
bill determinants required service agreement. It's important to be aware that the system has other bill segment creation
algorithms. For example, if the service agreement charges for a deposit, the system neither amalgamates consumption
nor does it apply a rate. You may be wondering how the system knows which method to use. It uses the bill segment
type on the service agreement's SA type. Refer to Designing and Defining Bill Segment Types for a description of the
various bill segment creation algorithms that are supported in the system.

If errors are detected during the bill segment creation process, the bill segment is saved with its error. The system then
proceeds to the account's next service agreement. This way, a user can see all problematic bill segments so they can be
corrected en masse. Refer to Bill Errors for information about how to deal with bill errors.

**NOTE:**
**Interdependent service agreements. Your organization may have some service agreements whose charges must be**
calculated in a specific order. For example, you might have a service agreement whose bill segments are calculated
using charges from a different bill segment. If this describes your organization, be aware that the system creates the bill
segments in the order of the billing processing sequence on each service agreement's SA type.

When every segment on a bill is error free, the bill is ready to be completed. When a bill is completed, the system:

- Creates a bill routing for each person linked to the account who requires a copy of the bill. The routing information
controls the format of the printed bill and how the bill is sent to the person. Refer to The Source Of Bill Routing
Information for the details.

- Links all bill messages to the bill. A bill message can come from a variety of sources. Refer to The Source Of Bill
Messages for the details.

- If the Freeze At Bill Completion installation option has been turned on:

  - All freezable bill segments will be frozen.

  - All freezable adjustments whose adjustment type indicates Freeze At Bill Completion will be frozen.

- Sweeps recent financial transactions that have been created since the last bill was completed. Refer to Financial
Transactions Created Between Bills for information about how payments, adjustments and bill corrections appear on a
bill.


-----

- There are several other functions that happen at completion time. Refer to the description of the Complete button under
Bill Lifecycle for the details.

And that's it; the bill can now be sent to the customer.

The remaining topics in this section provide more information about the creation and completion of bills.

**NOTE:**
**Batch and real-time bill creation. Anything the batch bill process does for whole sets of accounts, you can do to a**
specific account on-line / real time. Refer to How To Create A Bill For All Service Agreements Linked To An Account
for information about how to create a bill on-line / real time. Refer to Batch Billing for more information about the batch
bill creation process.

###### Bill Errors

The topics in this section describe errors that are detected when the system creates a bill.

###### Bill Segment Errors

If you consider the huge number of variables involved in the creation of a bill segment, it probably won't surprise you to
learn that occasionally, some bill segments are in error.

Errors tend to be caused by missing or inconsistent data. Some examples of classic errors:

- **Missing master data. For example, if a bill is supposed to be routed to the account's mailing address and the account**
doesn't have such an address, an error is generated.

- **Missing rate data. For example, if a rate contains a customer specific charge and there is no value defined on the**
customer's service agreement, an error is generated.

The system saves bill segments that are in error just as it saves bill segments that are error-free. This is done because bill
segments are nothing more than a snapshot of the data that was used to calculate the charges. By saving the snapshot, you
can see the information the system used when it detected the error and therefore more effectively fix the cause of the error.
The standard way to fix an error is to:

- Look at the bill segment to determine the cause of the error.

- Correct the cause of the error.

- Regenerate the bill segment. Regeneration simply deletes the offending segment and recreates a new segment using the
corrected information.

For every bill segment in error, a record is written to the Bill Segment Exception table.

**FASTPATH:**
Refer to How To Correct A Bill Segment That's In Error for instructions describing how to correct a bill segment.

It's obvious but worth stressing that a bill may contain some segments that are perfect and others that are in error. Once all
segments that are in error are corrected, the bill can be completed (and sent to the customer).

If the bill segment in error was created as part of the batch bill process, the system attempts to fix the offending segment(s)
each night during the account's bill window by regenerating it. Therefore, if the cause of the error is fixed during the day,
the system will automatically regenerate the bill segment when batch billing next runs; you don't have to manually correct
each bill. And once a bill is error-free, it will be completed and sent to the customer.

**FASTPATH:**


-----

Refer to Batch Billing for more information.

###### Bill Completion Errors

In addition to errors on bill segments, there may also be errors detected when the system attempts to complete a bill. For
example, if the system cannot find a mailing address, the bill will be in error (as opposed to one of its bill segments).

Errors tend to be caused by missing or inconsistent data. Some examples of classic errors:

- **Missing mailing address. For example, if the system cannot find an address to which the bill can be routed, it generates**
an error.

- **Bill segments are in error. If a bill contains bill segments that are in error, it cannot be completed and an error is**
generated.

The system saves bills that are in error just as it saves bills that are error-free. This is done because bills are nothing more
than a snapshot of the data that was used to calculate the charges. By saving the snapshot, you can see the information the
system used when it detected the error and therefore more effectively fix the cause of the error. The standard way to fix an
error is to:

- Look at the bill to determine the cause of the error.

- Correct the cause of the error.

- Recomplete the bill.

For every bill in error, a record is written to the Bill Exception table.

**FASTPATH:**
Refer to How To Correct A Bill That's In Error for more information.

If the bill completion error was created as part of the batch bill process, the system attempts to recomplete the bill each night
during the account's bill window. Therefore, if the cause of the error is fixed during the day, the system will automatically
complete the bill when batch billing next runs; you don't have to manually complete each bill.

**FASTPATH:**
Refer to Batch Billing for more information.

###### Cancel / Rebill Incorrect Bill Segments

Sometimes the error on a bill segment is not detected by the system. Such errors occur when the data used to calculate the
bill is valid, but wrong. For example, the dial reading on the meter read is incorrect due to slipped fingers, or the sales tax
percent was entered incorrectly on a bill factor.

There is no way the system can detect such problems and therefore the system freezes the bill segment and routes the bill
to the customer. To correct such a bill segment, you must cancel the offending segment and create a new segment (after
correcting the cause of the problem). We refer to this process as cancel / rebill.

**FASTPATH:**
Refer to How To Cancel / Rebill A Bill Segment for more information about how to cancel / rebill a frozen bill segment.

You must use the cancel / rebill process to correct problems on frozen bill segments. This is because a frozen bill segment
can be thought of as having been posted to your general ledger (even if the GL interface hasn't run). And once a financial


-----

transaction is posted to the general ledger, it can only be removed via a reversal. Contrast this to bill segments that are in
error - they can be deleted because they were never posted to the general ledger.

**FASTPATH:**
Refer to Bill Segment Lifecycle for more information about the differences between bill segments that are frozen and
those that are in error.

**NOTE:**
**Bill segments are canceled / rebilled. It's important to stress that bill segments are canceled and rebilled (as opposed to**
bills). If every bill segment on a bill is incorrect, you must cancel / rebill each individual bill segment.

Using the cancel or cancel/rebill functionality will cause the cancel and rebill details to be swept on to the customer's
next bill. If your organization requires cancellation details to be presented to the customer separately from the new bill,
then you will need to use Credit Notes. Refer to Credit Notes - Presenting Cancellation Details on a Separate Bill for
more information. If your organization requires cancellation and rebill details to be presented to the customer separately
from the new bill, then you will need to use Correction Notes. Refer to Correction Notes - Presenting Correction Details
on a Separate Bill for more information.

###### Credit Notes - Presenting Cancellation Details on a Separate Bill

The system's Cancel / Rebill functionality will include cancellation and rebilling details on the customer's next bill. Some
organizations are required to present cancellation details to the customer separately and not to commingle them with a new
bill. This separate statement containing only the cancellation information is referred to as a Credit Note.

Credit Notes may be created for an individual bill segment or for all the bill segments linked to a bill. To create a credit
note, a Credit Note button is available on the Bill Segment page and on the Bill page.

**FASTPATH:**
Refer to How To Create A Credit Note for more information about how to create credit notes for a bill or bill segment.

The topics in this section provide describe the impact of this functionality.

###### Credit Notes Are Only Possible if the Installation Option Is Turned On

The Credit Notes button on the bill segment and bill pages will only be available if you have selected the Credit Note Bill
Correction option on the Installation record.

###### Credit / Correction Notes and Auto Pay

If a credit or correction note is being created for a customer who is enrolled in Auto Pay, note the following functionality:

When creating a credit or correction note for a bill (and all its bill segments):

- The system will cancel an automatic payment behind-the-scenes if a credit or correction note is issued BEFORE the
automatic payment is interfaced to the financial institution. When you recomplete the bill, the system will create a new
automatic payment that reflects the new amount due (and the canceled automatic payment will net out the original
automatic payment). This is standard auto pay logic. Refer to How Are Automatic Payments Cancelled? for more
information.


-----

- If the customer has automatic payments that have already been interfaced to the financial institution, the creation of the
credit or correction note will have no affect on any automatic payment. A warning will be issued in this case.

When creating a credit or correction note for a bill segment:

- Because automatic payments are for an entire bill, creating a credit or correction note at the bill segment level will not
affect any automatic payments. A warning is issued in this case.

**FASTPATH:**
For more information about correction notes, see Correction Notes - Presenting Correction Details on a Separate Bill.

###### Adjustments On Credit Notes

Above, we described how a credit note is a separate document that contains the cancellation details of the various bill
segments that appeared on a given bill. Some implementations also want the adjustments that appeared on the original bill
to be cancelled when a credit note is produced. Then, when the next bill is produced for the customer, they want these same
adjustments reproduced. The following points describe how to implement this functionality:

- Plug in a Bill Completion algorithm on the applicable Customer Classes. A base-package algorithm (C1-CN-RADJ) will
reverse a bill's adjustments when a credit note is completed.

- Plug in a Post Bill Completion algorithm on the applicable Customer Classes. A base-package algorithm (C1-CNADNB) will recreate the adjustments on the original bill after the credit note is completed. These adjustments will be
swept onto the next bill produced for the account.

You can restrict the above functionality to specific adjustment types (for whatever reason). You do this by putting a given
char type / char value on the adjustment types that should be reversed and recreated when a credit note is created. You
define this char type / char value combination as parameters of the two algorithms described above.

**NOTE:**
**When the original bill contains adjustment cancellations. The above discussion explained how adjustments can be**
canceled on a credit note and then recreated on the next bill. These same algorithms also do the opposite, i.e., if the
original bill contains an adjustment cancellation, the credit note will contain the recreated adjustment, and the next bill
will contain its cancellation. Without this, the credit note would not be the reversal of the bill (and this is how some
organizations operate).

###### Credit Note Routing Suppression

Some implementations do not send credit notes to their customers. To implement this functionality, plug in a Bill
Completion algorithm on the applicable Customer Classes. A base-package algorithm (C1-CN-BRT) will cause the routing
information to be suppressed when a credit note is completed.

###### Correction Notes - Presenting Correction Details on a Separate Bill

The system's Cancel / Rebill functionality will include cancellation and rebilling details on the customer's next bill. Some
organizations are required to present cancellation and rebilling details to the customer separately and not to commingle
them with a new bill. This separate statement containing the cancellation and rebill information is referred to as a Correction
Note.

Correction notes may be created for an individual bill segment or for all the bill segments linked to a bill. To create a
correction note, a Correction Note button is available on the Bill Segment and Bill pages.


-----

**FASTPATH:**
Refer to How To Create A Correction Note for more information about how to create correction notes for a bill or bill
segment.

The topics in this section describe correction notes.

###### Correction Notes Are Only Possible if the Installation Option Is Turned On

The Correction Note button on the bill segment and bill pages will only be available if you have selected the Correction
Note Bill Correction option on the Installation record.

**FASTPATH:**
If your implementation uses Correction Notes, it is recommended to also use the Freeze At Bill Completion installation
option. For more information, see Installation Options - Billing.

###### Correction Notes Versus Credit Notes

Correction notes are a mixture of Credit Note and Cancel / Rebill functionality. However, unlike credit notes, correction
notes are like regular bills and are subject to payment.

When you issue a correction note for a bill, the system cancels and rebills the bill segments for that bill. The new bill (the
correction note) contains both the cancelled bill segments and the rebilled bill segments.

Similar to credit notes, the new bill (or correction note) is stamped with the ID of the original bill. After you review the bill
segments, you can complete the correction note. During completion, the rebilled bill segments and the cancelled financial
transactions (of the original bill's bill segments) are swept onto the correction note.

###### Correction Notes and Auto Pay

**FASTPATH:**
Refer to Credit / Correction Notes and Auto Pay for a description of how the system handles correction notes for
customers using auto pay.

###### How the System Requests How Much Was Consumed

There are two types of service agreements:

- Those that charge for some commodity; such as, electricity, water, garbage, and street lighting.

- Those that charge for something intangible; such as, deposit, charitable contribution, and payment arrangement.

For service agreements that charge for something intangible, there is no notion of requesting or determining how much was
consumed and therefore the topics in this section are not relevant. For service agreements that charge for a commodity, the
first step in the creation of a bill segment is requesting the amount or usage consumed (or bill determinants) from Oracle
Utilities Meter Data Management; for example,

- If the service agreement bills for electricity, the system must know how much electricity was consumed.

- If the service agreement bills for lamp service, the system must know how many lamps the customer uses.


-----

After the system requests and receives the amount or usage consumed (or bill determinants) during the bill period from
Oracle Utilities Meter Data Management, it saves the consumption or usage details on the bill segment in the following
snapshots:

- The item snapshot contains information about the items that existed at the service points received from Oracle Utilities
Meter Data Management

- The calculation/audit read details contains information about the meter read details received from Oracle Utilities
Meter Data Management

- The calculation/audit usage details contains information about the usage details received from Oracle Utilities Meter
Data Management.

- The service quantity snapshot contains the billable service quantities received from Oracle Utilities Meter Data
Management

**NOTE:** **This logic is in a plug-in. The logic described below resides in algorithms that are plugged-in on the bill**
segment type referenced on a service agreement's SA type. If you need different logic, you should develop the
appropriate algorithm and plug it in on your bill segment types.

**FASTPATH:**
Refer to The Big Picture of Usage Requests for more information about how Oracle Utilities Customer Care and Billing
requests and receives consumption / usage information from Oracle Utilities Meter Data Management.

Refer to Usage for more information about how Oracle Utilities Meter Data Management calculates usage.

###### Item Snapshot

Items (such as, lamps, hydrants, and traffic lights) are not read so there are no meter reads to access.

- There are two sources of items:

  - Item-based service points have a single, badged item that may be installed at any instant in time. These types of
service points are used, for example, when your organization keeps track of the installation history of specific lamps.
If an item is installed at an item-based service point during the bill period, it will be included in the item snapshot.

  - All types of service points (metered, item-based, and non-badged) may contain one or more unbadged items.
Multiple items exist at a service point, for example, when your organization chooses to record multiple lamps on a
single service point rather than creating a separate service point for each lamp (this might be useful for a parking lot at
a shopping mall). Each item referenced in the service point's collection of unbadged items is included in the snapshot.

**FASTPATH:**
Refer to Understanding Service Point Types for more information about service points with multiple items.

###### Service Quantity Snapshot

For service agreements where the meter reads are maintained in Oracle Utilities Meter Data Management and bill
determinants are requested via a usage request, the service quantity (SQ) snapshot is the total amount consumed (or peak
amount) for each unit of measure referenced on the bill segment's usage request.

**NOTE:**


-----

**Pre-Processing Calculation Rules. If the service agreement's rate has pre-processing calculation rules, they may alter**
the amount of measured consumption or add additional units of measure to the SQ snapshot. Refer to All Calculation
Rule-Based Rates Share a Common Structure for more information about pre-processing calculation groups.

**Lamps and estimated consumption. If any of the items linked to the service agreement's service points indicate the**
system should estimate consumption (e.g., lamps), additional entries will be added to the SQ snapshot for each such
item. Refer to Device Types for more information.

Meter read details used for interim calculations are ignored when producing the service quantity snapshot.

###### Calculation / Audit Read Details

We use the term "calculation / audit read" to describe a meter read that appears on a bill segment. The following points
provide examples of when calculation / audit reads may be required:

- Some retail companies upload meter read details when they upload pass through charges. They do this in order to print
the read details that were used to calculate the pass-through charges. It should be stressed that these reads are not used
to derive billable consumption (because the charges have already been calculated). These reads are only uploaded for
printing purposes and therefore "real" meter reads are not created. We categorize these reads as "calculation / audit
reads". Refer to Billable Charge Upload - Read Details for more information about uploading meter reads with passthrough charges.

- When usage requests are sent during billing to Oracle Utilities Meter data Management, meter reads details may be
returned to Oracle Utilities Customer Care and Billing as part of the usage request response. These reads are used for
printing purposes. These reads are captured as "calculation / audit reads". Refer to Usage Requests for more information.

- You may have situations where a meter has been temporarily removed from a service point but the business practice
dictates that usage for the service point should be calculated during billing.

Calculation / audit reads are stored in a bill segment's read details (the name of the table is CI_BSEG_ READ ). The
following points describe the main features of calculation / audit reads:

- Calculation / audit reads may or may not reference a service point.

- Calculation / audit reads do not reference the prime key of a real read.

- Calculation / audit reads have a usage flag with a value of Calculation .

- Calculation / audit reads do not require a UOM code. If a UOM is not supplied, an SQI must be supplied.

If you encounter other scenarios during your implementation that necessitate calculation / audit reads, you can develop bill
segment type and calculation rule algorithms to add additional calculation / audit reads to a bill segment's read details.

Calculation / audit read details are shown in a separate section on Bill Segment - SQ Details.

###### Calculation / Audit Usage Details

We use the term "calculation / audit usage" to describe service quantities retrieved from the bill segment's usage request. An
example of when calculation / audit usage may be required:

- When usage requests are sent during billing to Oracle Utilities Meter Data Management, usage details may be returned
to Oracle Utilities Customer Care and Billing as part of the usage request response. Oracle Utilities Meter Data
Management might return both usage details and meter reads to print on the bill.

Usage service quantities are also stored in a bill segment's read details (the name of the table is CI_BSEG_READ ). The
following points describe the main features of calculation / audit usage:

- Calculation / audit usage may or may not reference a service point.


-----

- Calculation / audit usage does not reference the prime key of a real read.

- Calculation / audit usage has a usage flag with a value of Service Quantity.

- Calculation / audit usage does not require a UOM code. If a UOM is not supplied, an SQI must be supplied.

If you encounter other scenarios during your implementation that necessitate calculation / audit usage, you can develop bill
segment type and calculation rule algorithms to add additional calculation / audit usage to a bill segment's read details.

Calculation / audit usage details are shown in a separate section on Bill Segment - SQ Details.

###### How To Override The Commodity Amount In A Bill Segment

As described earlier, the calculation of the amount consumed is one of the first steps that takes place when a bill segment is
created. 99.9% of the time, the system does a perfect job in this effort. However, there are rare circumstances when, due to
missing or incorrect data, the quantity calculated by the system is not what you want to charge the customer for (consider
what the consumption should be if the meter is broken?).

To help you deal with these rare situations, a "back door" exists that allows a bill segment's billable quantities to be
overridden. This truly is a "back door" because the proper way to fix the amount of a commodity is to correct the cause of
the error and then cancel / rebill the bill segment.

###### How Rates Affect the Information on Bill Segments

After consumption has been compiled, the system applies the service agreement's rate to the consumption to determine how
much to charge the customer. We refer to this process as the "rate application."

The rate application is a very sophisticated process and can affect every aspect of a bill segment. See Rate Schedule
Execution for an overview of how the system processes a rate.

Rates not only control which charges appear on the bill, but also the verbiage. In addition, there are variables that can be
used in the configuration to customize the message that the customer receives. See How to Use Description on Bill for more
information

**NOTE:**
**Not all service agreements use a rate! There are a small number of service agreements that don't use a rate to calculate**
the charges that appear on their bill segments. For example, a service agreement used to levy a customer's payment
arrangement amount doesn't need a rate because the amount to charge is defined on the service agreement. Whether
or not a service agreement needs a rate is defined by the service agreement's SA type. Whether or not the system calls
the service agreement's rate to calculate charges is controlled by the bill calculation algorithm plugged-in on the bill
segment type that's referenced on the service agreement's SA type. Refer to Designing and Defining Bill Segment Types
for a description of the various bill segment creation algorithms that are supported in the system.

**Proration. A rate contains a variety of effective-dated information (meaning that the prices are effective-dated, and the**
structure of the rate is effective-dated) If this effective-dated information changes during a bill period, the system may need
to prorate the charges; for example, if the sales tax percentage changes mid-period, the system can prorate the tax change.
Refer to segments. Refer to Effective Dates and Price Proration for more information.

There are many plug-in spots available on a calculation rule. These plug-ins can manipulate virtually every aspect of the
bill segment. This means if you require functionality that isn't support by the base package calculation rule, you can build
additional calculation rule plug-ins to do whatever you need. See Base Package Calculation Rule Descriptions for more
information

Refer to Rates for more information about how rates are constructed.

###### Bill Frequency - Bill Cycle vs Bill Segment Duration

An account's bill cycle defines when the system attempts to create bill segments for the account's service agreements. The
word "attempt" is stressed because a service agreement may not have a bill segment on every bill created for its account.

Some examples will help make the point:

- An account may be on a monthly bill cycle (meaning we attempt to create a bill every month for the account) but contain
only biannual service agreements. However, this is not sensible. Why? Because the system would attempt to create a bill
every month for the account's service agreements, but only twice during the year would it succeed (because the service
agreements have a biannual duration).

- An account may be on a biweekly bill cycle (meaning we attempt to create a bill every 2 weeks for the account) and
contain a mixture of biweekly, monthly, and quarterly service agreements. In this scenario, every two weeks the system
would create a bill that contains at least one bill segment (for the biweekly service agreement). However, 12 times a
year, the bill will contain an additional bill segment for the monthly service agreement. And 4 times a year, the bill will
contain one more bill segment (for a total of 3) for the quarterly service agreement.

In sum, the account's bill cycle controls when the system attempts to create a bill for the account's service agreements.
Whether a service agreement contributes a bill segment to the bill is a complicated subject. The topics in this section
describe how the system knows it's time to create a bill segment for a service agreement.

**IMPORTANT:**
An account's bill cycle should attempt to create bill segments at least as often as the shortest service agreement duration.
For example, if an account has both monthly and quarterly service agreements, the account should be placed on a
monthly bill cycle. Refer to How Does An Account Get Its Bill Cycle? for more information.

###### Ways To Control The Start Date Of A Bill Segment

Bill segments produced for a service agreement have two time periods:

- The bill segment period. The bill segment period defines the entire period of time covered by a bill segment's charges.

- The consumption period. The consumption period defines the period of time used to calculate the number of days for
daily charges.

The consumption period almost always starts one day after the bill segment period. The consumption period always ends
on the bill segment's end date. For example, a bill segment period that spans 5-Jan-2002 through 6-Feb-2002 will almost
always have a corresponding consumption period of 6-Jan-2002 through 6-Feb-2002. The reason that the start dates don't
match is because a bill segment's start date equals the end date of the prior bill segment (i.e., the start date was already
counted in the previous bill segment's consumption period and we don't want to count it twice).

The only time when the previous paragraph isn't true is the first bill segment that's produced for a new service agreement.
This is because different companies count the first day of a new service agreement differently than others. Refer to
Initial Consumption Period Considerations for examples and an explanation of how you can control the start date of the
consumption period.

###### Ways To Control The End Date Of A Bill Segment


-----

The following points describe the different methods that can be used to define the end date on a service agreement's bill
segments:

- **Meter Read Date. For service agreements with metered consumption (excluding real time meters), the end date is the**
date of the meter read used on the last day of the bill segment.

- **Bill Period Schedule. Non-metered service agreements may have the end date of their bill segments defined on the**
user-maintained bill period calendar. This option is used when bill segments must fall on strict calendar boundaries (e.g.,
quarterly bills that end on the last day of the quarter).

- **Anniversary. In addition to the Bill Period Calendar method, non-metered service agreements may have their bill**
segment end date based on the first day of service. For example, if service started on the 16 th of some month, the
ongoing bill segments will start on roughly the 16 th of each month. This option is frequently used to bill for garbage or
cable service.

- **ASAP. For non-meter service agreements that use neither the Bill Period Calendar nor Anniversary methods, the system**
assumes the end date of a bill segment is the current date. This option is frequently used for service agreements that deal
with items (e.g., street lamps, phone booths).

- **Billable Charge. For non-metered service agreements that exist to levy billable charges, the start AND end dates are**
defined on the billable charge information that is entered by a user or interfaced from an external system.

The topics in this section discuss each of the above methods.

###### Using The Meter Read Date Method

A metered service agreement's SA type does not contain a specific indication that the service agreement is used to charge
for metered service. Rather, if the system finds metered service points linked to the service agreement, it knows to use a
meter read date as the end date of the bill segment.

###### Using The Bill Period Schedule Method

The bill period schedule method causes the bill segment end date to be calculated using a bill period schedule. The bill
period's schedule defines when bill segments are produced and their respective end dates. This method is used when the bill
segment needs to fall on strict calendar boundaries (e.g., quarterly bills that end on the last day of the quarter).

The service agreement's SA type indicates if the service agreement uses this method, and if so, the specific bill period
whose schedule defines the end dates.

**NOTE:**
**Future and Past End Dates. It's important to be aware that a bill period schedule can be used to generate end dates that**
are in the future or in the past.

**FASTPATH:**
For more information about bill periods, refer to Designing Bill Periods.

###### Using The Anniversary Method

The anniversary date method causes the bill segment end date to be calculated based on the first day of service. For
example, if a service agreement started on the 16 th of some month, the ongoing bill segments will start on roughly the 16 th
of each month. This method is frequently used to bill for garbage or cable service. When using this method, you also define
the applicable billing frequency (i.e., monthly, bi-monthly, quarterly, etc.).


-----

The following table contains the bill periods for a service agreement's starting on 23-Feb-99 that uses a monthly frequency.

Start Date End Date Billing Days

24-Dec-99 24-Jan-00 31

24-Jan-00 23-Feb-00 30

23-Feb-00 25-Mar-00 31

**NOTE:**
**Future and Past End Dates. It's important to be aware that anniversary billing can generate end dates that are in**
the future or in the past. The future-option generates the next anniversary date after the current date. The past-option
generates the anniversary date that immediately precedes the current date.

The service agreement's SA type indicates if the service agreement uses this method, and if so, the billing frequency.

**FASTPATH:**
For more information about the SA Type attributes that control this method, refer to Setting Up SA Types.

###### Using Billable Charges

Bill segments for billable charge service agreements have both their start and end dates defined on the respective billable
charge.

**FASTPATH:**
For more information about billing billable charges, refer to How To Create A One-Time Invoice. For more information
about creating a billable charge, refer to Maintaining Billable Charges. For more information about interfacing a billable
charge from an external system, refer to Uploading Billable Charges.

The service agreement's SA type indicates if the service agreement uses this method, and if so, the billing frequency.

**FASTPATH:**
For more information about the SA Type attributes that control this method, refer to Setting Up SA Types.


-----

###### Preventing Short Bill Segments

Every SA type contains an attribute defining the minimum number of days on a bill segment. Whenever the system attempts
to create a bill segment other than the final bill segment, it checks if the number of days is at least as great as the minimum.
If not, the bill segment will not be created as part of this bill run. Rather, the system waits until the number of days in the
bill segment is at least as large as the minimum. This is true for all methods of bill duration calculation.

###### Prorating Charges When a Rate is Applied

It is possible for some of the prices that appear on a bill segment to change during the course of the bill period.

**FASTPATH:**
Refer to Effective Dates & Price Proration for more information about how charges are prorated during rate application.

###### Batch Billing

99.9% of all bills are created by the batch billing background process BILLING and require no human intervention before
they can be finalized and sent to a customer. The other 0.1% are created by users on-line / real time. This section discusses
several important concepts associated with batch billing. If your implementation requires processing of data by CIS
Division the BILLING background process provides an optional parameter that allows a CIS Division to be specified as an
input parameter.

This process has an optional input parameter for CIS Division. It can be used if you implementation requires processing of
data by CIS Division. You will need to create a copy of this process’s batch control for each CIS Division.

###### Window Billing And The Bill Cycle Schedule

**FASTPATH:**
Refer to The Cyclical Billing Process & Window Billing for more information about how an account's bill cycle dictates
when a customer is billed.

###### Confirming A Batch Of Bills Before Completing Them

If you're implementing new rates or if something unusual is being introduced that affects billing, you may want to turn off
the bill cycle schedule's Freeze and Complete switch. If this switch is off, the system creates bills, it just doesn't freeze and
complete them. You can then review the entire batch of bills to make sure they're clean.

- If you find the bills are wrong, correct the source of the error and rerun the bill cycle. The system will remove all
incomplete bills and then reproduce them using the corrected information in the system.

- If you find the bills are correct, turn the Freeze and Complete switch on and rerun the cycle. The system will remove all
incomplete bills and then reproduce them. Assuming nothing changed, the bill amounts will be the same.

**FASTPATH:**


-----

Refer to Setting Up Bill Cycle Schedules for more information.

###### Canceling A Batch Of Bills After They're Complete

If you need to cancel an entire batch of bills because they were created using faulty data (e.g., the wrong tax rate was
defined in the rate), you can. A background process (MASSCNCL) exists for this purpose.

This background process will cancel all the frozen bill segments for the latest run of a given bill cycle's schedule.
Optionally, you can cancel bills for a given bill date within the bill cycle's schedule. The cancel reason used on the bill
segment is the one marked as the bill cancel reason for mass cancel. Refer to Setting Up Bill (Segment) Cancellation
Reasons for more information.

When the cycle is billed again, new bill segments will be created, and the original bill segments and the cancellations will
automatically be hidden from the customers.

###### Reopening A Batch Of Bills After They're Complete

If you need to reopen an entire batch of bills because they were completed prematurely (e.g., payments did not get
posted before billing ran, so recent payments were not reflected in the account balances), you can. A background process
(MASSROBL) exists for this purpose.

This background process will reopen all the bills for a given bill date for the latest run of a given bill cycle's schedule.

###### Fixing Errors Detected In Batch Billing

If an "error" bill segment is created by the batch billing process, the system attempts to fix the offending segment each night
by regenerating it using the information that exists at that time. Therefore, if the cause of the error is fixed during the day,
the system will automatically regenerate the bill segment when batch billing next runs; you don't have to manually correct
each bill. And, once a bill is error-free, it will be completed and sent to the customer.

**IMPORTANT:**
Automatic regeneration only works during the account's bill window. If an "error" bill segment is not successfully
regenerated on the last night of the account's bill cycle, it will remain in error until the next time the account's cycle
runs (unless a user corrects it real time). At that time, the system will generate another bill error indicating the prior bill
segment is in error (and then there'll be two bill segments in error).

###### Completing Pending Bills

If you need to complete pending bills created by the batch billing process, you can. A background process (C1-BLCMP),
exists for this purpose.

This background process will complete all pending bills on a given bill date for a given bill cycle's schedule. This process
does not delete and regenerate freezable bill segments linked to pending bills.

**FASTPATH:**
Refer to Bill Errors for more information.

###### Billing Financial Transaction Considerations

The topics in this section provide information about the financial impact of a bill segment.

###### Billing - Current Balance versus Payoff Balance

A bill segment's financial transaction affects a service agreement's payoff balance and/or current balance. In this section, we
describe these two balances.

**WARNING:**
If you do not understand the difference between payoff balance and current balance, refer to Current Amount versus
Payoff Amount.

###### When Current Balance Equals Payoff Balance

For most service agreements, payoff balance and current balance are always the same (or in colloquial speech - the amount
the customer thinks they owe equals what they really owe). Let's run through a typical example. The values in the payoff
balance and current balance columns reflect the amount due after the financial transaction has been applied (i.e., the running
balance):

Date Financial Transaction Payoff Balance Current Balance

1-Jan-99 Bill: $125 125 125

15-Jan-99 Payment: $150 -25 -25

2-Feb-99 Bill: $175 150 150

14-Feb-99 Payment: $150 0 0

3-Mar-99 Bill: $200 200 200

15-Mar-99 Payment: $150 50 50

2-Apr-99 Bill: $225 275 275

As you can see, payoff balance and current balance are always in sync.

###### When Current Balance Differs From Payoff Balance

For some service agreements, payoff balance and current balance differ (or in colloquial speech - the amount the customer
thinks they owe differs from what they would owe if they wanted to pay off their account).

Let's run through an example of a customer on a budget to illustrate a classic service agreement where these two balances
are not the same. The values in the payoff balance and current balance columns reflect the amount due after the financial
transaction has been applied:

Date Financial Transaction Payoff Balance Current Balance

1-Jan-99 Bill: $125, Budget $150 125 150

15-Jan-99 Payment: $150 -25 0


-----

2-Feb-99 Bill: $175, Budget $150 150 150

14-Feb-99 Payment: $150 0 0

3-Mar-99 Bill: $200, Budget $150 200 150

15-Mar-99 Payment: $150 50 0

The following table describes the various types of service agreements where these balances may differ.

Type Of Service Agreement What Payoff Balance Holds What Current Balance Holds


Deposit Payoff balance holds the amount of deposit

you are holding on behalf of the customer's

debt. This amount is showed as a credit (with

a negative sign) because you truly owe the

customer this money.

Charitable contribution N/A - charitable contribution service

agreements never have a payoff balance.

Payment arrangements Payoff balance holds the total amount of

delinquent debt that remains unpaid. When a

payment arrangement is started, you transfer

the payoff balance from the utility service

agreement to the payment arrangement

service agreement. Each billing period, the

customer pays down this balance.

Service agreements on a budget plan Payoff balance holds the actual amount owed

(actual bills minus payments).


Current balance holds the amount the

customer owes for a deposit.

Current balance holds the amount the

customer owes for a charitable contribution.

Current balance holds the amount the

customer owes in respect of the billed

payment arrangement amounts.

Current balance holds the amount the

customer owes in respect of the billed budget

amount.


###### Bill Segment Type Controls Which Balance(s) Are Affected

Every bill segment references a bill segment type (the bill segment type comes from its service agreement's SA type). The
bill segment type controls how payoff balance and current balance are affected by the bill segment amount. It also controls
the algorithm used by the system to calculate the bill segment's bill lines.

**FASTPATH:**
Refer to Designing and Defining Bill Segment Types for more information about how bill segment type affects how a
bill segment is produced and how its financial transaction is generated.

###### The Source Of GL Accounts On A Bill Segment's Financial Transaction

A bill segment's financial transaction also contains the double-sided accounting entry that defines how the bill segment
affects the general ledger.

**FASTPATH:**
Refer to The Source Of GL Accounts On Financial Transactions for a description of where the system extracts the
distribution codes used to construct the GL accounts.


-----

###### Determining the Statistical Quantity

The statistical quantity for each general entry line in the financial transaction is populated by adding together the statistical
quantity for all bill calculation lines for the same distribution code. The bill calculation line indicates a statistical quantity if
its corresponding calculation rule has marked the GL statistical quantity setting.

The statistical quantity for a bill calculation line is the prorated billable quantity for that line.

- If the corresponding calculation rule for the bill calculation line is not marked measures peak, then the statistical
quantity corresponds to the billable quantity for the bill line. This is because billable quantities for SQs that do not
represent a peak quantity are prorated when applying the rate.

- If the corresponding calculation rule for the bill calculation line is marked measures peak, then the statistical quantity
may not correspond to the billable quantity for the bill calculation line. SQs that measure peak are not prorated when
applying the rate. However, when determining the statistical amount to send to the general ledger, the quantity is
prorated in the same manner as quantities that do not measure peak amounts.

**NOTE:**
**Bill Calc Line Statistical Quantity. The statistical quantity for each bill calculation line is calculated when generating**
the bill segment and used to populate the statistical quantity for the FT GL entry. The calculated value is not saved in the
bill calc line record.

###### The Source Of Bill Routing Information

When a bill is completed, the system creates a bill routing for each person linked to the account who receives a copy of the
bill. The bill routing record contains the information that controls how, where and to whom a bill is sent.

The following points describe how this works:

- Each person who receives a copy of an account's bill is listed on the account's person information.

- A bill routing is created for each such person when the bill is completed.

- The information that appears on the bill routing record is controlled by the bill route type specified on the respective
account / person information.

- If the bill route type’s routing method is email or fax and the system has been configured to use notification preferences
for bill routing, a bill routing is created for each active contact preference whose notification type is associated with the
**bill route type specified on the respective account/person information ; otherwise, bill routings are created as follows:**

  - If the bill route type indicates the person's bills are routed via fax, the "address line 1" address constituent is populated
with the person's fax number. The system knows which of a person’s person contacts is a fax number is by the contact
routing or which of a person's phone numbers is a fax number by the phone type.. If person contacts are used, the
primary fax is selected. If phone is used and the person has multiple fax numbers, one is selected at random.

  - If the bill route type indicates the person's bills are routed via email, the "address line 1" address constituent is
populated with the person's Email address. The system knows which of a person’s person contacts is an email or
knows where to find the person email. If person contacts are used, the primary email is selected.

- If the bill route type indicates the person's bills are routed via the postal service, the address constituents are populated
with the address specified on the account / person'sbill address source. Note, if the person has a seasonal address
effective on the business date, the seasonal address will be used regardless of the value of bill address source.

Refer to Printing Bills and How To Reprint A Bill (For The Original Recipients or For Someone New) for more
information. Refer to Account - Person Information for information regarding how to control who receives a copy of a
bill, where the bill is sent, and how the bill is formatted.

###### Bill Messages

The topics in this section describe how messages are linked to a bill and bill segment.

###### The Source Of Bill Messages

When a bill is completed, the system sweeps bill messages from the following sources onto the bill.

**NOTE:**
**Bill or Bill Segment Messages. Bill messages will be linked either to the bill or to one its bill segments depending on**
the source of the bill message code. In other words, messages associated with a service agreement (directly or indirectly)
will be linked to the bill segment; messages associated with an account (directly or indirectly) will be linked to the bill.

- All permanent and temporary bill messages linked to an account are linked to the bill when it is completed. Refer to
Account - Bill Messages for more information. Note well that all temporary bill messages are removed from the account
when they are swept onto a bill (a temporary message is swept onto the next bill produced for the account).

- The system checks if the bill's account's customer class has bill messages. If so, it links all such messages that are
effective on the bill date to the bill when it is completed. Refer to Setting Up Customer Class Bill Messages.

- All permanent and temporary bill messages linked to service agreements that contributed bill segments to the bill are
linked to their respective bill segment when the bill is completed. Refer to Service Agreement - Miscellaneous for more
information. Note well that all temporary bill messages are removed from the service agreement when they are swept
onto a bill segment (a temporary message is swept onto the next bill segment produced for the service agreement).

- The system checks if each bill segment's rate has bill messages. If so, it links all such messages that are effective on the
bill segment's start date to the bill segment when the bill is completed. Refer to Defining Calculation Rules for more
information.

- The system checks if the service provider associated with each sub bill segment has bill messages. If so, it links all such
messages that are effective on the bill segment's start date to the bill segment when the bill is completed. Refer to Setting
Up Service Providers.

In addition, a user may manually add an ad hoc message to a bill.

And finally, you can develop your own background processes and algorithms that add bill messages to accounts, service
agreements, bills and/or bill segments. Refer to Substituting Field Values Into A Bill Message for examples.

###### Substituting Field Values Into A Message

Many bill messages contain static text (i.e., the message is the same on every bill). However, the system supports messages
whose contents are dynamic. For example, consider the bill message Thank you for your charitable contributions in 2000
for $123.12, please keep this bill for tax purposes. This message contains two substitution values (the year and the amount)
as is therefore considered dynamic.

Dynamic messages can be implemented as follows:


-----

- Create a bill message code whose Message on Bill contains substitution values. For example, the bill message code to
produce the message illustrated above would contain the following Message on Bill - Thank you for your charitable
contributions in %1 for %2, please keep this bill for tax purposes.

- Use either of the following methods to link the message code and its substitution parameters to the bill:

  - Create a background process or algorithm to insert a permanent or temporary bill message on the appropriate
accounts. Then, when an account's bill is next completed, the system will sweep the message (and its substitution
parameters onto the bill).
In addition to inserting the appropriate bill message code, your background process / algorithm must also insert the
appropriate substitution values. The name of the table in which account messages are inserted is CI_ACCT_MSG.
The name of the table in which a message's substitution values are inserted is CI_ACCT_MSG_PRM (you will
insert one row for each substitution field).

Please see the background process (REACH) for an example of a background process that performs this type of
function. Please see the algorithm identified by DEP PIF MSG for an example of an algorithm that performs this type
of function.

  - Rather than adding the dynamic message to account (and then letting the bill completion logic transfer the account
message to the bill), you could construct a bill completion algorithm that adds the message code and substitution
values on the bill (during bill completion). The name of the table in which bill messages are inserted is CI_BILL_
**MSGS. The name of the table in which a message's substitution values are substituted is CI_BILL_MSG_PRM (you**
will insert one row for each substitution field).

###### A Bill May Affect More Than Just Customer Balances

The topics in this section provide information about obscure things that may happen when a bill is created, frozen, or
canceled.

###### Auto Cancel / Rebill If A Service Agreement Is Stopped Retroactively

If the system detects a bill segment with a bill date after the stop date of the service agreement (because the service
agreement was retroactively stopped), the system automatically cancels the bill segment and creates a new one with an end
date equal to the service agreement's stop date.

###### Cancel Historical, Estimated Bill Segments When a Real Read Is Found

A special plug-in spot exists on bill segment type that can be used to automatically cancel historical, estimated bill segments
when a “real” read is used on the current bill. This plug-in spot is invoked only when an excessive read (the prior read is
more than the current read) situation is detected.

If you wish that the spot be invoked all the time and not only when an excessive read situation is encountered, you must
setup the Always Call Auto Cancel option type of the Financial Transaction Options Feature Configuration. You will
normally do this if you want the type of readings to be the basis of the auto cancellation. For example, you want to cancel
estimated bills and rebill distributing usage more accurately across a tiered rate.

These algorithm would typically be specified on bill segment types that calculate bills using meter reads.

**NOTE:**
This plug-in spot is typically used on bill segment types that calculate bills using meter reads. It is typically not used
when usage is requested from Oracle Utilities Meter Data Management.


-----

This algorithm is called by the system when creating bills in batch. It does not get called when a user creates a bill
online.

###### Deposits May Be Refunded

**FASTPATH:**
Refer to Refunding Deposits for how deposits may be refunded when a deposit service agreement is "final billed".

###### FT Freeze Repercussions

**FASTPATH:**
Refer to Obscure Things That Can Happen for more information about things that can happen when an FT is frozen
(and FT's get frozen during billing).

###### Budget Billing

The topics in this section provide background information about a variety of budget billing issues.

**FASTPATH:**
We strongly recommend familiarizing yourself with the topics described in Designing and Defining Budget Plans to
fully appreciate how budgets fit into the system's financial architecture.

###### Account versus Service Agreement

Customers who pay on a budget plan tend to believe that there is one budget amount applied to their account's bill each
month. This is not true. Rather, each service agreement has an individual budget amount (stored in the recurring charge
array). The sum of an account's service agreements' budget amount is the account's budget amount.

Why does each service agreement have a unique budget amount? Because all financial accounting in the system is
performed at the service agreement level, not for an entire account.

While a unique budget amount is defined for each service agreement, a user can use a simple page to view and change the
budget amount for all eligible service agreements linked to an account.

It's important to be aware that some service agreements linked to an account may not be eligible for budget plans. For
example, assume you have a customer with a deposit service agreement and one or more utility service agreements. This
customer will be billed for their deposit regardless of the utility service agreements' budget amounts. You define whether a
service agreement may participate in a budget plan on the service agreement's SA type.

###### How To Set Up A Customer To Participate In A Budget Plan

If a customer wants to participate in a budget billing plan, simply transfer to Account - Budget and generate a new budget
for the customer.


-----

###### The Financial Impact Of Budget Plans

The only difference between a customer who participates in budget billing and one who doesn't is that budget billing
customer have bill segments where payoff amount differs from current amount. Why? Because the payoff amount is the
actual amount of the bill. The current amount is the amount the customer is expected to pay (i.e., their budget amount).

Let's run through an example of a customer on a budget to illustrate a service agreement where these two balances are
not the same. The values in the payoff balance and current balance columns reflect the amount due after the financial
transaction has been applied:

Date Financial Transaction Payoff Balance Current Balance

1-Jan-99 Bill: $125, Budget $150 125 150

15-Jan-99 Payment: $150 -25 0

2-Feb-99 Bill: $175, Budget $150 150 150

14-Feb-99 Payment: $150 0 0

3-Mar-99 Bill: $200, Budget $150 200 150

15-Mar-99 Payment: $150 50 0

**FASTPATH:**
For more information about current and payoff amounts, refer to Current Balance versus Payoff Balance.

###### Budget Billing Background Processes

The topics in this section describe the background processes that automate management of customer who participate in
budget billing plans.

**NOTE:**
**Budget Processing. The budget background processes only calculate budget amounts for pending start, active and**
pending stop SAs whose start and end date (if any) includes the budget date. Additionally, the budget date is used to
select the rate schedule that is in effect for an SA if estimating consumption is necessary.

###### Budget True Up

The Budget True Up background process (BUDTRUP) examines all accounts who participate in budget billing plans. If
enough time has passed since the customer's budget was last trued up, the system will calculate the account's recommended
budget amount. If the recommended amount differs from their existing budget amount by more than a given tolerance
percentage, the customer's budget amount (actually, the recurring charge amount on the account's service agreements) will
be changed.

**FASTPATH:**
The amount of time between true ups and the true up method used to true up is defined on the account's budget plan. The
tolerance percentages are defined as parameters of the true-up algorithm that is plugged in on the account's budget plan.
Refer to Designing and Defining Budget Plans for all the details.


-----

###### Budget Monitor

The Budget Monitor background process (BUDMON) examines all accounts that participate in budget billing plans. If
the account's existing budget amount is out-of-sync with predefined tolerance percentages as defined by the algorithm
plugged into the monitor budget plug-in spot, the system will perform the action indicated by the monitor algorithm. The
base product supports highlighting the account on the Budget Review page or updating the account’s budget.

**FASTPATH:**
The tolerance percentages are defined as parameters of the budget monitor algorithm that is plugged in on the account's
budget plan. Refer to Designing and Defining Budget Plans for all the details.

###### Canceling A Budget

The following points describe when a budget is cancelled:

- A user can cancel a budget at any time by using the Cancel Budget action on the Account - Budget page.

- The system may cancel a budget during a collection process (if the collection process contains a Cancel Budget
collection event). Refer to Types Of Collection Events for more information.

- When a service agreement is stopped, the system automatically cancels the budget.

When a customer's budget is cancelled, the following events transpire:

- Any recurring charge entry whose effective date is after the cancel date is deleted. This is possible if you are entering a
back-dated stop date for the service agreement. For example, perhaps you run the Budget True Up process, which adds a
new budget amount to the service agreement (effective today). Then imagine that the customer calls you and informs you
that they moved out last week. If you stop the customer's service as of last week, the recurring charge effective today is
deleted when the stop is finalized.

- A new recurring charge amount of zero is created for each of the customer's service agreement.

- Each service agreement's current balance is synchronized with its payoff balance (using the sync adjustment code
defined on the service agreement's SA type).

###### Net Energy Metering

The topics in this section provide background information on net energy metering.

###### What Is Net Energy Metering?

Customers in a distributed generation energy market may have renewable energy devices such as solar panels or wind
turbines connected to their meters. The energy generated at this service point, as well as any energy used, could possibly
be measured by a single meter, with the energy generated being netted against the energy used. This is called net energy
metering (NEM). The meter records a positive number when customers use more energy than they generate, and a negative
number when they generate more than they consume. These customers may owe a minimum charge each month. Their
actual energy charges and generation credits are accrued until the account is adjusted at the end of a specified period,
called the true up period. When the account is trued up, the consumption charges and generation credits for the period are
combined to determine if the customer owes money to the utility.


-----

###### Net Energy Metering Service Agreements

As mentioned in the previous section, net energy metering (NEM) customers typically owe a minimum charge each month
while their actual energy charges and generation credits are accrued until true up time. This is accomplished by setting up
a master service agreement (SA) to hold the monthly minimum charge and a sub service agreement to hold the customer’s
actual energy charges and generation credits.

For more information about service agreement relationships, refer to Defining SA Relationship Options.

###### Net Energy Metering True Up

To facilitate the true up process, each true up period will be represented by a sub service agreement. Each sub service
agreement will be monitored by a true up monitor (TUM), a service task which is responsible for: performing the true up
process at the end of the true up period; reversing true up transactions when cancel/rebills affect a period that has been
trued up; synchronizing itself with any changes on its master service agreement or service agreement relationship (e.g.,
if the service agreement relationship is deleted, the true up monitor will cancel itself); and creating the service agreement
relationship and sub service agreement for the next true up period.

A service agreement creation algorithm on the master service agreement type is responsible for creating the initial sub
service agreement and service agreement relationship. Subsequent sub service agreements are created in the true up monitor
lifecycle. A service agreement creation algorithm on the sub service agreement type is responsible for creating the true up
monitor. A link to the true up monitor service task is available from the characteristics page of the sub service agreement. It
is important to note that the true up monitor is not a user-maintained object. End-users will not normally need to access the
true up monitor. All that is visible on the true up monitor is its type, status, related sub service agreement and account. As
always, relevant financial history will be accessible from the sub service agreement.

###### The Lifecycle of a True Up Monitor

The following diagram shows the lifecycle of the True Up Monitor business object:

**Active State: The true up monitor starts out in the Active state. Here the true up monitor is evaluated for true up processing**
or possible cancellation. The system will perform a true up if either the true up period has come to an end, or the service
agreement is final billed.

The amount of time between true ups is defined on the true up task type. See Setting Up the System for Net Energy
Metering for a description of how true up task types are configured.

**Canceled State: The true up monitor is transitioned to the Canceled state if its service agreement is canceled or deleted.**
Because the service agreement associated with a true up monitor is a sub service agreement, it is possible that the stop date
on the sub service agreement is backdated to a point prior to the start of its associated service agreement relationship. In this
case, the true up monitor is also canceled.


-----

**Trued Up State: If it is time for true up, the true up monitor is transitioned to the Trued Up state. True up processing**
involves summing the sub service agreement’s bill segments to see if the customer owes any debt (i.e., the energy they
generated was not enough to cover the energy they consumed). If the sum is positive, the amount is transferred to the master
service agreement for the customer to pay off. If the sum is negative, the sub service agreement balance is brought to zero
(the utility keeps the credit). If your implementation wants to issue refunds to customers who generate more energy than
they consume, you will need to design your own algorithm for the true up process.

The adjustment types used to transfer or zero out the sub service agreement balance are defined on the true up monitor type.
See Setting Up the System for Net Energy Metering for a description of how true up monitor types are configured.

**Reverse True Up State: Once the financial true up is done, a new service agreement relationship and sub service**
agreement are created for the subsequent true up period. If cancel/rebillls occur after the true up process has been
performed, the true up monitor is transitioned to the Reverse True Up state. Any adjustments that were previously created
are canceled as part of this processing. Thereafter the true up monitor is transitioned back to the Active state, where it waits
until bill completion attempts another true up.

###### Setting Up the System for Net Energy Metering

This section summarizes the various tasks required for setting up your system for net energy metering.

**Adjustment Types**
The following adjustment types are used at true up time:

- **Current Balance True Up. This is the adjustment type used in syncing the payoff and current amounts on the sub**
service agreement associated with the true up period. This adjustment type should reference an FT algorithm of Payoff
**Amount = 0 / Current Amount = Adj Amount (no GL).**

- **Transfer To Master. This is the adjustment type used to transfer the customer’s balance from sub service agreement to**
master service agreement if a positive payoff balance exists on the sub service agreement after true up.

- **Write Down. This is the adjustment type used to bring the payoff balance of the sub service agreement to zero if a**
negative payoff balance exists after true up.

**Adjustment Type Profile**
Create an adjustment type profile that references the adjustment types used in net energy metering billing.

**True Up Task Type**
To enable billing for net energy metering, your implementation must configure a True Up Task Type. This service task
type captures the various configuration options that are used by the true up monitor’s algorithms:

- **Minimum Days In True Up Period defines the minimum number of days covered by the bill segments within a true up**
period before true up processing can occur

- The task type captures the adjustment types used at true up time

- **Reversal Adjustment Cancel Reason is used on true up adjustments that are canceled as a result of cancel/rebill activity**
occurring after a true up

**Algorithms**
Add the following algorithms:

- The sub service agreement and service agreement relationship are initially created by an SA Creation algorithm on the
master service agreement type. The base package provides algorithm type C1-SAT-SARL for this purpose. An algorithm
should be configured with the service agreement relationship type to use.


-----

- Creation of the true up monitor is handled by an SA Creation algorithm on the sub service agreement type. The base
provides algorithm type C1-SAT-TUM for this purpose. The true up monitor service task type is defined as an algorithm
parameter.

- Whenever a net energy metering sub service agreement is canceled, its associated true up monitor should also be
canceled. The base provides algorithm C1-CNC-TUM to be plugged in as an SA Cancel algorithm on the sub service
agreement type to accomplish this.

- The true up monitor is transitioned out of the Active or Reverse True Up state by the billing process. To that end, a
**Bill Completion algorithm needs to be configured on the master service agreement type. This algorithm is responsible**
for transitioning any true up monitor that is in an Active or Reverse True Up state that is related to the master service
agreement. The base provides the algorithm C1-TRN-TUM for this purpose.

- When cancel/rebills occur, financial transactions related to the true up need to be reversed. To accomplish this, an FT
**Freeze algorithm must be plugged in on the sub service agreement type. The base provides algorithm C1-RV-TRUP for**
this purpose.

For more information on setting up service agreement Relationships, refer to Defining SA Relationship Options. For more
information on service agreement type algorithms, refer to SA Type - Algorithms.

Your implementation must also decide if the sub service agreement’s bill segment financial transactions should impact the
general ledger or not. This is controlled by the Financial Algorithm on the bill segment type defined for the sub service
agreement type. The base provides algorithms C1-C0-GL and C1-C0-NOGL for this purpose. For more information on
configuring Bill Segment Types, refer to Designing and Defining Bill Segment Types.

###### Net Energy Metering Billing Examples

This section contains billing examples for net energy metering. The examples assume the following:

- The customer is billed quarterly using the following tariff:

  - Customer charge of $3/day (billed on master service agreement)

  - $0.10 per kWh (billed on sub service agreement and trued up after 12 month period)

- The GL Accounting distribution codes used in the following tables, such as A/R-NEM and NEM-Liability, are for
example only. Your implementation will specify its own distribution codes.

- A True Up Task Type that references the base product NEM business objects with the following configuration:

  - **Minimum Days In True Up Period: 365**

  - **Sync Current Adjustment Type: NEM SYNC**
This is the adjustment type used to synchronize (make equal) the sub service agreement’s current amount with the
payoff amount at true up time.

  - **Transfer Adjustment Type: NEM XFER**
This is the adjustment type used to transfer debt from the sub service agreement to the master service agreement at
true up time.

  - **Write Down Adjustment Type: NEM WDWN**
This is the adjustment type used to write down any remaining amount on the sub service agreement after we attempt
to transfer debt to the master service agreement at true up time.

**Example 1: Customer Consumes More Than They Generate**
The following table outlines the customer’s master service agreement financial transactions in 2010. Adjustments created in
the true up period are in bold. In this example the customer’s net energy results in an outstanding balance of $330 which is
transferred from the sub service agreement to the master service agreement, leaving the sub service agreement for that true
up period with a zero balance.

###### Using Billable Charges for Pass Through / Convergent Billing

The term "pass through" billing is used to describe the practice of receiving charges calculated by third parties and
presenting them on the customer's bill along with your own charges. "Pass through" billing is implemented in the system
using Billable Charges.

The following points provide information to help you decide the most appropriate way to implement "pass through" billing
given your specific requirements:

- Customers with pass through charges will need a separate service agreement to hold the pass through charges. We refer
to this type of service agreement as a "billable charge" service agreement.

**NOTE:**
A service agreement's SA type controls whether a service agreement can have billable charges linked to it. Specifically,
the SA type must have a "special role" of Billable Charge.

- A billable charge service agreement holds the billable charges until the customer is next billed. At that time, a separate
bill segment will be created for each unbilled billable charge linked to the billable charge service agreement.

- While it is not required, we recommend creating a separate billable charge service agreement for each type of pass
through charge. For example, if you can receive "pass through" charges from the local water company and the local cable
company, we'd recommend having two billable charge service agreements for each customer.

- As described under We Bill For Them, you can setup the system to automatically create billable charge service
agreements when you start regular service for your customers. If you take this approach, you can also have the system
create the payable transaction to pay the 3rd party. Refer to Pay At Bill Time vs. Pay At Pay Time for more information.

- You can interface billable charges using the Billable Charge Interface. The interfaced charges can consist of any of the
following:

- Pre-calculated bill lines that will be presented "as is" to the customer.

- Service quantities that are used by the system to calculate the charges on behalf of the third party. For example, the
3rd party may pass through the number of kilowatt-hours and you calculate the bill lines for them. Refer to Uploading
Consumption Rather Than Bill Lines for more information.


-----

- Meter read details that you want printed on the bill. Note, the base package bill segment creation algorithm (BSBSBC) simply sweeps billable charge read details onto the related bill segment's read detail. This algorithm does NOT use
these reads to derive service quantities. This is intentional as most implementations that import reads also import service
quantities and therefore deriving service quantities is unnecessary (and also error prone). If your implementation needs to
derive service quantities from these reads, you can develop your own bill segment creation algorithm to do just this.

- All of the above. You might interface both bill lines and service quantities if the third party calculated the charges but did
not calculate the taxes. The dollar amount for which taxes will be calculated would be defined using a service quantity.
Refer to Calculating Taxes On Uploaded Charges for more information.

**NOTE:**
You cannot interface interval data via the billable charge interface. Rather, you would need to interface the interval data
to Oracle Utilities Meter Data Management and then let the system calculate the charges for you.

- The bill lines on a billable charge can fit into any of the following categories:

- Memo-only (i.e., don't affect the general ledger). A bill line that is memo-only contain information that is purely
informational. For example, the 3rd party might pass the start and end meter reads that they used to calculate the charges.
You can use memo-only bill lines to show this information on the customer's bill. If a bill line is not memo-only (i.e., it
affect the general ledger), a distribution code must also be specified to define how the lines affects the general ledger.

- Show on the customer bill. It is possible to create bill lines that affect the general ledger, but are not shown on the
customer's bill. This is an unusual practice, but it happens.

- Summary / detail. Each bill line has an indication of whether it is a summary or detail line. This only impacts bill
presentation.

**NOTE:**
The above indicators can be defaulted onto a billable charge line by using Billable Charge Line Types when you
interface the lines into the system.

- Characteristics (i.e., user-defined fields) can be associated with billable charge lines. You might populate this
information if you are interfaced information that may be useful during bill presentation or for reporting purposes.

- If service quantities are specified on a billable charge, they are saved on the bill segment created when the billable
charge is billed. This means that they system can support creation of a graph of historical usage on the bill, as well as
other queries on customer usage. In addition, it might be possible to event estimate consumption based on these service
quantities (but such a plug-in is not supplied with the base package).

**NOTE:**
The system does not support passing in items (e.g., street lamps). This could be a problem if you need to perform ratable
calculations for the 3rd party based on, say, the number of street lights. However, if you require ratable, street light pass
through billing, you can calculate a service quantity for each type of street light and save this information on the billable
charge. The associated rate would then have a price per service quantity rather than a price per item type.

The system does not support sending in raw meter reads with billable charges. This consumption needs to be passed in
as a service quantity. However, you can pass in meter read details to be printed on the bill segment.

- Cancel / rebill for billable charges is quite different than for normal bill segments. A billable charge bill segment can be
cancelled, and this will reverse the financial effects of the billable charge. But without new information from the source,
there is no way to rebill the customer. Therefore, if the original charges were incorrect, the source system would send
both a reversal of the charges and a newly revised set of information. These could be passed as two separate billable
charges or they could combined on a single billable charge.

- In terms of the customer information setup, while a service agreement that holds billable charges does not need a service
point, there are advantages to having this information in the system. For one thing, if jurisdictional taxes are being
calculated by the system, the definition of the jurisdiction(s) is held on the service point or premise. Also, the link to the


-----

service point defines the service address, facilitates customer lookup, causes information to appear in Control Central's
trees, etc.

- For most other functionality, the billable charge service agreement supports the same functionality as normal service
agreements. This includes budget billing, payment distribution, credit & collection tracking and events, current & payoff
balances, movement of old debt onto payment arrangements, etc.

**FASTPATH:**
For more information about billing billable charges, refer to How To Create A One-Time Invoice. For more
information about creating a billable charge, refer to Maintaining Billable Charges. For more information about
creating sub service agreements to hold billable charges, refer to We Bill For Them. For more information about
interfacing a billable charge from an external system, refer to Uploading Billable Charges.

###### Printing Bills

The contents of this section describe the technical implementation of both an online and batch bill production.

###### Bill Routings Are Created For Each Recipient Of A Bill

Refer to The Source Of Bill Routing Information for a description of how the system constructs the information used to
route a bill to one or more recipients.

###### Bill Route Types Control The Information Merged Onto Bills

Every bill routing record references a Bill Route Type.

The bill route type controls the following for interacting with a document composition application:

**NOTE:** CIS Division can override the extract algorithm and/or the background process found on the bill route type. The
system processes first check the bill’s account’s CIS Division for an override specific for the bill route type.

- It contains an algorithm that is responsible for extracting the information merged onto your bills. Algorithms of this type
are called under the following scenarios:

  - Thebackground process that interacts with your bill print software calls these algorithms.

  - If your bill print software has the ability to construct a real-time image of a bill, you can plug-in an Online Bill
Display algorithm on the Installation Record. This type of algorithm will call the bill extract algorithm for an
appropriate bill route type to extract the information that is merged onto the bill. Refer to Technical Implementation
Of Online Bill Display for the details.

- It contains the ID of the background process responsible for interacting with your bill print software in batch.

The bill route type controls the following for interacting with a reporting engine, such as BI Publisher:

- It contains an algorithm that is responsible for returning the appropriate report code and other information in order to
extract the information to be merged onto your bills. Typically, the reporting engine itself is responsible for extracting
and formatting the data. Algorithms of this type are called under the following scenarios:

  - The background process that interacts with your reporting engine calls these algorithms.

  - If your reporting engine has the ability to construct a real-time image of a bill, you can plug-in an Online Bill Display
algorithm on the Installation Record. This type of algorithm will call the bill extract algorithm for an appropriate bill


-----

route type to return the appropriate report code. Refer to Technical Implementation Of Online Bill Display for the
details.

- It contains the ID of the background process responsible for interacting with your reporting engine in batch.

###### Technical Implementation Of Online Bill Display

Users can view an image of any bill that is sent to a customer on Bill - Main if you plug-in an Online Bill Display
construction algorithm on the Installation Record

**NOTE:** Some display algorithms rely on the bill extract algorithm on each Bill Route Type

The system can make a call to an external system to retrieve a bill image. Many bill print vendors support this functionality.

The system provides an Installation – Online Bill Display algorithm type (C1GENBILLURL) that can generate a dynamic
URL.

- The algorithm of this algorithm type supports dynamic variables such as the bill ID and static variable such a vendor or
implementation supplied security key.

- The algorithm constructs a URL including generating HASH or security keys.

- The system displays the retrieved image in a separate browser session

- Refer to the algorithm type description for information about this algorithm type.

The system can interact with either document composition applications, or a reporting engine (such as BI Publisher).

The system provides an Installation – Online Bill Display algorithm type (C1-BL-DISP) that interacts with Documaker to
render an online image of your bill. The following points describe what takes place when clicking Display Bill.

- The algorithm based on this algorithm type calls the bill extract algorithm for an appropriate bill route type (as
determined by the algorithm).

- The bill extract algorithm will construct the information that appears on the bill (refer to algorithm type C1-BLEX-XML
for further details).

- The constructed information is passed to document composition software that will reconstruct the bill’s image in a PDF
format.

- The system displays the PDF in a separate browser session. Note that the client must have Adobe Acrobat Reader
installed to view PDF files.

**NOTE:**
Refer to The Bill Extract Records for examples of the record layouts passed to the document composition software.

The system also provides an Installation – Online Bill Display algorithm type (C1-ONLN-CR) that interacts with BI
Publisher to render an online image of your bill. The following points describe what takes place when clicking Display Bill:

- The algorithm based on this algorithm type calls the bill extract algorithm for an appropriate bill route type (as
determined by the algorithm).

- The bill extract algorithm returns the appropriate report code to the Online Bill Display algorithm, which in turn returns
the report code to the bill page (refer to algorithm type C1-BLEX-BIP for further details). This algorithm is not actually
extracting data because when you use BI Publisher reports, the report itself is responsible for extracting and formatting
the data.

- A user exit on the bill page invokes BI Publisher and displays the bill in a separate browser session.

**NOTE:**


-----

Refer to Bill Print in BI Publisher for examples of the data extracted for the report.

###### Technical Implementation Of Printing Bills In Batch

The batch process that extracts bill related information reads all bill routing records in a given run number that are marked
with its batch control ID

The base package example of this process (POSTROUT) simply calls the bill extract algorithm on the routing record's route
type. The algorithm formats the information to be passed to the bill print software or reporting engine. Refer to Bill Route
Types Control The Information On Bills for more information.

**NOTE:**
**If your software doesn't support online bill display. The algorithm that formats bill extract records that's plugged in**
onbill route type serves two purposes: 1) it interacts with the online bill display algorithm plugged into the installation
record to support online images of a bill, and 2) it interacts with the background process to support printing your bills
in batch. If your bill print software does not support the rendering of bill images real time, there is no need to create
an extract algorithm. Rather, you should simply develop your own download process that works with your bill print
software to print bills in batch (and then specify this batch process on your bill route type).

###### Reproducing The Bill Print Flat File

You can reproduce the flat file at any time. Simply request the download process and specify the run number associated
with the historic run.

###### How To Reprint A Specific Bill

Refer to How To Reprint A Bill (For The Original Recipients or For Someone New) for instructions describing how to
reprint a specific bill.

###### Who Gets A Copy Of A Bill?

A copy of a bill is sent to every individual / business specified in the bill's routing details.

There are two ways in which a bill routing detail can be created:

- When a bill is completed, the system creates a routing detail for every person linked to the account that wants to receive
a copy of the bill (as specified on Account - Person Information). Refer to The Source Of Bill Routing Information for
more information.

- After a bill is completed, you may insert a bill routing record. Refer to How To Reprint A Bill (For The Original
Recipients or For Someone New) for more information.

###### Final Bills and Bill Print


-----

If a bill is produced for an account where all of the accounts SAs are stopped, closed or cancelled; the bill is flagged as
being the final bill on the flat file produced by the postal routing process (refer to Bill Record - 0100 for the details of this
switch).

If a bill is considered to be a final bill and the amount owing for the entire account is less than the final bill threshold
amount on the installation record, the bill will be skipped (i.e., it won't appear on the flat file produced by the postal routing
process). Note, this logic also suppresses bills from being produced when a payment is received AFTER the final bill and
the account's balance falls beneath the installation record's final bill threshold amount. Refer to Installation Options - Billing
for more information.

###### The Bill Extract Records

Numerous different types of records are interfaced to the document composition application. However, they all share a
common structure for bills:

- The first 4 bytes are called the Printer Key. This field is a record type used by the document composition application bill
template.

- The next 244 bytes are called the Sort Key. This field is used to ensure the various records used to construct a printed
bill appear in the correct order in the interface file.

- The next 12 bytes are called the Mailing Key. This field is used to control the order in which the formatted bills are
printed.

- The next 3 bytes are a filler that is available for future use.

- The remaining bytes contain the BillInformation that appears on the printed bill. The type of information differs for
each type of record.

The topics in this section describe each component.

###### XML Bill Extracts

The system includes a sample bill extract algorithm that produces an XML document to interface to a document
composition application. This is an alternative to the fixed flat file format described above. For additional details, see the
algorithm type Create XML bill extract records (C1-BLEX-XML).

Algorithms of this type construct the XML file records that contain the information that appears on a printed bill. Each
record in the extract is constructed using an extendable data area and may be extended by an implementation using the Post
Processing Script parameter. The following steps should be followed to include additional elements in the extract:

- Create a data area that includes the additional elements for the record you wish to extend. This data area must reference
the base product data area used in the extract. For example, to extend the bill record, create a data area that references
data area C1-BillPrintBillRecord as its extended data area. See the C1-BLEX-XML algorithm type for a complete list of
the data areas available.

- Create a service script to retrieve the additional elements. This service script must be defined as the Post Processing
Script on your algorithm and its schema must include the main bill extract data area (C1-BillPrintRecord).

For an example of how to extend the XML bill extract to include additional elements, see the CI_BillPrintXMLExtract
export bundle included in the demo data.

###### Sequential Bill Numbers

Every bill is uniquely identified by its bill ID. Bill ID is a random, system-assigned number. In some locales, bills have an
additional identifier known as a "sequential bill number". Sequential bill numbers are system-assigned, sequential numbers.


-----

For example, the first bill produced by the system is assigned a sequential bill number of 1, the next bill is assigned a value
of 2, etc. An additional requirement is that no gaps may exist between the sequential bill numbers.

The topics in this section describe how sequential bill numbers are implemented in the system.

###### Sequential Numbers Are Only Assigned If The Installation Option Is Turned On

Sequential bill numbers will only be assigned if you have selected Sequential Bill Numbers as the Alternative Bill ID
Option on the Installation record.

###### Pending Bills Do Not Have A Sequential Bill Number

Bills are assigned a sequential bill number after they are completed. This means that pending bills will not have a sequential
bill number. This is intentional as pending bills can be deleted and if a deleted bill had a sequential bill number, gaps would
result. Refer to Bill Lifecycle for more information about a bill's state transition lifecycle.

###### When / How Is The Sequential Bill Number Assigned

**WARNING:**
This section is a technical explanation of how sequential bill numbers are assigned. It contains background information
for those who wish to understand the rationale of the design.

The batch billing background process BILLING takes advantage of parallel processing to allow multiple bills to be
produced concurrently. In addition, we allow groups of bills to be committed in "chunks" (based on the commit frequency
assigned to the billing background process). These two facts make it impossible to allocate sequential bill numbers during
batch billing (because back outs could result in gaps and parallel processing could result in duplicates). This is why
sequential bill numbers are allocated as follows:

- A sequential bill number is allocated when a bill is completed online (by clicking the Complete button on Bill - Main).

- If you submit the batch billing process with the following parameters, sequential bill numbers will be allocated when
bills are completed:

- **Batch thread number must equal 1.**

- **Batch thread count must equal 1.**

- **Override maximum records between commits must equal 1.**
The above parameters mean that bills are not being produced in parallel and they are not being committed in "chunks".
This allows the system to allocate sequential bill numbers when the bills are completed.

- If you do not run batch billing single-threaded, you must schedule the Assign Sequential Bill Numbers background
process (ASSGNSBN) to run immediately after batch billing. This single-threaded process assigns sequential bill
numbers to completed bills.

- The following measures are in place as a fail-safe:

- If the bill print download background process (POSTROUT) encounters a bill without a sequential bill number, it will
abort with an appropriate error message.


-----

- Users are not allowed to delete a completed bill with a sequential bill number. Note, deletion of completed bills is
typically prohibited due to the presence of frozen bill segments. However, it's possible to create a bill without frozen bill
segments and additional logic exist to inhibit the deletion of such bills if they have sequential bill numbers.

###### Additional Functionality for Sequential Bill Numbering

The following points describe additional features that are enabled when the Installation record indicates sequential bill
numbers are used:

- The bill's number appears in "bill info". "Bill info" is the concatenated string of information that summarizes a bill on
many pages in the system.

- The Bill Search page includes an additional search option to search by bill number.

- The match type algorithm (DSO BILL-ID) that allows payments to be matched to a given bill id will try to match the
payment to a bill with a matching sequential bill number.

###### Document Numbers

Every bill is uniquely identified by its bill ID. Bill ID is a random, system-assigned number. In some locales utilities may be
required to assign and print an additional document number. For example, in Argentina a utility must obtain authorization
from the national tax agency before they are allowed to print bills at a local office. Once authorized, the utility is assigned
a printing authorization code valid for a period. The printing authorization code and expiration, as well as an official
document number are printed on the bill at the location where the bill is issued.

The topics in this section describe how document numbers are implemented in the system.

###### Document Numbers Are Only Assigned If the Installation Option Is Turned On

Document numbers will only be assigned if you have selected Document Numbers as the Alternative Bill ID Option on the
Installation record. In addition, the Document Number (C1–DOC-NBR) and Document Number Details (C1–DOCNBRDT) algorithms must be enabled on the Installation record. These algorithms contain the logic used by the system to assign a
document number to a bill.

The logic used to assign a document number can be quite complex. For example, the document number may depend on the
issuing center, the bill’s document type (credit memo, invoice or debit memo), the account’s VAT category and the CIS
division. Depending on your implementations complexity, you may choose one of the following possible configurations for
document numbers:

- Populate the Document Number, Document Number Details and Document Sequence Number algorithms on the
Installation record. The system will behave as follows:

  - During online bill completion, a document type is derived and captured on the bill along with other required bill
characteristics and a document number is assigned

  - During batch billing, a document type is derived and captured on the bill along with other required bill characteristics.
Assigning a document number is deferred to the Assign Bill Document Numbers background process. The idea here is
that all complex logic is executed during the multi-threaded batch billing process leaving the minimal amount of work
for the single-threaded batch process that assigns the document number.

- Populate the Document Number and Document Number Details algorithms on the Installation record. Here, the system
assigns a document number during online bill completion, but skips the assignment of document type and number


-----

during batch billing. The Assign Bill Document Numbers background process is responsible for deriving the bill’s
characteristics (document type, document classification, etc.) and assigning a document number.

###### Pending Bills Do Not Have a Document Number

Similar to sequential bill numbers, bills are assigned a document number after they are completed. This means that pending
bills will not have a document number. Refer to Bill Lifecycle for more information about a bill's state transition lifecycle.

###### When/How Is the Document Number Assigned

**WARNING:**
This section is a technical explanation of how document numbers are assigned. It contains background information for
those who wish to understand the rationale of the design.

- An installation algorithm assigns a document number to a bill.

Similar to sequential bill numbers, document numbers are allocated as follows:

- A document number is allocated when a bill is completed online (by clicking the Complete button on Bill - Main).

- The Assign Bill Document Numbers background process (C1-BNBAS) should be scheduled to run immediately after
batch billing. This single-threaded process assigns document numbers to completed bills.

- The logic used to assign a document number resides in the installation options Document Number (C1–DOC-NBR)
algorithm.

- The following measures are in place as a fail-safe:

- If the billing download process (POSTROUT) encounters a bill without a document number, it will abort with an
appropriate error message.

- Users are not allowed to delete a completed bill with a document number. Note, deletion of completed bills is typically
prohibited due to the presence of frozen bill segments. However, it's possible to create a bill without frozen bill segments
and additional logic exist to inhibit the deletion of such bills if they have sequential bill numbers.

###### Additional Functionality Exists When Document Numbers Are Used

The following points describe additional features that are enabled when the Installation record indicates that document
numbers are used:

- The Bill Search page includes an additional search option to search by Document Number and Document Type.

- The bill's document number and type appear in "bill info". "Bill info" is the concatenated string of information that
summarizes a bill on many pages in the system.

- The match type algorithm (C1–PDOV-PYBN) that allows payments to be matched to a given bill id will try to match the
payment to a bill with a matching document number and type.

###### Digital Signatures

In some locales, billing software is required to generate and store digital signatures for each bill. Digital signatures are used
to secure bills that are stored in the database, and the digital key for the bill will be known only to the vendor.


-----

CCB supports digital signatures with the following features:

- An Encryption feature configuration must be configured with an algorithm info option for the key alias and signing
algorithm

- The installation algorithm, C1-BILLSIG, generates the digital signature for a bill and captures this on the bill itself. The
algorithm also stores an alias of the private/public key pair on the Bill as a characteristic. See the installation algorithm,
C1-BILLSIG, for a description of how the signature is generated.

- Bills are assigned a digital signature when they are completed.

  - The Assign Bill Document Numbers background process (C1-BNBAS) is responsible for generating digital signatures
for a batch of bills. This batch job should be scheduled to run immediately after batch billing. See the description of
the batch control and parameter settings for generating digital signatures.

  - A digital signature is also generated when a bill is completed online (by clicking the Complete button)

**NOTE:** The digital signatures features are only appropriate for customers who use document number in generating bill
signatures.

For an example of the objects and instructions used for implementing this feature, see the CI_BilllDocNumber &
DigitalSignature export bundle included in the demo data.

For details about setting up the required keystore for this feature, see the Installation Guide.

###### Writing Off Bills

If your organization practices open-item accounting and your credit and collections rules revolve around collecting on
unpaid bills, you can set up the system to automatically write-off bills.

If you've enabled this functionality, Bill - Main will contain a button that a user can click to manually write off a bill. A
corresponding button exists that a user can click to reverse a written-off bill.

**FASTPATH:**
Refer to Writing Off Bills for a description of how to set up the system to allow both automated and manual bill write
off.

###### Idiosyncratic Manual Bill Cancellation

If a bill's account is associated with a Customer Class that has a Cancel Bill algorithm, the system invokes this algorithm
before the bill is displayed to determine if the bill is "cancellable". If the algorithm indicates the bill is cancellable, a button
appears on Bill - Main. When clicked, the Cancel Bill algorithm is invoked again to cancel the bill. This functionality
is meant to support unique cancellation needs required by some implementations; the sample base-package algorithm is
empty.

##### Maintaining Bills

A bill is used to communicate changes in a customer's financial obligations to the customer. The topics in this section
describe how to maintain bills.

**NOTE:**


-----

**The system creates most bills behind-the-scenes. Most bills are created by the system when it processes the bill cycle**
schedule. You should only have to access the bill pages to correct a bill or to add a bill real-time. For information about
how the system creates bills, refer to The Big Picture of Billing.

It's important to be aware that there are very few fields that are directly modifiable by a user. To modify most fields on
a bill, you have to change source information (e.g., service agreement, rate, meter read) and then regenerate the bill. For
example, if you want to change a bill's amount, you must cancel or add bill segments; you cannot change the bill's amount
by modifying the bill amount field. Refer to How To for step-by-step instructions that explain how to perform common bill
maintenance functions.

###### Bill Lifecycle

The following diagram shows the possible lifecycle of a bill.

**WARNING:**
This explanation only makes sense in the context of the page used to maintain bills. Refer to Bill - Main Information for
the details.

A bill is initially saved in the Pending state. You may create one or more bill segments for the account's service agreements
at this point. Refer to How To for information about generating bill segments for the bill.

A bill becomes Complete when it is ready to be sent to the customer. Completing a bill triggers many things to occur. Refer
to the section below for information about what happens when a bill is completed.

When you complete a bill, several things may happen:

- Pre-completion algorithms associated with the account's service agreements' SA types are executed. The system executes
these algorithms first in the order of the billing processing sequence on each service agreement's SA type then in the
order of the algorithm's sequence. These are not executed for the completion of credit notes.

- Pre-completion algorithms associated with the account's customer class are executed.

- The bill's due date is calculated. This is equal to the bill date plus the number of days defined on the account's customer
class. If the resultant date is not a workday, the due date is set to the next workday. Note, this due date can be overridden
if an override algorithm exists on the account's customer class.

- The bill's routing information is set up using Account - Person Information.

- If the Freeze At Bill Completion installation option has been turned on, freezable bill segments and adjustments linked
to the account are frozen. Note, only freezable adjustments whose adjustment type indicates Freeze At Bill Completion


-----

will be frozen at this time. Refer to Preventing SA Balances And The GL From Being Impacted Until Bill Completion
for more information.

- If a final bill segment of a deposit service agreement is detected, the deposit is refunded to the customer using the refund
method algorithm plugged-in on the deposit SA's deposit class. Refer to Deposit Refund for more information. This step
is skipped during the completion of credit notes, or if the bill is linked to an off cycle bill generator.

- Bill completion algorithms associated with the account's service agreements' SA types are executed. The system executes
these algorithms first in the order of the billing processing sequence on each service agreement's SA type then in the
order of the algorithm's sequence.

- Bill completion algorithms associated with the account's customer class are executed.

- Bill messages are amalgamated from various sources and linked to the bill. Refer to The Source Of Bill Messages for
more information.

- Other financial transactions that have been frozen since the last bill and are marked to show on bill are linked to the new
bill

- For open-item customers adjustments and corrections are linked

- For correction notes or credit notes, the bill cancellation financial transactions are linked

- For off cycle bill generator bills:

- Adjustments linked to the off cycle bill generator are linked to the bill

- If the off cycle bill generator is linked to a service agreement, then all non-payment financial transactions associated with
the SA are linked to the bill

- For all other situations, payments, adjustments and corrections are linked assuming the adjustments are not linked to an
off cycle bill generator

- All financial transactions that don't already have a user-defined aging date will be dated with the current date. In other
words, they start aging from the date the bill is completed.

- If the account pays automatically and the installation's Autopay Creation Option is to Create At Bill Completion, an
automatic payment is created. Refer to APAY-CREATE for more information about the auto pay creation algorithm.
This step is skipped during the completion of credit notes.

- If the account's customer class indicates the account is an open-item customer, a match event is created. The bill's FTs
and the automatic payment's FTs are linked to it. Refer to Payments and Match Events for more information about match
events. This step is skipped during the completion of credit notes.

- If the account pays automatically and the installation's Autopay Creation Option is to Create On Extract Date, the bill
is stamped with the date when the automatic payment is to be created. Refer to APAYCRET, the background process
that creates the automatic payment, and APAYDSFR, the background process that distributes and freezes the automatic
payment, for more information. This step is skipped during the completion of credit notes.

- The bill's late payment date is calculated. This is equal to the due date plus the grace days defined on the account's
customer class. If the resultant date is not a workday, the LPC date is set to the next workday. This step is skipped during
the completion of credit notes.

- The account is marked for review by the account debt monitor on its due date plus a grace period defined on its customer
class. This step is skipped during the completion of credit notes.

- If the account's customer class indicates the account is an open-item customer, the system will create a match event if the
new charges are offset by other financial transactions. Refer to Payments and Match Events for more information about
match events. This step is skipped during the completion of credit notes.

- The bill's status becomes Complete.

- Post bill completion algorithms associated with the account's customer class are executed.

If the system cannot complete the bill (for whatever reason), the bill remains Pending and an error message is shown on the
main bill page. After correcting the cause of the problem, attempt to complete the bill again.


-----

A complete bill may be changed back to pending using the Reopen button on Bill - Main Information. You would reopen a
bill when

- Add more bill segments to a completed bill. Refer to the How To section for information about linking bill segments for
a bill.

- Fine-tune the payments, adjustments, and corrections that were linked to a completed bill. Refer to the How To section
for detailed instructions.

When you're happy with the bill, you can complete it again.

**NOTE:**
**Cannot reopen historical bills. You may only reopen an account's most recent bill (except if this bill is linked to an**
off cycle bill generator) because recompleting the bill causes the ending-balance to change, and we don't want this to
happen to historical bills.

**Automatic payments. If an automatic payment was created when the bill was completed and it has already been**
interfaced to the financial institution, you cannot reopen the bill. If the automatic payment exists, but it has not yet been
interfaced, the system will automatically cancel the payment when you reopen the bill.

**Certain bill completion algorithms prevent reopening. If a bill contains a service agreement whose SA type has a**
"transfer accounts receivable to service provider" algorithm, the system will not allow the bill to be reopened. Refer
to If You Deal With TBFU Service Providers You Can't Reopen Bills for more information about this bill completion
algorithm.

You may delete a Pending bill from the database. You may not delete a pending bill if: a) there are frozen bill segments
linked to the bill, or b) if financial transactions were linked to the bill (and this can only happen if the bill had been
previously completed).

In addition to removing the bill, the system will also remove unfrozen bill segments linked to the bill.

###### Bill - Main Information

Open Menu > Financial > Bill > Search to maintain core bill information.

The following discussion describes the fields on this page. Refer to How To for a description of how to perform common
bill maintenance functions.

**Description of Page**

**Bill Info contains a concatenation of important information about the bill (e.g., the bill date, its status, due date, ending**
balance, etc.). If sequential bill numbering has been enabled, the bill's number also appears. If document numbering has
been enabled, the assigned document number and document type will also appear. If this bill is a correction note or credit
note, a message will appear indicating this along with the ID of the original bill. If the batch billing background process
generates the bill, the bill information includes the bill cycle and window start date. Bills generated manually, i.e., offschedule, do not have this information.

**Bill ID is the system-assigned unique identifier of the bill.**

**Account ID identifies the customer who is responsible for the bill. The name of the main customer on the account appears**
adjacent.

If this bill is a credit note or correction note, a message appears adjacent to the account information indicating that this
bill is a credit note or correction note for another bill; this hyperlink will drill you to the original bill. If a credit note or
correction note has been issued for one or more of this bill's bill segments, a message appears indicating such. Bill Status
is the bill's status. Refer to Bill Lifecycle for the potential values and how to handle a bill when it exists in a given state.
Adjacent to the bill status is the Display Bill button, which will display an online image of the bill when clicked. Refer to
How To Display A Bill On-line for more information.


-----

If the bill is associated with an off cycle bill generator, a message appears adjacent to the bill status indicating this and the
hyperlink will take the user to the related off cycle bill generator.

**NOTE:**
You can only use the Display Bill button if your system has been configured to display an on-line image; otherwise, a
message indicating that the service is not available will appear. This option can only be configured by your technical
staff. The system comes with configurations to display bill images using a document composition application such as BI
_Publisher or to retrieve a bill image from an external source such as a bill print vendor. This feature can also work with_
other applications.

**Due Date is the date on which the bill is due. A bill's due date is calculated as follows:**

- Add the due days specified on the account's customer class to the bill date.

- The resulting date is the due date unless it's not a workday. In this case, the due date is set to the next workday (workdays
are defined in the installation options tables).

- If the account's customer class has an override due date calculation algorithm, the due date may be overridden. Refer to
Setting Up Customer Classes for more information.

**NOTE:**
**Late payment charges. Late payment charges are calculated on the due date plus the grace period. Refer to Defining**
Late Payment Charge Options for more information.

**Bill Date is the business date that was used when the bill was completed. For example, if batch billing starts on 11:55 pm on**
1-Jan-2000 and a bill is produced at 1:00 am on 2-Jan-2000, this bill's bill date would be 1-Jan-2000.

**Create Date/Time is the date and time on which the bill was originally created.**

**Completion Date/Time is the date and time on which the bill was completed.**

If the customer pays automatically and the automatic payment has not yet been created, a brief message appears
highlighting the date and amount of the future automatic payment. In addition, a button appears called Stop Autopay,
that, when clicked, causes the associated automatic payment to stop. You might click this button if the customer indicates
that they will send in a payment. After you click the Stop Autopay button, a message appears highlighting the stoppage.
Refer to How And When Are Automatic Payments Created for more information about how to setup the system to defer the
creation of automatic payments until the future automatic payment extract date.

In the Message area, a brief error message appears if there's a problem with the bill. The message area is suppressed if there
are no problems with the bill.

Click the magnifying button to view the long explanation. The long explanation will provide information about the cause of
the error (and how to fix it).

The Late Payment Charge Details section contains information about how the system determines when and whether to
levy late payment charges:

- **Eligible for Late Payment Charge can be checked if a charge should be levied for late payment. This field is defaulted**
based on the customer's customer class. If you want to excuse a bill from late payment charge processing uncheck this
box.

- **Late Payment Charge Date is the date on which the system will levy a late payment charge if payment is not received.**
This date is calculated when the bill is completed. It is equal to the bill's due date plus the account's customer class's
grace days. If this date does not fall on a workday, the date is set to the next available workday when the bill is
completed. If you want to manually delay the onset of late payment charge processing, extend this date into the future.

**FASTPATH:**


-----

**Late payment charges. Late payment charges are calculated on the due date plus the grace period. Refer to How Late**
Payment Charges Get Calculated for more information.

**Bill Summary summarizes the financial impact of the bill. The information that appears differs depending on whether the**
account is a balance-forward or open-item account. If the account is a balance-forward customer, the following information
appears:

- **Previous Period's Balance is the balance from the account's last bill.**

- **Total Payments is the total amount of frozen or canceled payment segment financial transactions linked to this bill.**
Frozen payment segments appear as negative numbers (decreasing the amount owed by the customer), while canceled
payment segments appear as positive numbers (increasing the amount owed). You can drill down on this balance to view
the financial transactions that contribute to this total. Refer to How To Remove Unwanted Payments From A Completed
Bill for a description of how to perform common maintenance functions.

- **Total Adjustments is the total amount of frozen or canceled adjustment financial transactions linked to this bill. You**
can drill down on the balance to view the financial transactions that contribute to this total. Refer to How To Remove
Unwanted Adjustments From A Completed Bill for a description of how to perform common maintenance functions.

- **Total Bill Corrections is the total amount of canceled and / or rebilled bill segment financial transactions linked to this**
bill. You can drill down on the balance to view the financial transactions that contribute to this total.

- **Total Current Billing Charges is the total amount of frozen bill segment financial transactions linked to this bill. You**
can drill down on the balance to view the financial transactions that contribute to this total.

- **Ending Balance For This Period is the sum of the five amounts above. It is the amount owed by the customer as of the**
end of the bill period.

If the account is an open-item customer, the following information appears under Bill Summary:

- **New Charges is the total amount of frozen bill segment financial transactions linked to this bill. You can drill down on**
this value to view the financial transactions that contribute to this total.

- **Adjustments is the total amount of frozen or canceled adjustment financial transactions linked to this bill. You can drill**
down on this value to view the financial transactions that contribute to this total. Refer to How To Remove Unwanted
Adjustments From A Completed Bill for a description of how to perform common maintenance functions.

- **Corrections is the total amount of canceled and / or rebilled bill segment financial transactions linked to this bill. You**
can drill down on this value to view the financial transactions that contribute to this total.

- **Total is the sum of the above amounts. You can drill down on this value to view the financial transactions that contribute**
to this total.

If the account is an open-item customer, the following information appears under Match Summary (note, this section is not
displayed for balance-forward accounts):

- X Balanced Item(s) contains the count and total amount of financial transactions linked to this bill that are linked to
balanced match events.

- X Unbalanced Item(s) contains the count and total amount of financial transactions linked to this bill that are linked to
unbalanced match events.

- X Disputed Item(s) contains the count and total amount of financial transactions linked to this bill that are linked to
disputed match events.

- X Unmatched Item(s) contains the count and total amount of financial transactions linked to this bill that are not linked
to any match event.

**Total Changes After Completion only appears if bill segments that appeared on the original bill have been subsequently**
canceled or rebilled. The amount displayed is the net effect of all cancels and rebills. Note, you can use the Remarks
column in the bill segments grid (to the right) to see which bill segments have been cancelled / rebilled.

If 25 or fewer bill segments are linked to this bill, the grid in the lower right portion of the page contains one row for every
bill segment linked to the bill.


-----

The following points describe each column in the grid:

- The Bill Segment column contains a concatenation of each bill segment's division, SA type, status and bill period. The
division and SA type come from the bill segment's service agreement.

- The Current Amount column contains the bill segment's effect on the service agreement's current balance.

- The Status column shows the bill segment's status. Refer to Bill Segment Lifecycle for the possible values.

- The Remarks highlight special situations. The following remarks may appear:

- Rebill after completion appears if the bill segment is a rebill that was created after the bill was sent to the customer. The
financial impact of this bill segment appears as a "bill correction" on the next bill produced for the customer.

- Rebill prior completion appears if the bill segment is a rebill that was created before the bill was sent to the customer.

- Canceled after completion appears if the bill segment was canceled after the bill was sent to the customer. The financial
impact of this bill segment appears as a "bill correction" on the next bill produced for the customer.

- Canceled prior completion appears if the bill segment was canceled before the bill was sent to the customer.

- If the bill segment's status is Error or Incomplete, this column contains an estimated value of this bill segment. The
estimated value is calculated by computing an average daily amount from the service agreement's frozen bill segments in
the last 365 days. This average is then applied to the number of days in this bill segment's bill period. If the bill segment
doesn't have a bill period (rare, but possible), the historical average is not displayed.

- If the bill segment's status is Error, this column also contains the error message.

- Rebilled due to correction appears if a correction note was generated for the bill segment. This remark appears only if
you have the Correction Note Billing Option specified in the Installation record.

- Rebilled due to correction. Canceled after completion appears for a correction note that spawns another correction note.
This remark appears only if you have the Correction Note Billing Option specified in the Installation record.

If more than 25 bill segments are linked to this bill, the grid in the lower right portion of the page contains a summary of the
various bill segments linked to the bill.

The following points describe each column in the grid:

- The Status column shows the bill segment's status. Refer to Bill Segment Lifecycle for the possible values. Click on the
hyperlink to transfer to the Bill Segments tab where the associated bill segments can be viewed.

- The Total Bill Segments column contains the number of bill segments linked to the bill with this Status. If the status is
Error or Incomplete, this column contains an estimated value of these bill segments. The estimated value is calculated
by computing an average daily amount from frozen bill segments in the last 365 days for each service agreement. This
average is then applied to the number of days in each bill segment's bill period. Please note, an historical average cannot
be computed if an Error or Incomplete bill segment does not have a bill period (rare, but possible).

- The Total Amount column contains the sum of the current amount of these bill segments.

At the bottom of the scroll is shown the Total Generated Charge. This represents the total amount of the bill segments.
This amount may differ from the Total Current Billing Charges when:

- The bill is not Complete. A bill segment's financial effect is not shown on the bill until the bill is completed.

- A bill segment has been canceled / rebilled since the bill was completed.

The topics that follow describe each of the actions that appear in the Bill SegmentAction and Bill Action areas. Refer to
How To for a description of typical business processes that use these buttons.

###### Generate

The Generate button causes a bill segment to be created for each service agreement linked to the account. The system
generates bill segments in the order of the billing processing sequence on each service agreement's SA type.


-----

This button is enabled when you are in add mode (i.e., you are not displaying an existing bill) and you have selected an
**Account ID.**

When clicked, the Generate window opens.

You must specify the following parameters in the Generate window to generate the bill segments:

- **Cutoff Date is the last possible day of each bill segments bill period. The current date defaults when the window opens.**
Refer to Ways To Control The End Date Of A Bill Segment for more information.

- **Accounting Date defines the financial period to which the new bill segments' financial transactions are booked. The**
current date defaults when the window opens.

- Check Allow Estimatesindicates if Oracle Utilities Meter Data Management should estimate consumption if it cannot
find a meter read.

- If the service agreements use meter reads, use the Billing Option to control how the system retrieves meter reads that
appear on the bill. Choose Use Cut off Date if the meter reads must exist on the Cutoff Date (defined above). Choose
Use Schedule if you want the service agreement's service point(s) measurement cycle schedule to control the meter reads
that are used.

After specifying the parameters, click Calculate to create a new bill and new bill segments for the account. You see a
summary of the bill segments in the lower right portion of the page.

###### Freeze

Clicking Freeze causes all freezable bill segments to become frozen. Refer to Bill Segment Lifecycle for more information
about freezing.

This button is enabled if:

- the Freeze At Will Bill Segment Freeze Option on the installation option has been selected AND

- freezable bill segments exist AND

- there are no error, incomplete or pending cancel bill segments.

**NOTE:**
**Freezing a day or more after generation. If, during freezing, bill segments in closed accounting periods are detected,**
a pop-up appears in which you can specify a new accounting date; this date is updated onto the offending bill segments.
This only happens if the accounting period closes before you freeze the bill segments (the accounting date is stamped on
a bill segment when it's generated).

If, after freezing, you're ready to send the bill to the customer click Complete to finalize the bill.

**NOTE:**
**If problems are detected after freezing. A bill segment may not be changed after it is frozen. All subsequent changes**
must occur by canceling the frozen bill segment and creating a new bill segment. Refer to How To Cancel A Bill
Segment and How To Cancel / Rebill A Bill Segment for more information.

###### Cancel Frozen

Clicking Cancel Frozen causes all frozen bill segments to become canceled. Refer to Bill Segment Lifecycle for more
information about cancellation. This button is disabled if the bill is written off.

**NOTE:**


-----

**Pending cancels are not affected. Clicking Cancel Frozen does not affect bill segments that are pending cancel. To**
make a pending cancel bill segment canceled, transfer to Bill Segment - Main and click Cancel.

If you need to cancel a specific bill segment, either transfer to the next tab and cancel the bill segment in question or follow
the instructions under How To Cancel A Bill Segment.

This button is enabled if frozen bill segments are linked to the bill.

When clicked, the Cancel Frozen Bill Segments window opens.

In the Cancel Frozen Bill Segments window, you must specify the following parameters to cancel the frozen bill segments:

- **Cancel Reason defines why you are performing the cancellation.**

- **Accounting Date defines the financial period to which the canceled bill segments' financial transactions are booked. The**
current date defaults when the window opens.

After specifying the parameters, click Calculate to cancel the frozen bill segments.

**NOTE:**
**There is no Undo. Unlike cancellations performed on Bill Segment - Main, there is no Undo action. This transaction**
moves the pending cancel bill segments to the cancel state immediately; whereas the bill segment transaction lets you
examine the cancellation before you commit it. If you cancelled bill segments by mistake, you must generate and freeze
new bill segments.

If the bill is pending, the cancellation causes the bill segments to be suppressed on the version of the bill sent to the
customer (but they remain in the database for audit and financial reporting purposes).

If the bill is complete and you do not Reopen the bill, the financial impact of the canceled bill segments appears on the next
bill created for the account (under Bill Corrections).

If the bill is complete you may be able to Reopen the bill and then Complete it. By doing this, you can suppress a frozen bill
segment on a previously completed bill. This means that if you catch a problem after completion you don't necessarily have
to show the problem to the customer. Rather, cancel the problem, reopen and then recomplete the bill (when you recomplete
the bill the system marks the bill segment to be suppressed on the version sent to the customer because its cancellation
appears on the same bill as the original charges).

###### Freeze / Complete

The Freeze / Complete button performs a variety of functions:

- all freezable bill segments (including rebills) become frozen

- all pending cancel bill segments become canceled

- all freezable adjustments whose adjustment type indicates Freeze At Bill Completion become frozen

- the bill is finalized and marked for transmission to the customer

Refer to Bill Lifecycle for information about what happens during bill completion. Refer to Bill Segment Lifecycle for more
information about freezing.

This button is enabled if:

- the Freeze At Bill Completion Bill Segment Freeze Option on the installation option has been selected AND

- the bill is pending AND

- there are no bill segments or there are bill segments and all are freezable, pending cancel, frozen or canceled AND

- there are no error or incomplete bill segments.


-----

When clicked, the Complete window opens.

If the User May Override Bill Date option has been enabled on the Installation Record, you may override the Bill Date
prior to completion. Otherwise, the Bill Date is the current date and cannot be changed. The current date defaults when the
window opens.

**NOTE:**
**Freezing a day or more after generation. If, during freezing, bill segments in closed accounting periods are detected,**
a pop-up appears in which you can specify a new accounting date; this date is updated onto the offending bill segments.
This will only happen if the accounting period closes before you freeze the bill segments (the accounting date is stamped
on a bill segment when it's initially generated).

After specifying the parameter, click Calculate to freeze and complete the bill.

###### Complete

The Complete button causes a bill to be finalized and marked for transmission to the customer. Refer to Bill Lifecycle for
information about what happens during bill completion.

This button is enabled if:

- the Freeze At Will Bill Segment Freeze Option on the installation option has been selected AND

- the bill is pending AND

- there are no bill segments or there are bill segments and all are frozen or canceled.

When clicked, the Complete window opens.

If the User May Override Bill Date option has been enabled on the Installation Record, you may override the Bill Date
prior to completion. Otherwise, the Bill Date is the current date and cannot be changed. The current date defaults when the
window opens. If completing a correction note, the user is prompted to enter a Correction Note Date instead of a bill date
in the Complete window.

After specifying the above parameters, click Calculate to complete the bill.

###### Delete

The Delete button deletes a bill and its bill segments.

This button is enabled if:

- the bill is pending AND

- all bill segments are incomplete, freezable or in error.

###### Reopen

The Reopen button causes a bill to be reopened. Refer to Bill Lifecycle for information about why you would reopen a bill.

This button is enabled if:

- the bill is complete AND

- the bill is not written off AND

- this is the most recent bill produced for the account AND


-----

- the bill is not linked to an off cycle bill generator AND

- reopening hasn't been prohibited for the bill. Refer to Bill Lifecycle for information about conditions that can prevent a
bill from reopening.

After reopening a bill, it returns to the pending state and you can make changes to the account's financial transactions (e.g.,
add payments, adjustments, and bill segments). After which, you click Complete or Freeze / Complete to finalize the bill.
Only one of these buttons is shown - the specific one depends on how your organization has set the Bill Segment Freeze
**Option on the installation record.**

###### Credit Note

The Credit Note button is used to cancel ALL bill segments and create a new bill that contains the cancellation details. We
refer to this "negative bill" as a credit note. Refer to Credit Notes - Presenting Cancellation Details on a Separate Bill for
more information.

This button is enabled if:

- the Use Credit Notes option on the Installation record is turned on AND

- the bill is not written off AND

- The bill has frozen bill segments.

To create credit notes for all frozen bill segments, click the Credit Note button without selecting any bill segments. A
system message asks for confirmation that credit notes will be created for all frozen bill segments.

To create credit notes for specific frozen bill segments, select just those bill segments.

When clicked, the Credit Note window opens.

You must specify the following parameters in the Credit Note window to cancel the frozen bill segments:

- **Cancel Reason defines why you are performing the cancellation.**

- **Accounting Date defines the financial period to which the canceled bill segments' financial transactions are booked. The**
current date defaults when the window opens.

- **Credit Note Date defines the date of the credit note on which the cancellation details appear. The current date defaults**
when the window opens.

After specifying the parameters, click Calculate to cancel the frozen bill segments and create a credit note.

It should be noted that if this operation is successful, the new "negative bill" is complete. It is ready for transmission to the
customer and for interface to the general ledger.

**NOTE:**
**If you want to issue a credit note for a specific bill segment. Rather than cancel all bill segments on a bill, you can**
create a credit note for a specific bill segment on a bill. To do this, drill down on the bill segment in question and then
click the Credit Note button on the bill segment page. You can also issue a credit note for selected bill segments on the
next tab by selecting the desired bill segments and clicking the Credit Note button.

###### Correction Note

The Correction Note button is used to cancel and rebill ALL bill segments and create a new bill that contains the
cancellation and rebill details. We refer to the resultant bill as a correction note. Refer to Correction Notes - Presenting
Correction Notes on a Separate Bill for more information.

This button is enabled if:


-----

- the Correction Note Billing Option is specified on the Installation record AND

- the bill is complete AND

- there is at least one frozen bill segment on the bill or all of the bill's bill segments are frozen or cancelled AND

- there are no bill segment financial transactions that have been transferred out of the system.

When clicked, the Correction Note window opens.

You must specify the following parameters in the Correction Note window to correct the bill segment:

- **Cancel Reason defines why you are performing the correction.**

- **Cutoff Date is the last possible day of each bill period for a bill segment. The current date defaults when the window**
opens. Refer to Ways To Control The End Date Of A Bill Segment for more information.

- **Accounting Date defines the financial period that the financial transactions are booked for a bill segment. The current**
date defaults when the window opens.

- Check Allow Estimatesto indicate if Oracle Utilities Meter Data Management should estimate consumption if it cannot
find a meter read.

- Use the Billing Option to define how the system looks for meter reads:

  - Select Use Schedule if the system should select reads based on the SA's SP measurement cycle schedule.

  - Select Use Cut off Date if the system should only select reads from the end date of the existing bill segment.

- If you prefer to have the system use the consumption details used on the original bill segments, check Use Old Read/
**Item/SQ. If this switch is on, neither Allow Estimates nor Billing Option is relevant.**

**NOTE:** The Use Old Read/Item/SQ switch is not available if the bill's SA references an SA type with a special role
flag of Bill Determinants Required.

- After specifying the parameters, click Calculate to correct the bill segments and create a correction note. The Bill Page
opens and displays the Correction Note.

Once you complete a correction note, it cannot be reopened.

After you create a correction note, the Undo Correction Note button is activated.

The button is enabled if:

- the Correction Note Billing Option is specified on the Installation record AND

- the bill is a correction note AND

- the bill is not linked to an off cycle bill generator AND

- all of the bill segments for the correction note are freezable.

**NOTE:**
**If you want to issue a correction note for a specific bill segment. You can create a correction note for a specific bill**
segment on a bill. To do this, drill down on the bill segment in question and then click the Correction Note button
on the bill segment page. You can also issue a correction note for selected bill segments by selecting the desired bill
segments and clicking theCorrection Note button.

###### Bill - Bill Segments

You can use this page to view all or selected bill segments linked to a bill. In addition, you can also perform certain
maintenance functions on this page (see the details below).

Open Menu > Financial > Bill > Search and navigate to the Bill Segments page to view this information.

**NOTE:**
If the bill has more than 25 bill segments and you don't use the go to buttons in the bill segment grid on the Main tab to
drill over to this information, the search criteria are intentionally left blank in order to avoid retrieving all bill segments
(with the resultant slow response times). You must therefore use the SA Filter and the Status Filter to define the type
of bill segments that should be retrieved. See the Description of page below for more information about this page's
search criteria.

The Description of page section below describes the fields on this page. Refer to How To for a description of how to
perform common maintenance functions.

**Description of page**

**Bill Info contains a concatenation of important information about the bill (e.g., the bill date, its status, due date, ending**
balance, etc.).

**Bill ID is the system-assigned unique identifier of the bill.**

**NOTE:**
If the bill has more than 25 bill segments and you don't use the hyperlinks in the bill segment grid on the Main tab to
drill over to this page, the Filters are intentionally left blank in order to avoid retrieving all bill segments (with the
resultant slow response times). You must therefore use the SA Filter and the Status Filter to define the type of bill
segments that should be retrieved.

The area beneath BillInfo provides you with options that control which bill segments appear in the grid. The following
points describe the various options:

- Use the SA Filter to define the types of service agreements whose bill segments appear in the grid. The following
options are available:

- Address. Use this option to restrict bill segments to those whose service agreements are linked to service points
associated with a given Address, City and/or Postal code. Note, you can specify any combination of these fields.

- All. Use this option if you do not wish to restrict bill segments based on service agreement attributes.


-----

- Geographic Type. Use this option to restrict bill segments to those whose service agreements are linked to service points
associated with a given Geo Type and Value.

- SA Type. Use this option to restrict bill segments to those whose service agreements are linked to a given CIS Division
and SA Type.

- Use Status Filter to restrict the bill segments based on their status. The following options are available:

- All. This option shows all bill segments regardless of status.

- Refer to Bill Segment Lifecycle for the various status values.

Don't forget to click the search button after changing the filters.

The Select All / Clear All buttons are used to select bill segments if you plan on issuing any of the mass update actions at
the bottom of the page. These buttons are enabled if either of the following conditions is true:

- All bill segments that appear in the grid are in the Error, Freezable and/or Incomplete states.

- All bill segments that appear in the grid are in the Frozen state

Refer to the description of the "mass update" actions below for more information.

**NOTE:**
**20 bill segments at a time. Clicking Select All selects the first 20 bill segments in the grid. If more than 20 bill**
segments exist, you must select them in batches.

The grid that follows contains the bill segments that match your search criteria. The following information appears in the
grid:

- Select box. See the mass update description immediately above for conditions under which this checkbox can be used to
select bill segments for mass update actions.

- The Bill Segment column contains a concatenation of the bill segment's division, SA type, status and bill period. The
division and SA type come from the bill segment's service agreement. Click the hyperlink to transfer to Bill Segment

  - Main Information. On this page you can perform maintenance functions (e.g., cancel/rebill, delete, cancel, etc.,
depending on the segment's status) on the bill segment in question.

- The Current Amount column contains the bill segment's effect on the service agreement's current balance.

- The Status shows the bill segment's status. Refer to Bill Segment Lifecycle for the possible values.

- The Remarks column highlights special circumstances associated with the bill segment.

- Rebill after completion appears if the bill segment is a rebill that was created after the bill was sent to the customer. The
financial impact of this bill segment appears as a "bill correction" on the next bill produced for the customer.

- Rebill prior completion appears if the bill segment is a rebill that was created before the bill was sent to the customer.

- Canceled after completion appears if the bill segment was canceled after the bill was sent to the customer. The financial
impact of this bill segment appears as a "bill correction" on the next bill produced for the customer.

- Canceled prior completion appears if the bill segment was canceled before the bill was sent to the customer.

- If the bill segment's status is Error or Incomplete, this column contains an estimated value of this bill segment. The
estimated value is calculated by computing an average daily amount from the service agreement's frozen bill segments in
the last 365 days. This average is then applied to the number of days in this bill segment's bill period. If the bill segment
doesn't have a bill period (rare, but possible), the historical average is not displayed.

- If the bill segment's status is Error, this column also contains the error message.

- Rebilled due to correction note appears if the correction note was generated for the bill segment. This remark is
generated only if you have Correction Note specified in the Installation record.

- Rebilled due to correction. Canceled after completion appears for a correction note that spawns another correction note.
This remark is generated only if you have Correction Note specified in the Installation record.


-----

- The Service Quantity and UOM (unit of measure) columns contain the amount of consumption that was billed. The
UOM is defined on the service agreement's SA type.

- The Bill Segment ID is the system-assigned unique identifier of the bill segment.

This transaction has sophisticated logic that can be used to perform "mass updates" to the bill segments that appear in the
grid (using the buttons at the bottom of the page). The following points describe these mass update actions:

###### Generate (Bill - Bill Segments)

The Generate button is used to delete and recreate one or more bill segments. This button is enabled if you select at least
one row from the bill segments grid that's in the Error, Freezable and/or Incomplete state.

Note that you can only select a bill segment for regeneration if ALL bill segments in the grid are in the Error, Freezable and/
or Incomplete states. Note, you can use the Status Filter to restrict the type of bill segments in the grid.

When clicked, the Generate window opens.

You must specify the following parameters in the Generate window to regenerate a new bill:

- **Accounting Date defines the financial period to which the new bill segments' financial transactions will be booked. The**
current date defaults when the window opens.

- Check Allow Estimatesto indicate if Oracle Utilities Meter Data Management should estimate consumption if it can't
find a meter read.

- If the service agreements use meter reads, use the Billing Option to control how the system retrieves meter reads that
appear on the bill. Choose Use Cut off Date if the meter reads must exist on the Cutoff Date (defined above). Choose
Use Schedule if you want the service agreement's service point(s) measurement cycle schedule to control the meter reads
that are used.

After specifying the parameters, click Calculate to regenerate the selected bill segments. A summary of what the system
does is presented next.

###### Freeze (Bill - Bill Segments)

The Freeze button is used to freeze one or more bill segments. This button is enabled if you select at least one row from the
bill segments grid that's in the Freezable state AND the installation option indicates users are allowed to "freeze at will".

Note that you can only select a bill segment for freezing if ALL bill segments in the grid are in the Freezable state. Note,
you can use the Status Filter to restrict the type of bill segments in the grid.

When clicked, the Freeze window opens.

**Accounting Date is used to define the financial period to which the frozen bill segments' financial transactions are booked.**
The current date defaults when the window opens.

After specifying the above parameters, click Freeze to freeze the selected bill segments. A summary of what the system
does is presented next.

###### Delete (Bill - Bill Segments)

The Delete button is used to delete one or more bill segments. This button is enabled if you select at least one row from the
bill segments grid that's in the Error, Freezable and/or Incomplete state.

Note that you can only select a bill segment for deletion if ALL bill segments in the grid are in the Error, Freezable and/or
Incomplete states. Note, you can use the Status Filter to restrict the type of bill segments in the grid.


-----

If the system is successful in deleting the selected bill segment(s), a confirmation window summarizes what the system just
did (i.e., it shows the number of bill segments that were deleted).

###### Cancel/Rebill/Freeze (Bill - Bill Segments)

If problems are detected with a frozen bill segment, it should be canceled and a new bill segment should be created. We
refer to this process as cancel / rebill. Refer to Cancel / Rebill Incorrect Bill Segments for more information.

Before you cancel / rebill, you'll probably need to fix the cause of the problem. The following table describes common
problems and how to fix them.

Problem How To Fix It

The wrong rate was used Go to Service Agreement - Rate Info and correct the rate.

The wrong meter was connected to the service point

A contract rider was applied incorrectly Go to Service Agreement - Rate Info and correct the contract rider

information.

The wrong tax exemption amount was calculated Go to Service Agreement - Rate Info and correct the tax exemption

information.

**NOTE:**
**Multi-Cancel/Rebill Saves Time. If the cause of the problem impacts many bill segments related to a service**
agreement, you should use the Multi Cancel Rebill transaction as it allows you to cancel / rebill an unlimited number of
bill segments at once. Also note that for service agreements that require bill determinants from Oracle Utilities Meter
Data Management, this transaction may only be used to cancel / rebill a single bill segment at a time.

**Credit Notes. Using the cancel/rebill functionality causes the cancel and rebill details to be swept on to the customer's**
next bill unless you Reopen the bill. If your organization requires cancellation details to be presented to the customer
separately from the new bill, you should not use the Rebill functionality. Rather, you should issue a Credit Note and
then generate a new bill containing the revised charges.

The Cancel/Rebill/Freeze button is used to cancel, rebill and freeze one or more bill segments. This button is enabled if
you select at least one row from the bill segments grid that's in the Frozen state AND the bill is not written off.

Note that you can only select a bill segment for cancel/rebill/freeze if ALL bill segments in the grid are in the Frozen state.
Note, you can use the Status Filter to restrict the type of bill segments in the grid.

When clicked, the Cancel/Rebill/Freeze window opens.

- **Cancel Reason defines why the bill segment(s) are being canceled.**

- **Accounting Date defines the financial period to which the canceled and new bill segments' financial transactions are**
booked. The current date defaults when the window opens.

- Check Allow Estimatesto indicate if Oracle Utilities Meter Data Management should estimate consumption if it cannot
find a meter read.

- Use the Billing Option to define how the system looks for meter reads:

  - Select Use Schedule if the system should select reads based on the SA's SP measurement cycle schedule.

  - Select Use Cut off Date if the system should only select reads from the end date of the existing bill segment.

  - If you prefer to have the system use the consumption details used on the original bill segments, check Use Old Read/
**Item/SQ. If this switch is on, neither Allow Estimates nor Billing Option is relevant.**


-----

**NOTE:** The Use Old Read/Item/SQ switch is not available if the bill's SA references an SA type with a special
role flag of Bill Determinants Required.

**WARNING:**
If the cause of the rebill is an incorrect rate and the new rate requires service quantities that were not calculated when the
bill was originally calculated, do not turn on Use Old Read/Item/SQ. Why? Because you want the system to derive new
service quantities during the rebill process.

After specifying the parameters, click Calculate to cancel, rebill and freeze the selected bill segments.

**NOTE:**
**Errors. Bill segment errors may occur when you cancel / rebill the bill segments. For example, if you change the SA's**
rate to a rate that requires a unit-of-measure that doesn't exist on the SA's meter, a bill segment error is generated. If this
occurs, you must go to Bill Segment - Main for the pending cancel bill segment and use the Undo action to remove the
offending bill segment (and restore the original segment to the Frozen state). Alternatively, you can drill down on the
Error bill segment and use the Regenerate action after correcting the cause of the problem.

**There is no Undo. Unlike cancel / rebills performed on Bill Segment - Main, there is no Undo action. This is because**
this transaction freezes the newly created bill segments after it cancel/rebills; whereas the bill segment transaction
lets you examine the new bill segment before you freeze it. If you made a mistake, simply correct the cause of the
mistake and then cancel / rebill again. The erroneous financial transactions are automatically suppressed on the next bill
produced for the customer.

A confirmation window summarizes what the system just did (i.e., it shows the number of bill segments that were deleted /
generated).

###### Cancel (Bill - Bill Segments)

The Cancel button is used to cancel one or more bill segments. This button is enabled if you select at least one row from the
bill segments grid that's in the Frozen state AND the bill is not written off.

Note that you can only select a bill segment for cancellation if ALL bill segments in the grid are in the Frozen state. Note,
you can use the Status Filter to restrict the type of bill segments in the grid.

When clicked, the Cancel window opens.

- **Cancel Reason defines why the bill segment(s) are being canceled.**

- **Accounting Date is used to define the financial period to which the canceled bill segments' financial transactions are**
booked. The current date defaults when the window opens.

After specifying the above parameters, click Calculate to cancel the selected bill segments.

**NOTE:**
**There is no Undo. Unlike cancellations performed on Bill Segment - Main, there is no Undo action. This transaction**
moves the pending cancel bill segments to the cancel state immediately; whereas the bill segment transaction lets you
examine the cancellation before you commit it. If you cancelled bill segments by mistake, you must generate and freeze
new bill segments.

###### Credit Note (Bill - Bill Segments)


-----

The Credit Note button is used to cancel selected bill segments and create a new bill that contains the cancellation details.
We refer to this "negative bill" as a credit note. Refer to Credit Notes - Presenting Cancellation Details on a Separate Bill
for more information.

This button is enabled if:

- the Use Credit Notes option on the Installation record is turned on AND

- if you select at least one row from the bill segments grid that's in the Frozen state AND

- the bill is not written off.

Note that you can only select a bill segment for this action if ALL bill segments in the grid are in the Frozen state. Note, you
can use the Status Filter to restrict the type of bill segments in the grid.

When clicked, the Credit Note window opens.

You must specify the following parameters in the Credit Note window to cancel the frozen bill segments:

- **Cancel Reason defines why you are performing the cancellation.**

- **Accounting Date defines the financial period to which the canceled bill segments' financial transactions are booked. The**
current date defaults when the window opens.

- **Credit Note Date defines the date of the credit note on which the cancellation details appear. The current date defaults**
when the window opens.

After specifying the parameters, click Calculate to cancel the frozen bill segments and create a credit note.

It should be noted that if this operation is successful, the new "negative bill" is complete. Refer to Bill Lifecycle for
information about the steps that take place during completion. It is ready for transmission to the customer and for interface
to the general ledger.

**NOTE:**
**If you want to issue a credit note for an entire bill. Rather than cancel a specific bill segment, functionality exists that**
allows you to create a credit note for ALL bill segments on a bill. To use this feature, display the bill in question and
then click the Credit Note button on the bill page.

###### Correction Note (Bill - Bill Segments)

The Correction Note button is used to cancel and rebill bill segments and create a new bill that contains the cancellation
and rebill details. We refer to the resultant bill as a correction note. Refer to Correction Notes - Presenting Correction Notes
on a Separate Bill for more information. This button is enabled if:

- the Correction Note option is specified on the Installation record AND

- the bill is complete AND

- the bill segment is frozen AND

- there are no bill segment financial transactions that have been transferred out of the system.

When clicked, the Correction Note window opens.

You must specify the following parameters in the Correction Note window to correct the bill segment:

- **Cancel Reason defines why you are performing the correction.**

- **Cutoff Date is the last possible day of each bill segments bill period. The current date defaults when the window opens.**
Refer to Ways To Control The End Date Of A Bill Segment for more information.

- **Accounting Date defines the financial period to which the corrected bill segments' financial transactions are booked.**
The current date defaults when the window opens.


-----

- Check Allow Estimatesto indicate if Oracle Utilities Meter Data Management should estimate consumption if it cannot
find a meter read.

- Use the Billing Option to define how the system looks for meter reads:

  - Select Use Schedule if the system should select reads based on the SA's SP measurement cycle schedule.

  - Select Use Cut off Date if the system should only select reads from the end date of the existing bill segment.

- If you prefer to have the system use the consumption details used on the original bill segments, check Use Old Read/
**Item/SQ. If this switch is on, neither Allow Estimates nor Billing Option is relevant.**

**NOTE:** The Use Old Read/Item/SQ switch is not available if the bill's SA references an SA type with a special role
flag of Bill Determinants Required.

- After specifying the parameters, click Calculate to correct the bill segments and create a correction note. The Bill Page
opens and displays the Correction Note.

**NOTE:**
**If you want to issue a correction note for an entire bill. You can create a correction note for ALL bill segments on a**
bill. To use this feature, display the bill in question on the Bill page and click the Correction Note button.

###### Bill - Bill Routings

This page is used to view the recipients of a bill. Refer to Printing Bills for a discussion of how this information is used to
produce bill images.

This page is also used to request a new copy of a bill. Refer to How To Reprint A Bill (For The Original Recipients or For
Someone New) for a description of how to do this.

**NOTE:**
**No routing information until completion. A bill has no routing details until it is completed. At completion time,**
the system creates a routing detail for every person linked to the account that receives a copy of its bills. Refer to The
Source Of Bill Routing Information for more information about how this information is constructed.

Use Menu > Financial > Bill > Search and navigate to the Bill Routings page.

**Description of Page**

**Bill Info contains a concatenation of important information about the bill (e.g., the bill date, its status, due date, ending**
balance). If sequential bill numbering has been enabled, the bill's number also appears.

**Bill ID is the system-assigned unique identifier of the bill.**

The Bill Routing Information scroll contains an entry for each recipient of the bill. This information is disabled after
the bill has been routed to the recipient. The remainder of this discussion describes the fields that can be defined for each
recipient of the bill.

**Person ID identifies the person who was originally associated with the routing record. You may change the Person ID to**
any person in the system as this information is only used to default the recipient's name and address information, below.

The Bill Routing Parameters area contains information explaining how and when the bill is routed to the recipient. This
information is gray when the rill routing information has been extracted or if a bill is reopened:

- **Bill Route Type is the method used to transmit the bill to the customer. If the Person ID is linked to the account, the bill**
route type defaults from the person's Account - Person Information.

- **Sequence is the system-assigned identifier assigned to this bill routing.**


-----

- **Batch Control is the identifier of the batch of bills in which the recipient's copy was downloaded. The batch process is**
defined on the Bill Route Type or CIS Division.

- **Extract Date/Time is the date and time the bill was downloaded. This information only appears after the download has**
commenced.

- **Format indicates if the customer should receive a Detailed or a Summary bill. If the Person ID is linked to the account,**
this information defaults from Account - Person Information.

- **Reprint is checked if a user created this routing. This switch is populated by the system and is always protected.**

- Turn on Do Not Extract if the bill should not be routed to the individual for whatever reason.

- **Copies indicates the number of copies of the bill the person receives. If the Person ID is linked to the account, this**
information defaults from Account - Person Information.

- **PO ID is the purchase order Id the customer wants printed on their copy of the bill. If the Person ID is linked to the**
account, this information defaults from Account - Person Information.

- **Intercept is the User ID of the individual who wants to review the bill before it is sent to the customer. This field**
is automatically populated when the account has a Bill Print Intercept specified (intercept information is defined on
Account - Main Information). For a one-time intercept, a user can enter their ID in this field before the bill, or reprint,
has been extracted.

**NOTE:** Adding a User ID to the Intercept field will not automatically populate the Bill Print Intercept field on the
Account’s Main page; nor, will it affect future bill routings.

The Mailing Address Information area contains the recipient's name and address.

- If the recipient has anoverride mailing name, Name1, Name2 and Name3 contain the person's override mailing name.
Otherwise, Name1 contains the recipient's primary name (this name might also include a prefix or suffix if the related
Account - Person relationship has these fields defined).

- The remaining fields are the recipient's address. Refer to The Source Of Bill Routing Information for information about
how the system constructs the recipient's address. Note:

- If the recipient's address is a mailing address (as opposed to fax or email), the Country associated with the address
controls the fields that appear in the address. Refer to Defining Countries for more information on the address
constituents.

- If a user manually adds a routing record, the mailing address information defaults from the information on the current
routing record.

- If a user specifies a Person ID that is linked to the bill's account, the Bill Route Type defined on the Account - Person
record is defaulted.

- If a user specifies a Person ID that is not linked to the bill's account, the Bill Route Type on theinstallation record is
defaulted. Note, if the bill route indicates the bill is routed via the postal service, the system will only be able to default
the person's address if the person has an override mailing address on their correspondence information.

- If the user changes the Bill Route Type after the initial default, the system populates the address information as
described under The Source Of Bill Routing Information.

- The Validate button on the bill page will only be available if you have set the Allow Address Validation option type to Y
on the General System Configuration feature configuration. Once clicked, the Address Validation Script on the General
System Configuration feature configuration will be invoked to validate the entered address. Refer to Implementing
Address Validation for more information.

###### How To

The topics in this section describe how to perform common bill maintenance functions.

###### How To Create A Bill For All Service Agreements Linked To An Account

99.9% of all bills are created by the batch bill process and require no human intervention before they are finalized and sent
to a customer. The other 0.1% are created by users on-line / real time. This section explains how to create the 0.1%.

The following points describe how to use this page to create a new bill:

- Navigate to the Bill - Main Information page:

- If you have already selected the customer (say on Control Central), select Go To Bill > Add option on the account
context menu. context menu. This will transfer you to this page with the respective account populated.

- If you haven't selected the account, use Menu to navigate to this page (Menu > Financial > Bill > Add) and then select
the Account ID using the adjacent search button.

- Click the Generate button to create a new bill.

- You will see a summary of the bill segments in the lower right portion of the page. If there are errors, refer to How To
Correct A Bill Segment That's In Error. If there are no errors, the Bill Segment Freeze Option on the installation option
controls the next step:

- If this option is set to Freeze At Bill Completion, click the Freeze / Complete button.

- If this option is set to Freeze At Will, click the Freeze button and, if everything looks clean, click the Complete button.

###### How To Create A Bill For A Specific Service Agreement

Most bills contain a bill segment for every service agreement linked to the account. If you want to produce a bill that
contains bill segments for a subset of service agreements (e.g., you want to create a one-time invoice for an account's
billable charge service agreement), follow these steps:

- Navigate to the Bill - Main Information page:

- If you have already selected the customer (say on Control Central), select Go To Bill > Add option on the account
context menu. context menu. This will transfer you to this page with the respective account populated.

- If you haven't selected the account, use Menu to navigate to Menu > Financial > Bill > Add, and then select the
**Account ID using the adjacent search button.**

- Click the save button to create a bill without bill segments for the account.

- Select Go To Bill Segment + option on the Bill's context menu to transfer to Bill Segment - Main.

- Select the SA ID of the service agreement for which you want to create a bill segment.

- Click the Generate button to generate a bill segment.

  - If an error exists, refer to How To Correct A Bill Segment That's In Error.

  - If there are no errors, the Bill Segment Freeze Option on the installation option controls the next step:

  - If this option is set to Freeze At Bill Completion, return to Bill - Main (using the bill context menu) and click the
Freeze / Complete button.


-----

  - If this option is set to Freeze At Will, click the Freeze button and, if everything looks clean, return to Bill - Main and
click the Complete button.

###### How To Create a Bill with no Bill Segments

You may wish to generate a bill that contains no bill segments. For example, perhaps your customer is billed quarterly but
pays monthly. During the months where no charges are calculated, you may choose to send a "bill" that does not show new
charges, but includes the payments received. To produce a bill with no bill segments, follow these steps:

- Navigate to the Bill - Main Information page:

- If you have already selected the customer (say on Control Central), select Go To Bill > Add option on the account
context menu. context menu. This will transfer you to this page with the respective account populated.

- If you haven't selected the account, use Menu to navigate to this page (Menu > Financial > Bill > Add) and then select
the Account ID using the adjacent search button.

- Click the save button to create a bill without bill segments for the account.

- At this point either the Complete or Freeze / Complete button (based on the value of Bill Segment Freeze Option on
installation options) becomes enabled. Click the applicable button for your installation to complete the bill. At this
point, all the steps described for completing a bill in Bill Lifecycle are performed, including sweeping onto the bill any
payments received since the last bill was generated.

###### How To Create A One-Time Invoice

The following points describe the steps necessary to create and bill a one-time invoice:

- If the customer to be invoiced doesn't already have an appropriate billable charge service agreement, create one. The
easiest way to do this is from Start/Stop Service.

- Use Maintaining Billable Charges to add a billable charge for the service agreement. The billable charge contains the
invoice lines and amounts. The system will produce the bill for this charge when the account's bill cycle next executes. If
you can't wait until that time, proceed to the next step.

- If you created a new billable charge service agreement in step 1, you must activate it before billing can bill it. To do this,
transfer to Service Agreement - Main Information and click the activate button.

- Refer to How To Create A Bill For A Specific Service Agreement for instructions describing how to create a bill with a
bill segment for the billable charge service agreement.

###### How To Correct A Bill Segment That's In Error

A bill segment will exist in the Error state if a problem was encountered during the generation of a bill segment. To fix an
error bill segment you must correct the cause of the error and then regenerate the bill segment. Refer to Bill Segment Errors
for background information.

**NOTE:**
**Error segments created during batch billing. If the error bill segment was created as part of the batch bill process,**
the system attempts to fix the offending segment(s) each night during the account's bill window by regenerating it.
Therefore, if the cause of the error is fixed during the day, the system will automatically regenerate the bill segment


-----

when batch billing next runs; you don't have to manually correct each bill. And once a bill is error-free, it will be
completed and sent to the customer. Refer to Batch Billing for more information.

Correcting the cause of a bill segment error can be difficult or trivial; we hope that the error messages (along with their long
descriptions) provide a good description of how to resolve the issue.

After you have corrected the cause of the error, you should regenerate the bill segment. There are two ways to do this:

- You can use the Generate action on Bill - Bill Segment to regenerate one or more bill segments. We recommend using
this method if the cause of the error affected many bill segments because you can regenerate many bill segments at a
time on this page. Also, be aware that this transaction shows the estimated value of error bill segments so you can gauge
whether to invest a lot of time in correcting the problem. For example, if the bill segment's estimated value is $10,000,
it's probably worth correcting the problem before sending the bill out. However, if the bill segment's value is small, you
may decide to simply delete the error bill segment and send the bill without it (the system will attempt to create a bill for
the deleted period the next time the account is billed).

- You can use the Generate action on Bill Segment - Main to regenerate an individual bill segment. We'd recommend
using this method if the problem is bill segment-specific and you need to examine the information that is snapshot on the
bill segment to resolve the error (e.g., you need to look at calculation/audit read details and service quantities).

**NOTE:**
**Drilling Into Bill Segment Errors. When you use the bill segments in error To Do list to work through errors, you will**
be transferred to Bill Segment - Main with the bill segment displayed.

After all errors have been resolved on a bill, return to Bill - Main. The Bill Segment Freeze Option on the installation
option controls the next step:

- If this option is set to Freeze At Bill Completion, click the Freeze / Complete button.

- If this option is set to Freeze At Will, click the Freeze button and, if everything looks clean, click the Complete button.

###### How To Correct A Bill That's In Error

Besides errors on bill segments, there may also be errors detected when the system attempts to complete a bill. For example,
if the system cannot find a mailing address, the bill will be in error (as opposed to one of its bill segments). Refer to Bill
Errors for background information.

To correct such an error:

- Navigate to Bill - Main.

- Look at the bill's error message. Push the view button to view the long explanation that will provide suggestions as to the
cause of the error (and how to fix it). Transfer to the appropriate page to fix the problem.

- After fixing the cause of the error, return to Bill - Main. The Bill Segment Freeze Option on the installation option
controls the next step:

- If this option is set to Freeze At Bill Completion, click the Freeze / Complete button.

- If this option is set to Freeze At Will, click the Freeze button and, if everything looks clean, click the Complete button.

###### How To Cancel A Bill Segment

If a bill segment was frozen and it should never have been created in the first place, the bill segment must be canceled.
There are several ways to do this:


-----

- You can use the Cancel Frozen action on Bill - Main to cancel all frozen bill segments linked to the bill. We recommend
using this method if you need to cancel everything on a bill.

- You can use the Cancel action on Bill - Bill Segments to cancel selected bill segments. We recommend using this
method if you need to cancel multiple bill segments.

- You can use the Cancel action on Bill Segment - Main to cancel an individual bill segment. We'd recommend using this
method if you need to examine the information on the bill segment before canceling it.

If the related bill is pending, the cancellation will cause the bill segment to be suppressed on the version of the bill sent to
the customer (but it remains in the database for audit and financial reporting purposes).

If the related bill is complete and you do not Reopen the bill, the financial impact of the canceled bill segment(s) will appear
on the next bill created for the account (under Bill Corrections).

If the related bill is complete you may be able to Reopen the bill and then Complete it. By doing this, you can suppress
a frozen bill segment on a previously completed bill. This means that if you catch a problem after completion you don't
necessarily have to show the problem to the customer. Rather, cancel the problem, reopen and then recomplete the bill
(when you recomplete the bill the system will mark the bill segment to be suppressed on the version sent to the customer
because its cancellation appears on the same bill as the original charges).

###### How To Cancel / Rebill A Bill Segment

If a bill segment was frozen but it contains incorrect information, it should be canceled and a new bill segment should be
created. We refer to this process as cancel / rebill. Refer to Cancel / Rebill Incorrect Bill Segments for more information.

Before you cancel / rebill, you must correct the cause of the problem. The following table describes common problems and
where to go to fix them.

Problem How To Fix It

The wrong rate was used Go to Service Agreement - Rate Info and correct the rate.

The wrong meter was connected to the service point

A contract rider was applied incorrectly Go to Service Agreement - Rate Info and correct the contract rider

information.

The wrong tax exemption amount was calculated Go to Service Agreement - Rate Info and correct the tax exemption

information.

After correcting the cause of the problem, you're ready to cancel and rebill the offending bill segment(s). There are several
ways to do this:

- You can use the Cancel / Rebill / Freeze action on Bill - Bill Segments to cancel, rebill and freeze selected bill segments.
We recommend using this method if you need to cancel / rebill multiple bill segments due to a pervasive problem.

- You can use the Rebill action on Bill Segment - Main to cancel and rebill an individual bill segment. We'd recommend
using this method if you need to examine the information on the bill segment before and after canceling it. If you use this
method, you must also use the Freeze action to freeze the newly created bill segment.

- If the cause of the problem impacts many bill segments related to a service agreement, you should use the Multi Cancel
Rebill transaction as it allows you to cancel / rebill an unlimited number of bill segments at once. Also note that for
service agreements that require bill determinants from Oracle Utilities Meter Data Management, this transaction may
only be used to cancel / rebill a single bill segment at a time.

If the related bill is pending, the cancellation will cause the erroneous bill segment to be suppressed on the version of the
bill sent to the customer (but it remains in the database for audit and financial reporting purposes).

If the related bill is complete and you do not Reopen the bill, the financial impact of the canceled bill segment(s) and their
rebill bill segment(s) will appear on the next bill created for the account (under Bill Corrections).


-----

If the related bill is complete you may be able to Reopen the bill and then Complete it. By doing this, you can suppress an
erroneous frozen bill segment on a previously completed bill. This means that if you catch a problem after completion you
don't necessarily have to show the problem to the customer. Rather, cancel / rebill the problem, reopen and then recomplete
the bill (when you recomplete the bill the system will mark the bill segment to be suppressed on the version sent to the
customer because its cancellation appears on the same bill as the original charges).

###### How To Create A Credit Note

A credit note is used to cancel bills segments and present the results of this cancellation on a separate bill. This separate
bill is referred to as a credit note. Refer to Credit Notes - Presenting Cancellation Details on a Separate Bill for more
information.

**NOTE:**
**Installation option must be turned on. If your organization creates credit notes, be sure to select the Credit Note**
Billing Option on the Installation Options. If you don't select this option, the credit note buttons will not be enabled.

Before creating a credit note, you must first determine whether a single bill segment must be canceled or whether all bill
segments for a bill must be canceled:

- If you need to issue a credit note for the entire bill, navigate to the Bill page and click the Credit Note button.

- If you need to issue a credit note for a specific bill segment, navigate to the Bill Segment page and click the Credit Note
button.

**NOTE:**
**Open-item customers. If any of the bill segments are associated with an open-item customer class AND the original**
bill segment is an open item, the match event will be created and balanced with the original FT and the cancellation FT,
assuming you have the appropriate FT freeze algorithm plugged-in on the customer class.

**Issuing a credit note for a specific bill segment. You may also issue a credit note for an individual bill segment. When**
you create a credit note for an individual bill segment, that bill segment is canceled and a new credit note bill is created
for that single bill segment's cancellation information.

###### How To Create A Correction Note

The Correction Note button is used to cancel and rebill bill segments and present the cancellation and rebill details on a
separate bill. Refer to Correction Notes - Presenting Correction Notes on a Separate Bill for more information.

**NOTE:**
**Installation option must be turned on. If your organization creates correction notes, be sure to select the Correction**
Note Billing Option on the Installation Options. If you don't select this option, the correction note buttons will not be
enabled.

Before creating a correction note, you must first determine whether the note should impact a single bill segment or whether
all bill segments for a bill must be corrected:

- If you need to issue a correction note for the entire bill, navigate to the Bill page and click the Correction Note button.

- If you need to issue a correction note for a specific bill segment, navigate to the Bill Segment page and click the
Correction Note button.

**NOTE:**


-----

**Open-item customers. If any of the bill segments are associated with an open-item customer class AND the original**
bill segment is an open item, the match event will be created and balanced with the original FT and the cancellation FT,
assuming you have the appropriate FT freeze algorithm plugged in on the customer class.

**Issuing a correction note for a specific bill segment. You can also issue a correction note for an individual bill**
segment. When you create a correction note for an individual bill segment, that bill segment is canceled and a new
correction note bill is created for that single bill segment's cancellation information.

###### How To Create An Off Cycle Bill Generator

An off cycle bill generator is used to create an off cycle bill for an account. You control the financial transactions that are
linked to the bill. To create a bill using the base off cycle bill generator business object, follow these steps:

- With an account in context, select Account Context Menu > Go To Off Cycle Bill Generator +.(See context menu for
_more information about Context Menus.) This will transfer you to this portal with the respective account populated._

- Select the adjustments, billable charges and/or service agreements that you wish to include in the bill.

- Enter the required bill information to be used when creating the bill; this includes the Cutoff Date, Accounting Date,
Allow Estimates switch, Billing Option and Bill Date.

- Click the save button.

- Click the Complete button to transition the off cycle bill generator to the complete state and create the bill. Any errors
encountered while attempting to create the bill will be captured in the off cycle bill generator's log.

- Refer to Off Cycle Bill Generator for more information.

###### How To Override The Items Billed On A Specific Bill Segment

The How the System Requests How Much Was Consumed used by the customer is one of the first steps that happens
when a bill segment is created. 99.9% of the time, the system does a perfect job in this effort. However, there are rare
circumstances when, due to missing or incorrect data, the quantity calculated by the system is not correct.

To help you deal with these rare situations, a "back door" exists that allows a bill segment's billable quantities to be
overridden. This truly is a "back door" because the proper way to fix the amount of a commodity is to correct the cause of
the error and then cancel / rebill the bill segment.

This section describes how to override the total number of items billed on a bill segment. You would do this in the rare
situation when you cannot get the item snapshot to reflect the amount of consumption you need to bill.

- Display the error or freezable bill segment on Bill Segment - Main.

**IMPORTANT:**
You can only override consumption on a bill segment that is in Error or Freezable. This means you must generate a bill
segment before you can override the item details.

- Transfer to the Bill Segment - Item Details tab.

- Insert one row in the item grid (click the + button) for each item you need to add. You may also change item amounts
that were populated by the system when it initially generated the bill.

- Save the bill segment.

- Generate the bill segment.

- If the bill segment still looks wrong, repeat the above points until the bill segment is correct.


-----

- The Bill Segment Freeze Option on the installation option controls the next step:

- If this option is set to Freeze At Bill Completion, return to Bill - Main (using the bill context menu) and click the Freeze /
Complete button.

- If this option is set to Freeze At Will, click the Freeze button and, if everything looks clean, return to Bill - Main and
click the Complete button.

###### How To Remove Unwanted Adjustments (or Payments) From A Completed Bill

If the system (or a user) has created adjustments that have been swept onto a recently completed bill but you don't want
them to appear on the bill (e.g., the system generated a late payment charge but you want to forgive it) perform the
following steps:

- Cancel the adjustment ( Adjustment - Main Information).

- Navigate to the Bill - Main page.

- Click the Reopen button to reopen the previously completed bill.

- Click the Complete button to recomplete the bill. When the bill is recompleted, the system will see that an adjustment
that was swept onto the bill when it was originally completed has been canceled and it will mark the adjustment for
suppression on the printed bill.

You can remove unwanted payments using an analogous approach - Cancel the payment, Reopen the bill, Complete the bill.

**NOTE:**
**Cannot reopen historical bills. You may only reopen an account's most recent bill because recompleting the bill causes**
the ending-balance to change, and we don't want this to happen to historical bills.

###### How To Add An Adjustment (or Payment) To A Completed Bill

If you want to add an adjustment to a completed bill perform the following steps:

- Add and freeze the adjustment ( Adjustment - Main Information).

- Navigate to the Bill - Main page.

- Click the Reopen button to reopen the previously completed bill.

- Click the Complete button to recomplete the bill. When the bill is recompleted, the system will sweep the recently
created financial transactions onto itself.

You can add a payment to a bill using an analogous approach - Add the payment, Reopen the bill, Complete the bill.

**NOTE:**
**Cannot reopen historical bills. You may only reopen an account's most recent bill because recompleting the bill causes**
the ending-balance to change, and we don't want this to happen to historical bills.

###### How To Reprint A Bill (For The Original Recipients or For Someone New)


-----

A copy of a bill is sent to every individual / business specified in the bill's routing details. The system creates the routing
details when a bill is completed. Refer to The Source Of Bill Routing Information for more information about how this
information is compiled during bill completion.

If you want to reprint a bill OR if you want to send a bill to someone other than the original recipient(s):

- Navigate to the Bill - Main page.

- Transfer to the Bill - Bill Routings tab.

- Insert a new row (click the + button). Note well, you can only insert information on a bill that is Complete.

- Specify the name and address to which the bill should be sent. If you want to send the bill to someone other than the
original recipient, simply specify the individual's name and address. If the recipient is a person in the system, you can
select their person ID and let the system default this information for you.

- Save the bill.

**NOTE:**
If a bill is Complete but the print process hasn't yet executed, you don't have to insert a new routing row. Rather, you can
simply change the name and address on the original routing details.

###### How To Add Ad Hoc Messages To A Bill

If you want to add a message to a completed bill:

- Navigate to the Bill - Main page.

- Transfer to the Bill - Bill Messages tab.

- Insert a new row (click the + button). Note, you can only insert a message on the most recent bill that is Complete.

- Specify the desired message code.

- Save the bill.

- Reprint the bill as per How To Reprint A Bill (For The Original Recipients or For Someone New).

**FASTPATH:**
Refer to The Source Of Bill Messages for more information about the messages the system automatically links to a bill
when the bill is completed.

###### How To Remove A Completed Bill

You can't physically remove a completed bill from the system. However, you can remove all financial transactions from the
bill (and therefore end up with a zero value bill). You can also suppress the bill from being printed. To do this, perform the
following steps:

- If the bill has bill segments, cancel each bill segment. Refer to How To Cancel A Bill Segment for instructions
describing how to do this.

- If the bill has payment amounts or adjustment amounts that were entered incorrectly, navigate to the payment and/or
adjustment pages and cancel the payments / adjustments.

- Navigate to the Bill - Main page.

- Click the Reopen button to reopen the previously completed bill.

- Transfer to the Bill - Bill Routings tab. Turn on the Do Not Print switch for every routing entry.


-----

- Click the Complete button to recomplete the bill. When the bill is recompleted, the system will sweep the canceled
segments onto it and the net effect should be zero current charges.

**NOTE:**
**Cannot reopen historical bills. You may only reopen an account's most recent bill because recompleting the bill causes**
the ending balance to change, and we don't want this to happen to historical bills.

If the bill has payment amounts or adjustment amounts that are valid, but you don't want them to appear on this bill,
navigate to the Menu > Financial > Bill > Search and navigate to the Financial Details page. Drill over to each
respective financial transaction by clicking the drill down button. Clicking this button transfers you to Financial
Transaction - Main. On this page, clear out the value of the Bill ID. Clearing out the Bill ID unlinks the financial transaction
from the bill. When the system next completes a bill for the account, it will find the unbilled financial transaction and link it
to the bill.

###### How To Display A Bill On-line

There are multiple ways to display a bill. Each requires the use of the Installation Option — Online Bill Display plug-in
spot.

- One method is to make a call to retrieve a bill image from an external source. Many bill print vendors support this
method and support REST or web service calls to request the bill image, often in the PDF format. The system is
delivered with an algorithm that can construct a URL to retrieve a bill image.

- Another method uses software to render the bill in a format suitable for displaying. You must configure the system to
invoke this software; otherwise, you will get a message indicating that the service is not available. This option can only
be configured by your technical staff. The system can be configured to work with different bill production software, and
is delivered with an algorithm that can display a bill on-line using BI Publisher or a document composition application.
With a document composition application, the bills are presented in PDF format.

To view a bill on-line, click the Display Bill button. For any method that present the bill as a PDF, you must have Adobe[®]
Acrobat[®] Reader installed.

###### Financial Transactions On A Bill

Open Menu > Financial Query > Financial Transactions On A Bill to view this information.

**NOTE:**
You can also open this page using the go to buttons that prefix the financial transaction summaries on Bill - Main.

**Description of page**

##### Maintaining Bill Segments

A bill typically contains one bill segment for every active service agreement linked to its account. A bill segment contains
information showing how the segment was calculated and how it should be printed on the customer's bill.

The actions taken to create a bill segment are dependent on the service agreement's SA type. For example, a service
agreement that charges for metered service is produced as follows:

- The system requests for the amount or usage consumed (or billing determinants) from Oracle Utilities Meter Data
Management (e.g., the number of lamps, the number of gallons of water, the peak kW, etc.). Refer to How the System
Requests How Much Was Consumed for the details.

- The service agreement's rate is applied to the amount consumed to calculate how much the customer owes for the
service. A bill segment and a financial transaction are generated to reflect the results of this calculation. Refer to
How Rates Affect The Information On Bill Segments for the details. Refer to Effective Dates & Price Proration for
information about how the system prorates changes to rates and prices during a bill period.

**NOTE:**
**SA type controls everything. The above points explain how a bill segment is produced for a bill determinants**
**required service agreement. It's important to be aware that the system has other bill segment creation algorithms. For**
example, if the service agreement charges for a deposit, the system neither amalgamates consumption nor does it apply
a rate. You may be wondering how the system knows which method to use? It uses the bill segment type on the service
agreement's SA type. Refer to Designing and Defining Bill Segment Types for a description of the various bill segment
creation algorithms that are supported in the system.

It's important to be aware that there are very few fields that are directly modifiable by a user. To modify most fields on a
bill segment, you have to change source information (e.g., service agreement, rate, meter read) and then regenerate the bill
segment. For example, if you want to change the rate used to calculate a bill segment, you must change the rate history on
the respective service agreement and then cancel / rebill the bill segment. Refer to How To for step-by-step instructions that
explain how to perform common bill segment maintenance functions.

###### Bill Segment Lifecycle

The following diagram shows the possible lifecycle of a bill segment.

**WARNING:**
This diagram only makes sense in the context of the page used to maintain bill segments. Refer to Bill Segment - Main
Information for the details.


-----

Bill segments are initially created in the Incomplete state. Bill segments in this state don't have bill lines or a financial
transaction; they are simply a stub awaiting generation.

Click Generate to generate the bill segment's bill lines and its financial transaction.

- If the system cannot generate the bill segment (for any number of reasons), the bill segment is moved to the Error state.
You may regenerate the bill segment after correcting the source of the error (by clicking Generate). You may also delete
such a bill segment.

- If the system successfully generates a bill segment, the bill segment becomes Freezable. If the bill segment is incorrect,
correct the cause of the problem (e.g., fix the meter read, change the service agreement's rate) and regenerate the bill
segment (by clicking Generate).

Click the delete button to physically remove an Incomplete, Error or Freezable bill segment from the database. Note, batch
billing will delete unfrozen bill segments when it attempts to create bill segments for an account that has unfrozen bill
segments. Also note, if you've plugged-in the appropriate pre-completion algorithm, the system will delete bill segments in
error on the last night of the bill cycle. Refer to DEL-BSEG for more information.

Click Freeze to freeze a bill segment and its financial transaction. After doing this, the bill segment's state becomes Frozen
and the bill segment may now appear on a customer's bill. Also note, when a bill segment is frozen, its financial details will
be interfaced to the general ledger the next time the GL interface executes.

You may not change a bill segment once it is frozen. However, you have two options if you want to change a frozen bill
segment's financial impact:

- If you need to remove the financial effects of a bill segment, click Init Cancel. Clicking this button causes a new
financial transaction to be generated and linked to the bill segment. This financial transaction reverses the financial
effects of the original bill segment. The bill segment becomes Pending Cancel after the system successfully generates
this financial transaction. At this point, you have two options:


-----

- Click Cancel to freeze the cancellation. Clicking this button causes the bill segment to move to the Canceled state. Once
canceled, the bill segment cannot be uncanceled or changed.

- Click Undo to return the pending cancellation to the Frozen state.

- Click Rebill if you need to recalculate the bill segment because something has changed since it was originally created
(e.g., the service agreement's rate was changed, a new read was entered). Clicking this button causes the following events
to take place:

- The original bill segment is moved to the Pending Cancel state.

- A new bill segment is created in the Freezable (or Error ) state.

At this point, you have two options.

- Click Freeze to make the new bill segment Frozen and make the original bill segment Canceled.

**NOTE:**
**Multi-Cancel/Rebill Saves Time. If you need to rebill many bill segments related to a service agreement (e.g., because**
many bill segments were created using the wrong rate), you should use the Multi Cancel Rebill transaction as it allows
you to cancel / rebill an unlimited number of bill segments at once. Also note that for service agreements that require bill
determinants from Oracle Utilities Meter Data Management, this transaction may only be used to cancel / rebill a single
bill segment at a time.

Using the cancel and cancel/rebill functionality will cause the cancel and rebill details to be swept on to the customer's
next bill. If your organization requires cancellation details to be presented to the customer separately from the new bill,
then you will need to use Credit Notes. Refer to Credit Notes - Presenting Cancellation Details on a Separate Bill for
more information.

- Click Undo to delete the new bill segment and return the original bill segment to the Frozen state.

###### Bill Segment - Main Information

**FASTPATH:**
The Description of Page section below describes the fields on this page. Refer to How To for a description of how to
perform common bill maintenance functions.

The Main page contains core bill segment information. Open Menu > Financial > Bill Segment > Search to view this
information.

**NOTE:**
Most bill segments are created by a background process. Refer to A High Level Overview Of The Bill Creation Process
for information describing how the system creates a bill segment.

**Description of Page**

**Bill Seg Info is a concatenation of the bill segment's division, SA type, status, bill period and amount. Bill Segment ID is**
the system-assigned unique identifier of the bill segment.

**Account ID references the bill segment's account.**

**Current Amount is the bill segment's effect on the service agreement's current balance. Payoff Amount is only shown if it**
differs from current amount. Refer to Billing - Current Balance versus Payoff Balance for more information.

**Bill ID is the system-assigned unique identifier of the bill on which the bill segment appears. A concatenation of its bill**
date, status, due date and amount is displayed.


-----

**SAID contains information about the bill segment's service agreement. A concatenation of the service agreement's division,**
SA type, start option (if any), status and start date is displayed.

If the quotation module is not turned off, you can generate simulated bill segments when you create a quote. You can
view simulated bill segments by drilling down on the desired bill segment from Quote - Quote Details. When a simulated
bill segment is displayed on this page, the Billing Scenario ID that controlled the bill segment's billing period (and
consumption) is displayed. Refer to Creating Quotes And Quote Details for more information.

**Period is the start and end dates of the bill segment.**

**Usage Period is the period used by Oracle Utilities Meter Data Management to determine the correct interval data to**
process for the bill segment. This field appears when the bill segment is for an SA that has Bill Determinants Required for
the special role flag.

**Bill Cycle displays the bill cycle and window start date of the bill segment's bill. This information is only populated on bills**
when they are generated on-schedule by the batch billing background process. Bills generated manually, i.e. off-schedule,
do not have this information.

**Status is the bill segment's status. Refer to Bill Segment Lifecycle for the potential values and how to handle a bill segment**
when it exists in a given state.

If the Closing switch is on, this is the final bill segment for the service agreement (i.e., the service agreement has been
stopped and this is the final bill segment).

**NOTE:**
The closing switch is not set for sub SA bill segments nor billable charge SA bill segments.

If the Estimate switch is on, consumption on this bill segment has been estimated by the system.

If the SQ Override switch is on, a user has overridden the service quantities (i.e., the amount of consumption for which the
customer is charged is not consistent with the customer's meter reads). This switch is also set if a user has overridden the
calculation/audit read details.

If the Item Override switch is on, a user has overridden the type and/or number of items (i.e., the type/number of items for
which the customer is charged is not consistent with the customer's service point information). Refer to How To Override
The Items Billed On A Specific Bill Segment for more information.

If this bill segment was created for a sub service agreement where we calculate the charges (i.e., not for a "pass through"
billing situation):

- **SA Rel ID shows the unique identifier of the record that defines the relationship between the sub service agreement and**
the master service agreement (this record shows the service provider associated with the bill segment). Click the go to
button to transfer to this record.

- **Master Bseg ID shows the unique identifier of the master bill segment whose bill triggered the creation of this sub**
service agreement. This bill segment's consumption was used to calculate the charges on this bill segment.

**Premise is the address of the main premise associated with the service agreement (as defined on the service agreement's**
characteristic premise). It's important to note that the service agreement may cover service at multiple premises, but only
one may be defined as the main premise.

**Create Dt/Tm is the date and time on which the bill segment was created or regenerated.**

In the Message area, a brief error message appears if there's a problem with the bill segment. The message area is
suppressed if there are no problems with the bill.

Push the magnifying glass button to view the long explanation. The long explanation will provide information about the
cause of the error (and how to fix it).

If the bill segment is a rebill of a canceled bill segment, a reference to the original bill segment is displayed. Click the

**Mass update actions. This page allows you to work on individual bill segments. If you want to update many bill**
segments linked to a bill at once, try using the mass update actions available on Bill -Bill Segments.

###### Generate (Bill Segment)

Click the Generate button to create a new a bill segment.

This button is enabled when either of the following conditions is true:

- You are in add mode (i.e., you are not displaying an existing bill segment) and you have selected an Account ID, Bill ID
and SA ID.

- You are displaying a bill segment that is Incomplete, Error, or Freezable. Refer to Bill Segment Lifecycle for more
information about these status values.

When clicked, the Generate window opens.

You must specify the following parameters to generate a new bill segment:

- **Cut-off Date is the last possible day of the bill segment's bill period. The current date defaults when the window opens.**
Refer to Ways To Control The End Date Of A Bill Segment for more information.

- **Accounting Date is used to define the financial period to which the new bill segment's financial transaction will be**
booked. The current date defaults when the window opens.

- Turn on Allow Estimatesto indicate if Oracle Utilities Meter Data Management should estimate consumption if it cannot
find a meter read.

- If the service agreement uses meter reads, use the Billing Option to control how the system retrieves meter reads that
appear on the bill. Choose Use Cut off Date if the meter reads must exist on the Cutoff Date (defined above). Choose
Use Schedule if you want the service agreement's service point(s) measurement cycle schedule to control the meter reads
that are used.

After specifying the above parameters, click the Calculate button to create a new bill segment for the bill.

If an error exists, refer to How To Correct A Bill Segment That's In Error.

If there are no errors, the Bill Segment Freeze Option on the installation option controls the next step:

- If this option is set to Freeze At Bill Completion, return to Bill - Main (using the bill context menu) and click the Freeze /
Complete button.

- If this option is set to Freeze At Will, click the Freeze button and, if everything looks clean, return to Bill - Main and
click the Complete button.

###### Delete (Bill Segment)

The Delete button deletes a bill segment.

This button is enabled if you are displaying a bill segment that is Incomplete, Error, or Freezable. Refer to Bill Segment
Lifecycle for more information about these status values.


-----

###### Freeze (Bill Segment)

Clicking the Freeze button causes a freezable bill segment to become frozen. Refer to Bill Segment Lifecycle for more
information about freezing.

This button is enabled if:

- the Freeze At Will Bill Segment Freeze Option on the installation option has been selected AND

- the bill segment is freezable.

**NOTE:**
**Freezing a day or more after generation. If the bill segment is linked to a closed accounting period, a pop-up appears**
in which you can specify a new accounting date. This will only happen if the accounting period closes before you freeze
the bill segment (the accounting date is stamped on a bill segment when it's initially generated).

**If problems are detected after freezing. A bill segment may not be changed after it is frozen. All subsequent changes**
must occur by canceling the frozen bill segment and creating a new bill segment. Refer to How To Cancel A Bill
Segment and How To Cancel / Rebill A Bill Segment for more information.

###### Rebill (Bill Segment)

If problems are detected with a frozen bill segment, it should be canceled and a new bill segment should be created. We
refer to this process as cancel / rebill. Refer to Cancel / Rebill Incorrect Bill Segments for more information.

Before you cancel / rebill, you'll probably need to fix the cause of the problem. The following table describes common
problems and where to go to fix them.

Problem How To Fix It

The wrong rate was used Go to Service Agreement - Rate Info and correct the rate.

The wrong meter was connected to the service point

A contract rider was applied incorrectly Go to Service Agreement - Rate Info and correct the contract rider

information.

The wrong tax exemption amount was calculated Go to Service Agreement - Rate Info and correct the tax exemption

information.

**NOTE:**
**Multi-Cancel/Rebill Saves Time. If the cause of the problem impacts many bill segments related to a service**
agreement, you should use the Multi Cancel Rebill transaction as it allows you to cancel / rebill an unlimited number of
bill segments at once. Also note that for service agreements that require bill determinants from Oracle Utilities Meter
Data Management, this transaction may only be used to cancel / rebill a single bill segment at a time.

**Credit Notes. Using the cancel/rebill functionality will cause the cancel and rebill details to be swept on to the**
customer's next bill unless you Reopen the bill. If your organization requires cancellation details to be presented to the
customer separately from the new bill, you should not use the Rebill functionality. Rather, you should issue a Credit
Note and then generate a new bill containing the revised charges.

The Rebill button causes an existing bill segment to be canceled, and a new bill segment to be created.


-----

This button is enabled when you display a Frozen bill segment AND the bill segment's bill is not written off AND the bill
segment's bill is not linked to an off cycle bill generator. Refer to Bill Segment Lifecycle for more information about these
status values.

When clicked, the Rebill window opens.

You must specify the following parameters to cancel and rebill a new bill segment:

- **Cancel Reason defines why the bill segment is being canceled.**

- **Cutoff Date is the last day of the new bill segment. The cutoff date on the bill segment defaults when the window opens.**

- **Accounting Date is used to define the financial period to which the canceled and new bill segments' financial**
transactions will be booked. The current date defaults when the window opens.

- Turn on Allow Estimatesto indicate if Oracle Utilities Meter Data Management should estimate consumption if it cannot
find a meter read.

- Use the Billing Option to define how the system looks for meter reads. Select Use Schedule if the system should select
reads based on the SA's SP's measurement cycle schedule. Select Use Cut off Date if the system should only select reads
from the end date of the existing bill segment.

- Turn on Use Old Read/Item/SQ for Regen if you want the system to use the consumption details on the original bill
segment when it calculates the new bill segment.

**NOTE:** The Use Old Read/Item/SQ switch is not available if the bill's SA references an SA type with a special role
flag of Bill Determinants Required.

Click the Calculate button to cancel the original bill segment and create a new bill segment.

At this point, there are now two bill segments - the original bill segment is in the state of Pending Cancel, the new bill
segment is in the Freezable (or Error ) state. If you want to back out, click the go to button to return to the original bill
segment and then click Undo (this will delete the new bill segment and return the original bill segment to the Frozen state).
If the new bill segment looks correct, click Freeze to move the original bill segment to the Canceled state and the new bill
segment to the Frozen state.

###### Init Cancel (Bill Segment)

The Init Cancel button causes the first step of the bill segment cancellation process to be executed. You'd click this button
if a frozen bill segment should never have been created (i.e., you want to remove the financial impact of a bill segment from
a customer's balance).

This button is enabled when you display a Frozen bill segment AND the bill segment's bill is not written off. Refer to Bill
Segment Lifecycle for more information about these status values.

When clicked, the Cancel window opens.

You must specify the following parameters to cancel and rebill a new bill segment:

- **Cancel Reason defines why the bill segment is being canceled.**

- **Accounting Date is used to define the financial period to which the canceled bill segment's financial transactions will be**
booked. The current date defaults when the window opens.

Click the Calculate button to cancel the original bill segment.

At this point, the bill segment is in the state of Pending Cancel. If you want to back out, click Undo; the bill segment will be
returned to the Frozen state. Click Cancel to move the bill segment to the Canceled state.

**NOTE:**
**Credit Notes. Using the cancel functionality will cause the cancel details to be swept on to the customer's next bill**
unless you Reopen the bill. If your organization requires cancellation details to be presented to the customer separately


-----

from the new bill, you should not use the cancel functionality. Rather, you should issue a Credit Note and then generate
a new bill containing the revised charges.

###### Undo (Bill Segment)

The Undo button returns a Pending Cancel bill segment to the Frozen state. If a Pending Cancel bill segment was created
during a Cancel / Rebill, the newly created Freezable bill segment is also deleted.

This button is enabled when you display a Pending Cancel bill segment. Refer to Bill Segment Lifecycle for more
information about this status.

###### Cancel (Bill Segment)

Clicking the Cancel button causes a Pending Cancel bill segment to become Canceled. Refer to Bill Segment Lifecycle for
more information about cancellation.

This button is enabled if a Pending Cancel bill segment is displayed AND the bill segment's bill is not written off.

When clicked, the Cancel window opens.

You must specify the following parameters to cancel the frozen bill segments:

- **Cancel Reason defines why you are performing the cancellation.**

- **Accounting Date defines the financial period to which the canceled bill segments' financial transactions will be booked.**
The current date defaults when the window opens.

After specifying the above parameters, click the Calculate button to cancel the frozen bill segments.

If the related bill is pending, the cancellation will cause the bill segment to be suppressed on the version of the bill sent to
the customer (but it remains in the database for audit and financial reporting purposes).

If the related bill is complete and you do not Reopen the bill, the financial impact of the canceled bill segment will appear
on the next bill created for the account (under Bill Corrections).

If the related bill is complete you may be able to Reopen the bill and then Complete it. By doing this, you can suppress
a frozen bill segment on a previously completed bill. This means that if you catch a problem after completion you don't
necessarily have to show the problem to the customer. Rather, cancel the problem, reopen and then recomplete the bill
(when you recomplete the bill the system will mark the bill segment to be suppressed on the version sent to the customer
because its cancellation appears on the same bill as the original charges).

###### Credit Note (Bill Segment)

The Credit Note button is used to cancel a bill segment and create a new bill that contains the cancellation details. We refer
to this "negative bill" as a credit note. Refer to Credit Notes - Presenting Cancellation Details on a Separate Bill for more
information.

**NOTE:**
**If you want to issue a credit note for an entire bill. Rather than cancel a specific bill segment, functionality exists that**
allows you to create a credit note for ALL bill segments on a bill. To use this feature, display the bill in question and
then click the Credit Note button on the bill page.

This button is enabled if:


-----

- the Use Credit Notes option on the Installation record is turned on AND

- the bill segment is frozen AND

- the bill segment's bill is not written off.

When clicked, the Credit Note window opens.

You must specify the following parameters to cancel the frozen bill segment:

- **Cancel Reason defines why you are performing the cancellation.**

- **Accounting Date defines the financial period to which the canceled bill segment's financial transaction will be booked.**
The current date defaults when the window opens.

- **Credit Note Date defines the date of the credit note on which the cancellation details will appear. The current date**
defaults when the window opens.

After specifying the above parameters, click the Calculate button to cancel the frozen bill segment and create a credit note.

It should be noted that if this operation is successful, the new "negative bill" will be complete (meaning that it will be ready
for transmission to the customer and for interface to the general ledger).

**Description of Page**

**Bill Seg Info is a concatenation of the bill segment's division, SA type, status, bill period and amount. Bill Segment ID is**
the system-assigned unique identifier of the bill segment.

The item details grid is a snapshot of the items that existed at the service agreement's service points at the time the bill
segment was created. One row exists for every type of item linked to every service point linked to the service agreement.

This information may be modified on a bill segment in the Error or Freezable state. Insert one row in the item grid (click
the + button) for each item you need to add. You may also change item amounts that were populated by the system when it
initially generated the bill by simply overwriting the information.

**WARNING:**


-----

The proper way to fix the number and type of items on a bill segment is to correct the service point / item information
and then regenerate the bill segment. Overriding the item details on a bill segment is a last resort that should only be
used when you cannot fix the service point / item information (for whatever reason).

The following information is displayed in the grid:

- **Seq No is the system-assigned unique identifier of the item detail row.**

- **Item Type is the type of item.**

- **Item ID is the unique identifier of the item (this is only displayed if a badged item is linked to the service point; non-**
badged items don't have unique identities).

- **Start Date is the first day in the bill segment's bill period that the item was linked to the service point.**

- **End Date is the last day in the bill segment's bill period that the item was linked to the service point.**

- **Item Count is the number of items of this type that were linked to the service agreement's service points.**

- If the item's item type indicates the system must estimate consumption (e.g., lamps), UOM is the unit of measure of the
estimated consumption. Daily Service Quantity is the item's estimated amount of daily consumption.

**Search and navigate to the Calc Lines page to view this information.**

**FASTPATH:**
Most service agreements use a rate to calculate the information that appears on this page. Refer to How Rates Affect The
Information On Bill Segments for more information.

**Description of Page**


-----

**Bill Seg Info is a concatenation of the bill segment's division, SA type, status, bill period and amount. Bill Segment ID is**
the system-assigned unique identifier of the bill segment.

The Bill Segment Header (Bill Seg Hdr) scroll contains one entry for every version of the rate that was used to calculate the
bill segment's lines. Because most bill segments use a single rate version calculation group, you typically only see one entry
in the scroll.

The following information is displayed above the bill calculation line grid.

- **Sequence will be 1 unless multiple versions of the rate were in effect during the bill period. If there was more than one**
effective rate version calculation group, there will be a separate set of calc lines for each version applied. The lines that
apply to the first part of the bill period would have a Sequence of 1, the lines for the next part of the bill period would
have a Sequence of 2 and so on.

- **Start Date - End Date is the portion of the bill segment period that the calculation details apply. .**

- **Amount is the sum of the bill calculation lines in the grid.**

- **Desc on Bill is summary information about the calculation details that will be printed on the customer's bill.**

- **Rate Version is the ID of the rate version calculation group and its effective date. This information only appears if a rate**
was used to calculate the charges.

The calculation lines grid is a snapshot of how the system calculated the bill segment amount. One row exists for every
calculation involved in this process. This information is for audit purposes only and may not be modified. The following
information is displayed in the grid:

- A drill down button appears in the Calc Line Char column if the bill calculation line has characteristics. The Calc Line
**Char column only appears if at least one of the calculation lines has a characteristic.**

- **Sequence is the system-assigned unique identifier of the calculation detail row.**

- **Description on Bill is the information about the bill line that appears on the customer's bill.**

- **Calculated Amount is the calculated amount associated with the bill line.**

- The Print switch controls whether information about this line will print on the customer's bill.

- The Appears in Summary switch defines if this line's amount also appears on a summary line. This switch plays a
part at bill print time - those lines that appear in a summary print in the left dollar column, those that don't appear in a
summary print in the right dollar column.

The system automatically populates this switch as follows:

- Bill segments created by applying a rate have this switch turned on if the corresponding calculation rule is summarized
on a summary calculation rule

- Bill segments created from billable charges use the value of this switch as defined on the billable charge. Refer to
Maintaining Billable Charges for more information.

- **Unit of Measure (UOM) is the unit of measure of the service quantity priced on the calculation line.**

- **Time of Use (TOU) is the time-of-use code of the service quantity priced on the calculation line.**

- **SQI is the service quantity identifier of the service quantity priced on the calculation line.**

- **Billable Service Quantity is the service quantity priced on the calculation line. This quantity will be different from the**
measured consumption is there are pre-processing calculation group in effect.

- **Base Amount is used by calculation lines (e.g. taxes) that are cross-referenced to other calculation lines and whose**
value(s), therefore, depend on the amounts calculated by those other lines. The Base Amount shows the total amount
derived from the cross-referenced line(s) that the current line then used to calculate its billed amount.

- **Calculation Rule is the rule that calculated the line. This is only populated if the new rate engine calculated the charges.**

- **Measures Peak Qty is checked if the UOM priced on the calculation line is used to measure a peak quantity.**


-----

- **Exempt Amount is the amount of the calculated charge that the customer doesn't have to pay because they are tax**
exempt.

- **Distribution Code is the distribution code associated with the calculation line. This distribution code is used to build the**
general ledger details on the bill segment's financial transaction.

- **Description describes the characteristic value that was used when the line's amount was calculated. This information is**
only displayed if the line was calculated using a bill factor (because only bill factors use characteristic values). Refer to
An Illustration Of A Bill Factor And Its Characteristics for more information.

the system-assigned unique identifier of the bill segment.

The Bill Segment FT scroll contains one entry for every financial transaction (FT) associated with the bill segment. All bill
segments have an FT that shows the impact of the bill segment on the general ledger. A bill segment may have an additional
FT (for a maximum of two) if it is cancelled. The second FT shows the impact of the cancellation on the general ledger.

The following financial transaction information is displayed above the general ledger distribution grid.

- **FT Type displays the type of financial transaction (FT).**

- **Show on bill indicates if information about the FT appears on the customer's bill.**

- **FT ID is the system-assigned unique identifier of the FT. Click the go to button to transfer to the Financial Transaction**

  - Main page. On this page you can change certain aspects of the FT in question. Refer to How To Remove Unwanted
Adjustments (or Payments) From A Completed Bill for a description of how to perform common maintenance functions.

- The posted by information that appears adjacent to the FT ID shows the date on which the FT was frozen and the user ID
of the user who performed the operation.

- The "Linked to bill on" message appears when the financial transaction is linked to a bill. A FT is linked to a bill the
next time a bill is completed for the account. Therefore, if a user cancels a bill segment, the FT associated with the
cancellation will not be linked to a bill until the next bill is completed (although the financial effect of the cancellation
takes place immediately). Click the adjacent go to button to transfer to the bill on which the FT appears.

- **Current Amount contains the FT's effect on the service agreement's current balance.**

- **Payoff Amount contains the FT's effect on the service agreement's payoff balance. This field is only visible when the**
payoff amount differs from the current amount.

- **Accounting Date is the date the system uses to determine the FT's accounting period in your general ledger.**

- **Arrears Date is the date the FT starts aging.**

The journal details grid is a snapshot of the distribution codes used to generate the GL accounts that are affected by the FT.
This information is for audit purposes only and may not be modified. The following information is displayed in the grid:

- **Seq is the system-assigned unique identifier of the distribution line.**

- **Distribution Code is the distribution code used to generate the GL account affected by the distribution line. Drill over to**
the FT if you need to see the actual GL account.

- **Amount is the amount debited / credited (credits are shown as negative values).**

- **Statistics and Statistics Amount are only specified when a statistical quantity is associated with the distribution line.**
For example, if the line is associated with a charge for the total number of kilowatt-hours consumed, the statistics code
will be the kWh and the statistics amount will be the number of kilowatt-hours associated with the charge.

- **Description describes the characteristic value that was used when the line's amount was calculated. This information**
is only displayed if the distribution line was derived from bill calculation lines that were calculated using a bill factor
(because only bill factor's use characteristic values). Refer to An Illustration Of A Bill Factor And Its Characteristics for
more information.

###### Off Cycle Bill Generator Log

An off cycle bill generator log contains an entry for every recorded event during the lifecycle of the off cycle bill generator.
There are two general types of log entries:

- **Automatic entries. The system automatically creates an entry in the log when an off cycle bill generator is created or**
there is a status change or when a related entity is created. This also includes any implementation-specific log entries.
Users cannot modify or delete these log entries.

- **Manual entries. Users can add manual entries to record significant events at their discretion.**

##### Multi Cancel/Rebill

The Multi-Cancel/Rebill transaction is used to cancel / rebill (and freeze) one or more bill segments linked to a service
agreement.

**NOTE:**
You would typically use this transaction when something has been wrong for an extended period of time. For example,
if the customer was assigned the wrong rate when they first started service, you would correct the customer's rate using
Service Agreement - Rate Info and then use this transaction to cancel / rebill the customer's historical bill segments.

The following topics describe how to use this transaction.

###### Multi Cancel/Rebill - Main

The main page is used to select the bill segments to be cancel/rebilled and to initiate the cancel/rebill request. Open Menu >
**Financial > Multi-Cancel/Rebill to use this function.**

**Description of Page**


-----

This page contains all non-cancelled bill segments associated with a given SA ID. The service agreement's SA Info,
**Account ID (and name), characteristic Premise (and address), Current Balance and Payoff Balance are displayed at the**
top of page.

When the page first opens, the grid is populated with ALL non-cancelled bill segments displayed in reverse chronology
order. All frozen bill segments are pre-selected for cancel/rebill processing. The following information appears in the grid:

- Selected Switch. If this switch is turned on, the bill segment will be cancel / rebilled when the Cancel/Rebill/Freeze
button is clicked. You can use the mouse to toggle the value of this switch on a specific bill segment. Alternatively, you
can click the Select All button or Clear All button to toggle the switch for all frozen bill segments. The checkbox is
disabled if the bill segment's bill is written off. Note: the total number of selected bill segments is shown above the grid
for confirmation purposes.

- **Start Date. This is the first day of the bill segment.**

- **End Date. This is the last day of the bill segment.**

- **Create Date/Time. This is the day/time the bill segment was created.**

- **Amount. This is the payoff amount of the bill segment.**

- **Original Amount. This column only contains a value if the bill segment is a rebill of another bill segment. In this**
situation, one of the following values will be displayed:

- If the amount of the new bill segment differs from the amount of the original bill segment, the amount of the original bill
segment will be displayed.

- If the amount of the new bill segment equals the amount of the original bill segment, the word No change will be
displayed.

- **Bill Segment Information. This is the standard bill segment summary information.**

**NOTE:**
**Sorting By Values In The Grid. Just like all grids in the system, you can click on a column heading to resort the grid**
by the value of the respective column. This might be useful to sort the bill segments in Amount order.

After selecting the bill segments to be cancel/rebilled, click the Cancel/Rebill/Freeze button. When this button is clicked,
an additional informational page displays. Specify the following information and then click Calculate to cancel the selected
bill segment and create new bill segments:

- **Cancel Reason defines why the bill segment(s) are being canceled.**

- **Accounting Date is used to define the financial period to which the canceled and new bill segments' financial**
transactions will be booked.

- Turn on Allow Estimates to indicate if Oracle Utilities Meter Data Management should estimate consumption if it
cannot find a meter read.

- Use the Billing Option to define how the system looks for meter reads:

  - Select Use Schedule if the system should select reads based on the SA's SP's measurement cycle schedule.

  - Select Use Cut off Date if the system should only select reads from the end date of the existing bill segment.

- Select Use Schedule if the system should select reads based on the SA's SP's measurement cycle schedule.

- Select Use Cut off Date if the system should only select reads from the end date of the existing bill segment.

- If you'd prefer to have the system use the consumption details snapshot on the original bill segments, turn on Use Old
**Read/Item/SQ. If this switch is on then neither Allow Estimates nor Billing Option is relevant.**

**NOTE:** The Use Old Read/Item/SQ switch is not available if the bill's SA references an SA type with a special role
flag of Bill Determinants Required.


-----

**WARNING:**
If the cause of the rebill is an incorrect rate and the new rate requires service quantities that were not calculated when the
bill was originally calculated, do not turn on Use Old Read/Item/SQ. Why? Because you want the system to derive new
service quantities during the rebill process.

**NOTE:**
**Default note. The Accounting Date is defaulted to the current date and the Use Old Read/Item/SQ switch is turned on.**

After specifying the above information, the system cancel / rebills each segment in chronological order (i.e., earlier
segments will be cancel / rebilled before later segments). The new amount of each bill segment is shown in the Original
**Amount column. You can navigate to the Graph page to graphically view the financial ramifications of the cancel/rebills.**

**NOTE:**
**Errors. It's possible that bill segment errors will occur when you cancel / rebill the bill segments. For example, if you**
change the SA's rate to a rate that requires a unit-of-measure that doesn't exist on the SA's meter, a bill segment error
will be generated. If this occurs, you must go to Bill Segment - Main for the pending cancel bill segment and use the
**Undo action to remove the offending bill segment (and restore the original segment to the Frozen state). Alternatively,**
you can drill down on the Error bill segment and use the Regenerate action after correcting the cause of the problem.

**There is no Undo. Unlike cancel / rebills performed on Bill Segment - Main, there is no Undo action. This is because**
the multi-cancel/rebill transaction freezes the newly created bill segments after it cancel/rebills; whereas the bill segment
transaction lets you examine the new bill segment before you freeze it. If you made a mistake, simply correct the cause
of the mistake and then cancel / rebill again. The erroneous financial transactions will be automatically suppressed on
the next bill produced for the customer.

###### Multi Cancel/Rebill - Graph

This page contains a graph that shows the rebilled and original payoff amounts for a service agreement's non-cancelled bill
segments. Open Menu > Financial > Multi Cancel/Rebill and navigate to the Graph page to view this information.

##### Bill Exception

If errors are detected during the billing process, it may cause a record to be written to the bill exception table with a message
indicating the nature of the severe error.

To view the messages associated with the exception records, schedule the TD-BIERR background process. This process
generates a To Do entry for every record in the bill exception table.

**FASTPATH:**
Refer to How to Correct a Bill That's In Error for instructions describing how to correct a bill.

##### Bill Segment Exception

If errors are detected during the billing process, it may cause a record to be written to the bill segment exception table with a
message indicating the nature of the severe error.

To view the messages associated with the exception records, schedule the TD-BSERR background process. This process
generates a To Do entry for every record in the bill segment exception table.

**FASTPATH:**
Refer to How To Correct A Bill Segment That's In Error for instructions describing how to correct a bill segment.

##### Maintaining Billable Charges

You create a billable charge whenever a customer should be charged for a service that occurs outside the normal course of
business. For example, you would create a billable charge to charge a contractor for the repair of a ruptured gas line.

**NOTE:**
**Billable charges can be uploaded from an external system. Refer to Uploading Billable Charges and Using Billable**
Charges For Pass Through Billing for more information.


-----

A billable charge must refer to a service agreement. This service agreement behaves just like any other service agreement:

- **Bill segments are created for the service agreement. Whenever billing is performed for an account with billable**
charge service agreements, the system creates a bill segment for each billable charge. This means that if a service
agreement has many unbilled billable charges, it will have many bill segments.

- **Payments are distributed to the service agreement. Payments made by an account are distributed to its billable charge**
service agreements just like any other service agreement.

- **Overdue debt is monitored. The credit and collections process monitors billable charge service agreements for overdue**
debt and responds accordingly when overdue debt is detected.

- This service agreement must reference an SA Type that has a Special Role of Billable Charge. If such a service
agreement does not already exist for the account, one must be created before you can levy a billable charge. See "For
more information" at the end of this section for links to other sections that will help you with this process.

Billable charge templates exist to minimize the effort required to create a billable charge for a customer. A billable charge
template contains the standard bill lines, amounts and distribution codes used to charge for a one-off charge.

A user may override the information on the template when the billable charge is created. For example, you can create a
billable charge template to levy charges when a contractor ruptures a gas main. This template would contain the bill lines,
amounts and distribution codes associated with a ruptured pipe repair. Then, when a contractor ruptures a line, a user can
create a billable charge using the template and override the amount to reflect the actual repair amount (if it differs from the
norm).

**NOTE:**
**Templates aren't required. A billable charge can be created without a template for a truly unexpected charge. If you**
don't use a template, you'll have to enter the bill information manually.

**FASTPATH:**
Refer to Setting Up Billable Charge Templates for more information.

**NOTE:**
**Adding taxes and other calculation lines to a billable charge. Refer to Billable Charge - SQ Details for information**
about how to have the system calculate tax lines and append them to the billable charge.

###### Billable Charge - Main

Open Menu > Financial > Billable Charge > Search to maintain a billable charge.

**Description of Page**

The Billable Charge ID is system generated. The Account ID of the account responsible for the charge is displayed at the
top.

Use SA ID to define the ID of the billable charge service agreement that will hold the billable charge's debt. The Account
**ID for the service agreement is displayed for information purposes.**

Use Start Date and End Date to define the charge's bill period.

**NOTE:**
**Installment billable charges. You can create many future dated billable charges to implement unusual installment**
plans. For example, if you want to bill a customer $250 today, $150 next month, and $1000 three months from now; you


-----

could create three billable charges with a date that reflects the earliest bill date. When a bill is produced for the account,
the system will create a bill segment for every billable charge whose start date is on or before the current date.

If you want to create the billable charges from an existing template, enter the ID of the Billable Charge Template from
which the billable charge information defaults. If your SA Type indicates a billable charge template, that value will be
defaulted. The billable charge template is stored with the billable charge, to reference what was used to create it.

**NOTE:** Actual billable charge lines can differ from what was originally defaulted from the billable charge template if
user overrides were done after defaulting. Refer to Maintaining Billable Charges for more details.

Use Description on Bill to define the verbiage that should print on the customer's bill above the line item details.

**Billable Charge Status defines the state of the billable charges. Possible values are Billable and Cancelled. Click the**
**Cancel button to cancel a billable charge.**

**Bill Segment ID is the ID of the bill segment on which the billable charge's charge details appear. This information is only**
populated AFTER the billable charge has been swept onto a bill.

The Total Bill Amount displays the sum of all billable charge lines except those that are Memo Only. The Total Line
**Amount displays the sum of all billable charge lines except those that Appear In Summary.**

The information in the scroll defines the line item details associated with the billable charge. Click the drill down button to
navigate to the line characteristics. The following fields are required for each line:

**Sequence Sequence controls the order in which the line items appear on the bill segment.**

**Description on Bill Specify the verbiage to print on the bill for the line item.**

**Charge Amount Specify the amount to charge for the line item.**

**Show on Bill Turn this switch on if the line item should appear on the customer's printed bill. It would be very unusual for**
this switch to be off.

**Appears in Summary Turn this switch on when the amount associated with this line also appears in a summary line. This**
switch plays a part at bill print time - those lines that appear in a summary print in the left dollar column, those that don't
appear in a summary print in the right dollar column. Also note, those lines that appear in a summary line are not included
in the total amount associated with the billable charge.

**Memo Only, No GL Turn this switch on if the billable charge line does not contribute to the total amount due (e.g., this**
switch would be on for "information only" lines).

**Distribution Code Specify the distribution code that identifies the GL account associated with this line item. The**
description of the code appears adjacent.

about billable charge templates, refer to Setting Up Billable Charge Templates.

###### Billable Charge - Line Characteristics

Characteristics may be associated with billable charge lines. Typically, this is done to categorize billable charge lines for
reporting purposes.

Open Menu > Financial > Billable Charge > Search and navigate to the Line Characteristics page to maintain
characteristics that are associated with billable charge.

**Description of Page**

The Billable Charge Line scroll defines the billable charge line to which you wish to assign characteristic values. The
following fields display:


-----

**Characteristic Type The type of characteristic.**

**Characteristics Value The value of the characteristic.**

**NOTE:**
You can only choose characteristic types defined as permissible on a billable charge line. Refer to Setting Up
Characteristic Types & Their Values for more information.

###### Billable Charge - SQ Details

Optionally, you may specify service quantities associated with a billable charge. These are most commonly used when you
want the system to calculate charges in addition to the billable charge lines (e.g., adding tax to the billable charge lines).

**NOTE:**
**The SA must specify a rate. If you want the system to calculate additional charges based on the service quantities**
defined on this page, the related billable charge service agreement must reference a rate. This rate must have calculation
rules that calculate charges based on the service quantities specified on this page. When the service agreement is next
billed, the system will sweep on the billable charges and then call the rate and pass it the service quantities defined on
this page. The rate will calculate the additional charges and these will be appended to the bill segment.

Open Menu > Financial > Billable Charge > Search and navigate to the SQ Details page to maintain a billable charges
service quantities.

**Description of Page**

The following fields display:

**Sequence Specify the sequence number of the SQ.**

**UOM Select the unit of measure of this SQ. One or more of UOM, TOU, or SQ Identifier must be selected.**

**TOU Select the time of use period.**

**SQ Identifier Select the SQ identifier.**

**Service Quantity Specify the number of units of this service quantity.**

###### Billable Charge - Read Details

Optionally, you may specify meter read details associated with a billable charge. These are most commonly used when you
need to print the read details that were used to calculate the bill lines that appear on the main tab.

**NOTE:**
**Using these reads to derive billable consumption. The base package bill segment creation algorithm (BSBC-BC)**
simply sweeps billable charge read details onto the related bill segment as calculation / audit reads. This algorithm does
NOT use these reads to derive billable consumption. This is intentional as most implementations that import reads also
import billable consumption and therefore deriving billable consumption is unnecessary (and also error prone). If your
implementation needs to derive billable consumption from these reads, you can develop your own bill segment creation
algorithm to do just this.

Open Menu > Financial > Billable Charge > Search and navigate to the Read Details page to maintain a billable
charges service quantities.

**Description of Page**


-----

The grid is a snapshot of the meter reads whose consumption was billed using the bill lines shown on the main tab. One row
exists for every read that should be swept onto the related bill segment as a calculation / audit read when the system creates
a bill segment for this billable charge. The following information is displayed in the grid:

- **Final Unit of Measure is the unit of measure of the resultant billing quantity.**

- **Final Time of Use is the time-of-use code of the resultant billing quantity.**

- **Final Service Quantity Identifier is the service quantity identifier of the resultant billing quantity.**

- **Register Quantity is the resultant billing quantity.**

- **How To Use (SP) is the SA/SP's how to use code.**

- **Service Point ID is the unique identifier of the service point at which the meter was located.**

- **Meter Configuration ID is the unique identifier of the meter's configuration.**

- **Sequence is the sequence number of the register on the meter.**

- **Unit of Measure is the register's unit of measure.**

- **Time of Use is the register's time-of-use code.**

- **SQI is reserved for future use.**

- **Start Register Reading is the start register reading.**

- **End Register Reading is the end register reading.**

- **Measured Quantity is the resulting measured quantity.**

- **Register Constant is the constant on the register that is multiplied by the measured quantity to derive the register's**
billable consumption.

- **How To Use is the register's how to use code.**

- **Use Percent is the SA/SP's usage percentage. A value of 100% is defaulted.**

- **Measures Peak Qty indicates if the unit of measure is one that measures peak consumption.**

- **Start Read Date/Time is the date and time of the start meter read. If the register is consumptive, (as opposed to**
subtractive) nothing will be displayed.

- **End Read Date/Time is the date and time of the end meter read.**

- **Start Reg Read ID is the unique identifier of the start register read. If the register is consumptive, (as opposed to**
subtractive) nothing will be displayed.

- **Read Type is the read type of the start meter read.**

- **End Reg Read ID is the unique identifier of the end register read.**

- **Read Type is the read type of the end meter read.**

- **Multiplier is the composite multiplier that converts the measured quantity to the registered quantity.**

**NOTE:**
The multiplier is calculated by dividing the Register Quantity by the Measured Quantity (if the Measured Quantity is 0,
then the result is 0). This is not stored on the database. There is a chance that the value is not precise due to round-off.

##### Uploading Billable Charges

###### BCU1 - Validate & Populate Billable Charge Upload Staging

This process has several functions:

- It populates the SA ID on all BC upload staging records where SA ID is left blank. This means that you don't have to
know the SA ID in order to interface a billable charge into the system. The program populates SA ID with the service
agreement related to the SA relationship with the most recent effective date for a given combination of service provider's
external system ID and customer's ID in the sender's system. The system can only do this if the following points are true:

- You use the system's SA relationship functionality to define that you provide bill ready billing services for a service
provider. On the customer's SA relationship record you must define the customer's ID in the service provider's system.
Refer to Maintaining SA Relationships for more information.

- You identify the service provider's external system ID on the billable charge upload staging record.

- You identify the customer's ID in the sender's system.

**NOTE:**
You can still interface billable charges if you don't use the system's SA relationship functionality. How? You simply
need to derive the SA ID associated with the uploaded billable charge.

- It populates various fields (e.g., the GL distribution code, memo only switch) on the billable charge upload line records
from the billable charge line type specified on each respective record.

Any validation / population errors detected during this process are written to the BC Upload Exception table. You can fix
errors using BC Upload Staging page (don't forget to change the record's status back to Pending ).


-----

###### BCU2 - Create Billable Charge

This process creates a billable charge and billable charge lines (shown in the yellow section of the following ERD) for all
BC upload records in the Pending state.

If the billable charge's SA is Closed, it will Reactivate it so that the billable charges will be swept onto the next bill
produced for the account.

**NOTE:**
This process will override the values of the various switches referenced on billable charge upload staging line if the
respective service agreement's SA type has an override value for the line's billable charge line type. Refer to SA Type Billable Charge Overrides for more information.

Any errors detected during this process are written to the Billable Charge Upload Exception table. You can fix errors using
BC Upload Staging page (don't forget to change the record's status back to Pending ).

###### BCUP-PRG - Purge Billable Charge Upload Objects

Completed billable charge upload staging objects should be periodically purged from the system by executing the BCUPPRG background process. This background process allows you to purge all Completed billable charge upload staging
objects older than a given number of days.

We want to stress that there is no system constraint as to the number of Completed billable charge upload objects that
may exist. You can retain these objects for as long as you desire. However we recommend that you periodically purge
Completed billable charge upload objects as they exist only to satisfy auditing and reporting needs.

###### Billable Charge Upload Staging

The Billable charge Upload Staging page has three purposes:

- You can view historical billable charge upload records.

- You can correct billable charge upload records that are in error.

- You can add new billable charge upload records. These will be uploaded by the billable charge upload process (although
it's probably easier to just add the billable charges using the Maintaining Billable Charges page).

The topics in the section describe how to maintain this information.

Optionally, you may specify meter read details associated with a billable charge. These are most commonly used when you
need to print the read details that were used to calculate the bill lines that appear on the main tab.

**NOTE:**
**Using these reads to derive billable consumption. The base package bill segment creation algorithm (BSBS-BC)**
simply sweeps billable charge read details onto the related bill segment's read detail. This algorithm does NOT use these
reads to derive billable consumption. This is intentional as most implementations that import reads also import billable
consumption and therefore deriving billable consumption is unnecessary (and also error prone). If your implementation
needs to derive billable consumption from these reads, you can develop your own bill segment creation algorithm to do
just this.

##### The Big Picture of Payments

A payment reduces how much an account owes. The topics in this section provide background information about a variety
of payment topics.

###### A Payment Event Has Payments And Tenders

The explanation in The Financial Big Picture provides an accurate, but incomplete view of payments. The missing pieces
concern payment events and tenders. The following diagram illustrates the difference between a payment event, its
payment(s) and its tender(s).

The following concepts are illustrated above:

**A payment event defines the event A payment event is required whenever any form of payment is received. The payment**
event defines the payment date (and that's all).

**A payment event has tender(s) A tender exists for every form of tender remitted as part of the payment event. A payment**
event must have at least one tender otherwise nothing was remitted. A payment event may have many tenders when
multiple payment methods are associated with an event (e.g., paying with cash, a check, and a credit card).

**A payment is allocated to account(s) The total amount of tenders under a payment event is distributed to one or more**
accounts.

**A payment is distributed to SAs The system allocates an account's payment amount amongst its service agreements. The**
system creates a payment segment for each service agreement that receives a portion of the payment.


-----

**Payor and payee are frequently the same The account remitting the tender (the payor) is frequently the same as the**
account to which the funds are allocated (the payee). The next illustration provides an example when this is not the case.

###### Multiple Tenders Used To Pay For Multiple Accounts

The following diagram illustrates a payment event with multiple tenders where the payor of the tender is not the same as the
account(s) receiving the payment.

**A payment event may have many tenders A single payment event may have many tenders. While the above example**
shows both tenders being paid by the same account, each tender may reference a different account.

**Many accounts may be paid under 1 event The total amount of tenders under a payment event are distributed to one or**
more accounts.

**Payor may differ from payee The account(s) remitting the tender may differ from the account(s) whose debt is relieved.**

###### An Overview Of The Payment Event Creation & Allocation Process


-----

When a payment event occurs, the system stores a tender for each form of remittance (e.g., cash, check, charge). It then
allocates the sum of the tenders to one or more accounts.

By default, the system allocates the sum of the tenders to the account that remits the tenders. You may override this default
and specify any number of accounts and their respective payment allocation amount. This is useful, for example, when a
social service agency pays for many accounts. If applicable, you may also configure the system to use your own payment
event distribution rule(s).

**FASTPATH:**
Refer to Distributing A Payment Event for more information.

The system distributes a payment amongst an account's service agreements based on the age of each service agreement's
debt AND distribution priority. The system creates a payment segment for each service agreement that receives part of the
payment.

**FASTPATH:**
Refer to Distributing A Payment Amongst An Account's Service Agreements for more information.

You may manually redistribute the payment amount amongst the account's service agreements before you commit the
distribution. When the distribution is acceptable, you freeze the payment. Freezing a payment causes the system to create a
financial transaction for each related payment segment. It is the financial transaction(s) that causes the service agreements'
payoff and current balances to be reduced. The financial transaction also contains the journal details that debit "cash" and
credit some other GL account.

And that's it. The remaining topics in this section provide more information about the creation and allocation of payment
events.

**NOTE:**
**Batch and real-time payment event creation / allocation. There is only one payment event creation / allocation**
routine and therefore anything the batch payment process does for whole batches of payments, you can do to a payment
on-line.

###### Distributing A Payment Event

**WARNING:**
This section deals with the concept distributing a payment amount into payment(s). It does not discuss the distribution
of a single payment into segments. For more information about payment distribution, refer to Distributing A Payment
Amongst An Account's Service Agreements.

The base-package, by default, creates a single payment for a payment event. Some business practices require potentially
many payments to be created when payment events are added.

A few examples of when multiple payments may be necessary are:

- A payment amount needs to be distributed towards different distribution types:

  - $50 in interest

  - $60 in collection charges

  - $70 in taxes

- Each of the above distributions is realized as a separate payment identified by its own match type (i.e., there'll be one
match type called Interest, another called Collection Charges, etc.).


-----

In this example, the debt of a single service agreement may be relieved by each of these payments.

- In a similar way, you may want to create a separate payment for an overpayment to differentiate it from regular payments
(using yet another match type).

- In the case of a social service agency that pays for many accounts, a single payment event may be distributed amongst
multiple accounts.

The method by which a payment amount is distributed to create payment(s) is contained in Create Payment algorithms
plugged in on a distribution rule.

There is yet another aspect to having control over how payment events are created. The default method of creating payment
events assumes knowledge of account IDs (of the payor and the payee) when making a payment. In cases where payments
are made by and towards business entities other than accounts, knowledge of their corresponding account IDs may not be
available at payment time. Consider the following examples:

- A payment is made to pay a person's bill, providing the person's identification at payment time.

- A payment is made towards a specific service agreement using a "contract number" defined as SA characteristic.

The method by which the tender account is determined by means of an alternate identifier is contained in Determine Tender
Account algorithm plugged in on a distribution rule.

**FASTPATH:**
Refer to Making Payments Using Distribution Rules for information on how to configure your system to use this
distribution method.

###### Distributing A Payment Amongst An Account's Service Agreements

**WARNING:**
This section deals with the concept of distributing a payment amongst an account's service agreements. It does not
discuss how the sum of a payment event's tenders is balanced out by payment allocations. For more information about
payment event balance, refer to Unbalanced Payment Events.

A payment must be distributed to one or more service agreements for its financial impact to be realized. When a payment
satisfies an account's entire debt, you don't have to worry about how the system distributes the payment. The concept of
payment distribution is only relevant when a partial or excess payment is distributed.

The first important point to understand is that the method of distributing a payment amongst an account's service
agreements is contained in an algorithm that's plugged in on to Customer Class. This means that you can have different
distribution algorithms for different customer classes.

**NOTE:**
**Manual overrides. Most of the time, you'll let the payment distribution algorithm distribute the payment amongst an**
account's service agreements. However, you may manually distribute a payment when a customer directs a payment to
specific service agreement(s).

The following explanation describes one of the base package payment distribution algorithms (refer to Payment Distribution

- Pay Priority and Debt Age (PYDIST-PPRTY) for information about this algorithm). This algorithm distributes a payment
based on:

- The age of each service agreement's debt.

- The payment distribution priority of each service agreement's SA type.

The following diagram helps illustrate how the distribution algorithm works.


-----

The above example shows three columns, one for each service agreement linked to a hypothetical account. Notice that
two of the service agreements have the same distribution priority, the third has a lower priority. The numbers in the cells
indicate the order in which the system distributes a partial payment.

**NOTE:**
**Debt terminology. Before we can discuss the distribution algorithm, you must understand the terminology we use to**
categorize debt. Delinquent debt is associated with financial transactions that appear on overdue bills. Non-delinquent
debt is associated with financial transactions that appear on current bills. New debits debt is associated with financial
transactions that do not yet appear on a completed bill (e.g., a late payment charge that hasn't been billed yet).

The following points describe the algorithm used to distribute the partial payment:

- The system pays off delinquent debt of the highest priority service agreements first. In the above example, where
multiple service agreements have the same distribution priority, the system does NOT payoff one service agreement
before it starts on the next (which one would it pick?). Rather, it distributes the payment amongst the service agreements
based on the age of the respective debt on each service agreement. In the above example, this is represented by steps 1
through 6 (notice how the distribution jumps between SA1 and SA2).

- After all delinquent debt has been relieved from the highest priority service agreement(s), the system pays off the next
priority until all delinquent debt is relieved. In the above example, this is represented by steps 7 through 9.

- The system next pays off non-delinquent debt using each service agreement's respective distribution priority. Note well,
the payment distribution algorithm doesn't associate an age with non-delinquent debt and therefore the distribution is


-----

based purely on the service agreements' respective distribution priority. In the above example, this is represented by steps
10 through 12.

- After all non-delinquent debt is relieved, the system next pays off "new debit" debt based on the service agreements'
respective distribution priority. In the above example, this is represented by steps 13 through 15.

- Refer to Overpayment for a description of what happens if money still exists after the above distribution is complete.

**NOTE:**
**Payment segments and financial transactions. A payment segment exists for each service agreement that receives**
a portion of a payment. Linked to each payment segment is a financial transaction. It is the financial transaction that
causes the service agreement's debt to be relieved and the general ledger to be impacted.

**FASTPATH:**
Refer to Payment Exception for more information about how the system handles errors detected during the payment
distribution process.

**NOTE:**
**Overriding the distribution algorithm for uploaded payments. The standard distribution algorithm is used for**
payments that are Interfaced From An External System unless you specify a MATCH_VALUE and MATCH_FLG on
the Payment Staging row associated with the uploaded payment. These fields are used in conjunction to indicate that the
distribution of the payment should be restricted in some way (i.e., the standard payment distribution algorithm should
not be used). MATCH_FLG indicates how the payment should be distributed (e.g., only distribute to a specific service
agreement), MATCH_VALUE contains the ID of the restriction (e.g., the SA ID).

**Open item customers. For an open-item customer, you MUST override the standard distribution algorithm because**
the payment is distributed as per the open items that it is relieving. Refer to Payments And Match Events for more
information.

###### Overpayment

Overpayment refers to the situation where money is left over after a payment has been distributed to all eligible service
agreements, and all debt is relieved. Refer to Overpayment Segmentation for a description on how to configure the system
to handle your overpayment requirements.

###### Canceling A Tender Versus Canceling A Payment

A payment event has tender(s) and payment(s). You can cancel a tender when it's not valid, e.g., when a check bounces.
You can cancel a payment when the account should not have received the payment (e.g., a misdistribution or a canceled
tender).

When you cancel a tender, the system automatically cancels ALL frozen payments. We do this because if the tender
is canceled, there are no funds to distribute to accounts (unless there are other non-canceled tenders under the event).
However, when you cancel a payment, the system does NOT cancel the tender(s) because we assume that, if the tenders
were incorrect, you would have canceled them rather than the payment.

###### NSF Cancellations


-----

When a tender is canceled, a cancellation reason must be supplied. If the cancellation reason indicates a NSF (non sufficient
funds) charge should be levied, the system invokes the NSF charge algorithm specified on the tender's account's customer
class. Algorithms of this type will typically create an adjustment or billable charge to levy the NSF charge. Refer to NSFCDFLT for an example of such an algorithm.

**NOTE:**
**The payor gets the NSF adjustments. It's possible for the payor of a tender to differ from the payee (e.g., when a social**
service agency pays for other customers' debt). When you cancel a tender you must specify a cancellation reason. If the
cancellation reason indicates an NSF charge should be levied, the sample algorithm provided with the system levies the
NSF charge on the PAYOR's account. Because adjustments must be linked to a service agreement, the algorithm picks
the payor's service agreement with the highest payment distribution priority and levies the adjustment specified in the
service agreement's SA type's NSF adjustment type.

Besides calling this algorithm, a NSF cancellation may affect the tendering account's credit rating and cash-only score. The
cancellation reason indicates the extent to which the account's ratings are affected.

And finally, whenever a tender is canceled due to non-sufficient funds, the account is scheduled for review by the Account
Debt Monitor.

###### Transferring A Payment

If the account on an event's tender and payment are wrong, you can use the Transfer button on the Payment Event page to
transfer the payment to another account.

If the account on the payment is wrong - but the tender is correct, you can use the Transfer button on the Payment page to
transfer the payment only to another account.

###### Unbalanced Payment Events

The system, by default, distributes the sum of a payment event's tenders to the account that remits the tender with a single
payment. After distribution the sum of the tenders equals the sum of the payments when the event is first created. We refer
to such an event as being balanced.

However, it is possible for an event's tender amount to not equal the sum of the payment allocations (i.e., the event becomes
unbalanced ). How? Well, there are several ways this can happen:

- While the system DEFAULTS the payment amount to be the tender amount, you can override the payment amount and
therefore make a previously balanced event unbalanced.

- While the system DEFAULTS the payment account to be the tender account, you can add additional accounts / amounts
and therefore make a previously balanced event unbalanced.

- When you cancel a tender (e.g., because a check bounces), the system cancels ALL payments linked to the tenders
payment event. If the payment event has multiple tenders, this will cause the event to become unbalanced. To correct this
situation, you must add payment allocations to equal the amount of uncanceled tenders.

- If you cancel a payment and forget to add another payment for the same amount, the event becomes unbalanced. To
correct this situation, you must add another payment (or cancel the tender).

- You may delete a tender from an event while its tender control is open. If you delete a tender and don't do anything about
the related payments, the event becomes unbalanced.

- You may add a tender to an event at any time. If you don't allocate the tender amount to an account, the event becomes
unbalanced.

**FASTPATH:**
Refer to Payment Event Exception for more information about how the system reminds you about unbalanced payment
events.

###### How And When Payments Appear On Bills

**FASTPATH:**
Refer to Financial Transactions Created Between Bills for more information.

###### Tender Management and Workstation Cashiering

When you add a tender, you must identify its Tender Source. For example,

- A specific cash drawer ID is the source of tenders remitted to a cashier.

- The notional lockbox ID is the source of tenders interfaced from a lockbox.

- The remittance processor is the source of tenders interfaced from a remittance processor.

**NOTE:**
**Default note. When a user adds a tender control the system attempts to default a tender source based on the currency of**
the deposit control and the tender source(s) defined on the user's record. If your organization accepts alternate currency
payments, then a tender source must exist for each currency code accepted at a location.

**FASTPATH:**
For more information, refer to Setting Up Tender Sources.

A tender source's tenders must be balanced against an expected total before they can be deposited at a bank. This periodic
balancing requires all tenders to exist in respect of a Tender Control. Over time, a tender source may have many tender
controls (one per balancing event).

An example of a cashier's cash drawer will help clarify the tender control concept:

- When a cashier starts in the morning, they start with a fresh cash drawer (i.e., one without tenders). Whenever a drawer
starts afresh, a new Tender Control must be created because you balance the contents of a drawer.

- A cash drawer typically contains funds to make change. These funds are the tender control's Opening Balance.

**NOTE:**
**Default note. A tender control's starting balance defaults from its tender source.**

- During the day, customers remit tenders to the cashier. Every tender put into the drawer is associated with the drawer's
tender control created at the start of the day.

- A tender control's balance increases during the day as tenders are recorded. A cashier can view the balance at any time.

- The cashier can turn in funds to the head cashier during the day. Each turn in event can be recorded in the system. Note
well, if the amount of funds in a tender control exceeds the maximum balance defined on the tender control's tender
source, a warning is issued to the cashier to remind them to turn in funds.


-----

- At some point, the contents of the drawer must be balanced against the total tenders linked to the tender control. When
balancing starts, no additional tenders may be put into the tender control. If the cashier receives additional tenders after
balancing starts, a new tender control must be created (and the above process starts afresh).

- During the balancing process, some modifications may be made to the tenders associated with the tender control, but no
additional tenders may be added. When the tender control is balanced, neither it nor its tenders may be modified.

**FASTPATH:**
For more information, refer to Managing Your Cash Drawers.

While the above explanation is true, it isn't complete. In addition to the requirement that a tender must reference a tender
control, the tender control must refer to a Deposit Control. Deposit controls give you administrative control over all of the
tender controls whose contents will be deposited en masse. The following concepts will help explain the power of deposit
controls:

- As explained above, when a cash drawer is started afresh, a new tender control must be created. The tender control
"holds" all new tenders received by the cashier.

- Similarly, when a tender control is created, it must reference a deposit control. During the day, a deposit control's tender
controls are constantly changing. You can view the total impact of a deposit control's tender controls at any time.

- At some point, you will want to deposit the tenders received during the day. To do this, you must indicate how much will
be deposited at the bank. This deposit amount must equal the sum of the tender controls linked to the cash drawer. When
this deposit balancing starts, no additional tender controls may be associated with the deposit control.

- When the deposit total equals the sum of the tender controls, the deposit control becomes balanced and no changes may
be made to it, its tender controls, or its tender controls' tenders.

**FASTPATH:**
For more information, refer to Managing Your Cash Drawers.

**NOTE:**
**Background processes use the same concepts. Tenders that are interfaced from external sources (e.g., lockboxes and**
remittance processors) make use of the concepts describe above. For example, tenders interfaced from a remittance
processor are linked to a tender control and this tender control is linked to a deposit control. The main difference is that
the background processes require no human intervention; the system automatically creates tender and deposit controls
and sets their states to balanced when the interface concludes successfully.

**The ACH activation process also creates tender and deposit controls. Refer to Activating Automatic Payments for**
more information.

The topics in this section elaborate on the tender management concepts described above.

###### Managing Your Cash Drawers

**WARNING:**
This section assumes you are familiar with the concepts described in The Lifecycle Of A Deposit Control and The
Lifecycle Of A Tender Control.

There are many ways to handle the daily management of tenders received via cash drawers. It really depends on how your
organization works. To help you understand the potential of the system, we'll continue the example started above.

Assume that the cash drawers in your western office are balanced and deposited independently from those in your eastern
office. We'll assume that both offices follows the same daily routine:


-----

- Load fresh drawers first thing in the morning. Each drawer contains a starting balance of $150.00. Note: the drawer's
tender control's starting balance defaults from its tender source.

- At 10 am, the cashier turns in funds to the chief cashier and continues to receive additional tenders.

- At 12 noon, each drawer is pulled and balanced by a supervisor.

- By 12:30 pm, the tender controls are balanced.

- At 4 pm, the cashiering stations are closed. Each drawer is pulled and balanced by a supervisor.

- By 4:30 pm, the tender controls are balanced.

- At 5 pm, the deposit control is balanced and funds are ready to be deposited at the bank.

Given this, the following diagram illustrates the deposit controls and tender controls used by each office on a given day.

The following concepts are illustrated above:

- An Open deposit control must exist before you can create a tender control. And an Open tender control must exist before
you can create a tender. From a business process standpoint, this means:

  - A supervisor would create a deposit control at the start of the day (8 am in the above illustration).

  - Each cashier would create a tender control when they start a drawer and reference the deposit control created by the
supervisor.


-----

  - During the day, the cashier can turn-in moneys to the chief cashier. These turn-in events are recorded in the system as
they play a part in the ultimate balancing of the drawer. Refer to Turn Ins for more information.

  - At some point, the contents of a drawer can be pulled and balanced. If additional tenders can be received in a drawer,
a new tender control must be created for the drawer. Refer to Balancing By Tender Type for more information.

  - At the end of the day, the supervisor checks to make certain that all tender controls linked to the deposit control are
Balanced. After this has been done, the supervisor indicates the deposit amount on the deposit control and changes it
to Balanced. Notice that in the above illustration each deposit control references four tender controls.

**NOTE:**
**Alternate currency payments. If your organization accepts payments in alternate currencies, that is, a currency other**
than the account's currency; a supervisor would create a deposit control for each such currency. Likewise, the cashier
would create a tender control for each such currency.

**FASTPATH:**
Refer to Alternate Currency Payments for more information.

- Typically, a cash drawer has one tender control Open at any point in time (meaning that the tenders being received are
being linked to a specific tender control). However, this is not a hard rule. If you want, you may have multiple tender
controls Open at any point for a specific cash drawer (for example, if multiple cashiers can work the same drawer during
the day but take their drawer with them).

- Typically, a specific cashier puts tenders into a specific tender control. However, this is not a hard rule. On a tender
control, you can define if it's limited to a specific operator OR if any operator can link tenders to it.

- When you're ready to balance a drawer, you change the tender control to Balancing in Progress. This prevents new
tenders from being added to the tender control. If the cashier can continue to receive tenders, they must create another
tender control. In the above example, all drawers are balanced at 12 noon by a supervisor while the cashier continues to
take payments.

- When the tender control is balanced, you change its state to Balanced. This prevents any changes to the tender control or
its tenders.

- All tender controls exist in respect of a deposit control (in fact, the deposit control must be created before the tender
control). This way, a supervisor can check the state of the related drawers throughout the day. Notice that the state
transition of a deposit control is identical to that of the tender control (refer to The Lifecycle Of A Deposit Control and
The Lifecycle Of A Tender Control). There is only a temporal difference. Notice that the deposit control stays open
throughout the day while any number of tender controls are being opened and balanced.

**NOTE:**
**Multiple deposits in a day. While the above example illustrates a single deposit per office per day, it is quite possible to**
have multiple deposit controls on any given day.

**Turns ins. The above example did not illustrate the fact that a cashier can turn-in moneys during the day without having**
to balance the drawer. Refer to Turn Ins for more information.

###### Turn Ins

A cashier may optionally turn-in funds received into a cash drawer to a head cashier. The turn-in process requires two steps:

- Each time a cashier turns-in funds, they add a turn-in event on the Tender Control - Turn Ins page. Note that a separate
turn-in event is required for each type of tender that's turned in. This is because the balancing of a tender control is
performed for each tender type and therefore the system must know how much of each tender type has been removed
from the drawer.


-----

**NOTE:**
**Turn in warning. If the amount of cash-like funds in a tender control exceeds the maximum balance defined on the**
tender control's tender source, a warning is issued to the cashier to remind them to turn in funds.

- The head cashier (the person responsible for the deposit control associated with the various tender controls) approves the
turn in using the Deposit Control - Turn Ins page.

**NOTE:**
**All turn-ins must be approved for balancing to complete. A tender control cannot be balanced until the head cashier**
has approved all turn-in events.

###### Balancing By Tender Type

It should be noted that when it's time to balance a tender control, the cashier must enter the amount of each tender type that
is in the drawer in order to balance it. For example, assume the following takes place:

- A drawer is opened with a starting balance of $150.50 (tender type is Cash).

- During the day, the cashier receives $5,000 in Cash, and $1,000 in Checks.

- During the day, the cashier turns in $750 or the Checks and $4,000 of Cash.

At the end of the day, the following operator would have to enter the balances shown in the Ending Balance column.

Tender Type Starting Balance Tenders Received Turn Ins Ending Balance

Cash $150.50 $5,000 $4,000 $1150.50

Check - $1,000 $750 $250

**NOTE:**
**Time saver. The system assists in the balancing effort by amalgamating the amount of tenders by tender type when**
the tender control's status is changed from Open to Balancing In Progress. The cashier just needs to enter the Ending
Balance. The system can then compare the cashier's Ending Balance against the Expected Ending Balance. When these
values are equal for all tender types, the tender control's status can become Balanced.

###### Cash Back

When a payment is added, the user defines the following:

- The amount of debt to be relieved (i.e., the payment amount)

- The amount remitted (i.e., the tender amount)

- The form of the remittance (i.e., the tender type)

The payment amount typically equals the tender amount unless cash will be returned to the customer. For example, if a
customer remits $100, but only wants to pay off $25 of debt, the tender amount will be $100 and the payment amount will
be $25. The system will only allow a user to remit more than the payment amount if the tender type indicates "cash back"
is allowed. For example, you may not allow cash to be returned if a check is remitted, but you may allow it to be returned if
cash is remitted.


-----

If cash back is allowed for the tender type, the system displays the amount of cash to be returned on the Payment Event.
In addition, because the system enforces balancing the cash drawer by tender type, the system adjusts the payment event's
tendered information as follows:

- When there is cash back, the payment event will have two tenders - one will be for the amount and type entered by the
user, the other will be a negative amount with a tender type of cash (note, this tender type is retrieved from the Starting
Balance Tender Type on the installation record). For example, if a customer remits $100 in traveler's checks, but only
wants to pay off $25 of debt, there will be two tenders: one for the $100 travelers check and the other for the -$25 of
cash.

**NOTE:**
**Alternate currency payments. If your organization accepts payments in alternate currencies, that is, a currency other**
than the account's currency; the cash back tender is always created in the account's currency.

**NOTE:**
**Multiple tenders and payment cancellation. If multiple tenders were created because of "cash back" processing, both**
tenders must be cancelled if the payment event needs to be cancelled.

When modifying an unfrozen payment on the Payment Event, if the payment becomes unbalanced, a button is displayed
allowing the user to Recalculate Cash Back. If the user clicks this button, the system reassesses the cash back tender as
follows:

- If there is now cash back, a new tender is created for the credit amount

- If the cash back amount has changed, the tender for the cash back is adjusted to the new amount

- If there is no longer cash back due, the tender for the cash back is removed.

###### Managing Payments Interfaced From External Sources

Just like a payment recorded on-line via a cash drawer, a payment interfaced from an external source (e.g., lock box or
remittance processor) must reference a tender control and the tender controls, in turn, must reference a deposit control. The
only real differences between these two types of payments are highlighted below:

- Whilst an operator must create and balance the tender and deposit controls for real-time payments, the system creates the
tender and deposit controls associated with interfaced payments.

- It's impossible for an invalid account to be referenced on a payment recorded real-time. However, it is quite possible for
an interfaced payment to reference an unknown account. If an invalid account is referenced on an interfaced payment
(using no distribution rules), the system links it to the suspense service agreement referenced on the tender source control
table.

**FASTPATH:**
Refer to Interfacing Payments From External Sources for more information.

###### Payment Financial Transaction Considerations

A payment segment exists for each service agreement that receives a portion of a payment. Linked to every frozen payment
segment is a financial transaction. This financial transaction affects a service agreement's payoff balance and/or current
balance. It also contains the journal details that debt cash and credit some other account.

The topics in this section provide information about the financial impact of a payment segment.


-----

**FASTPATH:**
Refer to The Financial Big Picture for more information about a payment's place in the financial big picture.

###### Payment - Current Balance versus Payoff Balance

**WARNING:**
If you do not understand the difference between payoff balance and current balance, refer to Current Amount versus
Payoff Amount.

A payment segment financial transaction almost always affects payoff balance and current balance by the same amount
(think of it like this - when a customer pays, the amount they think they owe goes down by the amount they really owe).
The only exception is a payment segment for a charitable contribution. These payment segments only affect current balance
because the customer was never billed for the contribution in the first place.

**FASTPATH:**
Refer to Setting Up Payment Segment Types for more information about how payment segment type affects how a
payment segment is produced and how its financial transaction is generated.

###### The Source Of GL Accounts On A Payment Financial Transaction

A payment segment's financial transaction also contains the double-sided accounting entry that defines how the payment
segment affects the general ledger.

**FASTPATH:**
Refer to The Source Of GL Accounts On Financial Transactions for a description of where the system extracts the
distribution codes used to construct the GL accounts.

###### A Payment May Affect More Than Just Customer Balances

The topics in this section provide information about obscure things that may happen when a payment is distributed and
frozen.

Refer to Obscure Things That Can Happen for more information about things that can happen when an FT is frozen
(and FT's get frozen when a payment is frozen).

###### Automatic Payments

This section discusses how to set up and manage customers who pay their bills automatically (via direct debit or credit card
debits)

###### How To Set Up A Customer To Pay Automatically

If a customer wants to pay automatically, transfer to Account - Auto Pay and define the source of the funds and the
customer's account or credit card number.

###### What Are Automatic Payments?

An automatic payment is just like any other payment (refer to A Payment Event Has Payments And Tenders for more
information about payments in general). However, automatic payments have one special trait - they cause funds to be
transferred into your company's bank account. Refer to Downloading Automatic Payments and Interfacing Them To The
GL for how this transference happens.

###### How And When Are Automatic Payments Created?

Automatic payments can be created in several ways:

- The system creates automatic payments for bills linked to accounts with an active auto pay option (note, the system uses
the account's autopay option that's effective on the bill's due date). When the system does this is dependent on the value
of the Autopay Creation Option on the installation record:

  - If you've set this option to Create At Bill Completion, the automatic payment is created when the account's bill is
completed. The payment is distributed and frozen at the same time. This means that the account's balance is almost
always zero (or in credit if they have a deposit). You will see the automatic payments in the payment list immediately
after the bill is completed (rather than waiting until the automatic payment's extraction date).

  - If you've set this option to Create On Extract Date, the automatic payment is NOT created when the bill is completed.
Rather,

- At bill completion time, the bill is stamped with the automatic payment's extract date and amount. The date is the
automatic payment source's extraction date (refer to Automatic Payment Dates for more information on how this date is
calculated).

- The automatic payment background process ( APAYCRET) creates the automatic payment on the extract date stamped
on the bill. If the supplied Auto Pay Creation algorithm (APAY-CREATE) is used and is configured to override the
automatic payment amount based on the account’s current balance, the algorithm can either adjust the auto pay amount
(if the balance is less than the original auto pay amount) or skip automatic payment creation (if the balance is zero or a
credit). Refer to the algorithm type description for more details.

- The automatic payment is NOT distributed and frozen when the automatic payment is initially created. A separate
background process ( APAYDSFR) distributes and freezes the automatic payment on the automatic payment GL


-----

distribution date (refer to Automatic Payment Dates for more information on how this date is calculated). This means
that the customer's balance increases when the bill is completed and is only reduced when the automatic payment is
marked for interface to the general ledger.
Note that it is possible for automatic payments to be distributed and frozen after being extracted and interfaced to a
financial institution. Please refer to Downloading Automatic Payments and Interfacing Them To The GL and The
Nightly Processes.

An algorithm plugged in on the Installation Record calculates the payment amount whether the automatic payment is
created at bill completion time or on the extract date. Please refer to APAM-DFLT for more information about how the
algorithm that is supplied with the base package calculates this amount.

**NOTE:**
**With balance forward accounting, automatic payments are not just for new charges. The base package algorithm**
includes prior balances when it creates a customer's first automatic payment. For example, if a customer has an existing
balance of $100 and then signs up for automatic payment, their next bill will cause an automatic payment of $100 plus
any new charges to be created (assuming the $100 remains unpaid at the time the next bill is completed). Refer to Open
Item Versus Balance Forward Accounting for information about balance forward accounting.

- If a customer with a pay plan indicates that the payment method is via "autopay", a background process ( PPAPAY)
creates an automatic payment on the scheduled payment dates. Please note, if the Autopay Creation Option on the
installation record is set to Create On Extract Date, the automatic payment is NOT distributed and frozen when the
automatic payment is initially created. Rather, a separate background process ( APAYDSFR) distributes and freezes
the automatic payment on the automatic payment GL distribution date (refer to Automatic Payment Dates for more
information on how this date is calculated). Refer to The Big Picture Of Pay Plans for more information about pay plans.

- If a customer with an account that is set up for automatic payment has a Non-Billed Budget that is not excluded from
automatic payment, a background process ( NBBAPAY) creates an automatic payment on the scheduled payment dates.
Please note, if the Autopay Creation Option on the installation record is set to Create On Extract Date, the automatic
payment is NOT distributed and frozen when the automatic payment is initially created. Rather, a separate background
process ( APAYDSFR) distributes and freezes the automatic payment on the automatic payment GL distribution date
(refer to Automatic Payment Dates for more information on how this date is calculated). Refer to What is a Non-Billed
**Budget for more information about Non-Billed Budgets.**

- A user can create an automatic payment by simply adding a payment tender with a tender type that indicates it is
for automatic payment purposes. This would be a rather unusual thing to do, but you might do this if you want to
immediately debit a customer's bank account after a large adjustment is added to the system (e.g., if they suddenly
owe you a lot of money and you don't want to wait until the next bill to collect it). Automatic payments created by this
method must be distributed and frozen before they can be extracted.

- When a checking or savings account is used for the first-time on a self-service automatic payment enrollment, selfservice one time payment or self-service payment option management, a payment event, payment tender and auto pay
stagning records are created for prenotification purposes. Refer to Web Debit Account Validation for more details.

**NOTE:**
**An algorithm is used to create automatic payments. The logic used to create automatic payments is plugged in on**
the Installation Record. This algorithm is not called when a user manually creates an automatic payment (by adding
a payment tender with a tender type that indicates that it is for automatic payment purposes) and when the automatic
payment is for prenotification purposes.

When an automatic payment is first created, it gets marked with a distribution date. The distribution date is the date on
which the automatic payment's FT's GL details can be interfaced to the general ledger (via the standard GL interface). The
distribution date is determined as follows:

- Every automatic payment references an auto-pay source.

- Every auto-pay source references an auto-pay route type.


-----

- Every auto-pay route type contains an algorithm that is responsible for calculating the GL Distribution (Posting) date. On
the GL distribution date, the automatic payment will be interfaced to the general ledger.

###### Automatic Payment Dates

As described in the previous section, an algorithm (that's plugged in on Auto Pay Route Types) controls the date on which
the automatic payment is interfaced to your general ledger. We refer to this date as the GL distribution date.

This algorithm also populates the following dates:

- The payment date that is stored on the payment.

- The date on which the automatic payment is interfaced to the financial institution.

The algorithm that is supplied with the base package provides many parameters that allow you to dictate how these dates are
calculated. Please refer to APAY-DTCALC for the details.

###### How To Implement Maximum Withdrawal Limits

In some locales, customers can define a "maximum withdrawal amount" to limit the amount of money that is automatically
debited from their bank account. For example, a low-income customer may want to prevent direct debits of more than $50
from being applied to their checking account.

You define a customer's maximum withdrawal amount when you setup their automatic payment information on Account Auto Pay.

The following points describe how the system implements maximum withdrawal limits:

- When a bill is completed for a customer who pays automatically the system calls the automatic payment creation
algorithm that's plugged in on the Installation Record. The base-package autopay creation algorithm (APAY-CREATE)
checks if the amount of the automatic payment exceeds the customer's maximum withdrawal amount. If so, the autopay
creation algorithm calls the automatic payment over limit algorithm that's plugged in on the account's customer class.
Algorithms of this type have the ability to reduce the amount of the autopay or to prevent the autopay from being created.
Refer to APOL-RA for an example plug-in.

- When a user manually creates an automatic payment (by adding a tender with a tender type that indicates that it is for
automatic payment purposes), the system issues a warning message when the tender amount exceeds the account's
maximum withdrawal amount.

**NOTE:**
**Pay plans and Non-Billed Budgets. Automatic payments that are created as a result of pay plans and Non-Billed**
Budgets are not subject to maximum withdrawal limits. This is because both of these options required customer
approval and therefore the customer should be able to plan accordingly. Refer to How And When Are Automatic
Payments Created for more information.

###### How Are Automatic Payments Cancelled?

There are two ways to cancel an automatic payment:

- The system will cancel an automatic payment behind-the-scenes if the related bill (if any) is reopened BEFORE the
automatic payment is interfaced to the financial institution. When you recomplete the bill, the system will create a new
automatic payment that reflects the new amount due (and the canceled automatic payment will net out the original
automatic payment).


-----

- An operator can cancel an automatic payment (refer to How To Cancel A Tender) at any time. You would do this if the
automatic payment was rejected by the financial institution.

**FASTPATH:**
Refer to Credit / Correction Notes and Auto Pay for information about how a credit note may cancel an automatic
payment.

###### Match Events Are Created For Open-Item Customers When An Automatic Payment Is Created

The system creates a match event when a bill is completed for open-item customers that pay automatically (i.e., direct debit
customers). The match event groups together the bill's new charges against the automatic payment's payment segments.

If the bill is subsequently re-opened, the match event will be cancelled when the automatic payment is cancelled.

**FASTPATH:**
Refer to Open Item Accounting for more information.

###### Pay Plans and Automatic Payments

If a customer wants to pay their pay plan scheduled payments automatically, the account must be set up for automatic
payment (as described under How To Set Up A Customer To Pay Automatically). In addition, the payment method defined
on the pay plan must indicate automatic payment is being used.

When this is done, a background process (PPAPAY) creates automatic payments on the scheduled payment date by calling
the automatic payment creation algorithm plugged in on the installation record.

###### Non-Billed Budgets and Automatic Payment

If a customer wants to pay their Non-Billed Budget scheduled payments automatically, the account must be set up for
automatic payment (as described under How To Set Up A Customer To Pay Automatically). In addition, the Non-Billed
Budget must indicate that automatic payment is being used.

When this is done, a background process (NBBAPAY) creates automatic payments on the scheduled payment date by
calling the automatic payment creation algorithm plugged in on the installation record.

###### Downloading Automatic Payments and Interfacing Them To The GL

The following diagram illustrates the background processes that interface automatic payment out of the system:


-----

These processes are described in the following topics.

###### ACTVTAPY - Activating Automatic Payments

When an automatic payment is first created, it gets marked with an extract date. The extract date is the date the automatic
payment will be downloaded to the respective financial institution. The extract date is determined as follows:

- Every automatic payment references an auto-pay source.

- Every auto-pay source references an auto-pay route type.

- Every auto-pay route type contains an algorithm that calculates this date.

On the extract date, the automatic payment is "activated". The automatic payment is activated is marked for download the
next time its download process runs. An automatic payment's download process is defined on its auto-pay source's route
type.

###### APAYACH - Download Automatic Payments To The ACH (Automated Clearing House)

This process reads all auto pay download staging records marked with a given batch control ID and run number, and creates
the flat file that's passed to the ACH. Refer to ACH Record Layouts for the details of the record layouts.

The following outlines the differences between APAYACH and C1-APACH:

- APAYACH uses the Business Process Date as the draft date. C1-APACH populates the Effective Entry Date field on the
Company Batch Header Record with a date (the actual draft date) as to when the payment should be withdrawn from the
customer's account.


-----

- APAYACH produces a file that has one File Header Record, a Company Batch Header Record per payment source (if
multiple payment sources exist), and multiple detail lines. C1-APACH produces a file with multiple occurrences of the
Company Batch Header Record differing on the Effective Entry Date field and the payment source (if multiple payment
sources exist).

**NOTE:**
**This process may be rerun. You can reproduce the flat file at any time. Simply request this job and specify the run**
number associated with the historic run.

If you require a different flat file format, you must create additional versions of this program. Refer to Setting Up Automatic
Payment Extracts for instructions describing how to add another process.

###### C1-APACH - Download Automatic Payments To The ACH (Automated Clearing House)

This process is an alternative to using APAYACH. Similar to APAYACH, this process reads all auto pay download staging
records marked with a given batch control ID and run number, and creates the flat file that's passed to the ACH. Refer to
ACH Record Layouts for the details of the record layouts.

The following outlines the differences between APAYACH and C1-APACH:

- C1-APACH populates the Effective Entry Date field on the Company Batch Header Record with a date (the actual draft
date) as to when the payment should be withdrawn from the customer's account. APAYACH uses the Business Process
Date as the draft date.

- C1-APACH produces a file with multiple occurrences of the Company Batch Header Record differing on the Effective
Entry Date field and payment source (if multiples payment sources exist). APAYACH produces a file that has one File
Header Record, a Company Batch Header Record per payment source (if multiple payment sources exist), and multiple
detail lines.

**NOTE:**
**This process may be rerun. You can reproduce the flat file at any time. Request this job and specify the run number**
associated with the historic run.

If you require a different flat file format, you must create additional versions of this program. Refer to Setting Up Automatic
Payment Extracts for instructions describing how to add another process.

###### C1-SDDCE - SEPA Direct Debit Payment Extract

This process reads all auto pay download staging records marked with a given batch control ID and run number to create an
XML extract file that's passed to the financial institution. Refer to SEPA Direct Debit Record Layouts for the details of the
record layouts.

**NOTE:**
**This process may be rerun. You can reproduce the XML extract at any time. Simply request this job and specify the**
run number associated with the historic run.

###### C1-TAPEX - Third Party Auto Pay Extract

This process reads all auto pay download staging records marked with a given batch control ID and run number to create an
extract file that is sent to the third party payment processing system.


-----

This is a plugin-driven batch process that supports any of three file layouts (comma-separated values (CSV), fixed position
and XML) specified in an input batch parameter.

The C1–TAPEX batch control is delivered with two algorithms plugged in:

- A Select Records algorithm is responsible for selecting the auto pay staging records to download.

- A Process Record algorithm is responsible for formatting and writing each extract record into the output flat file.

Your implementation can plug in your own Select Records and Process Record algorithms if your business rules for this
extract differ.

This batch process is meant to be run after the Activate auto-pay (ACTVTAPY) runs and before Third Party Auto Pay
Tender Controls (C1–TAPCT) runs.

Refer to Third Party Auto Pay Record Layouts for the details of the record layouts.

**NOTE:**
**This process may be rerun. You can reproduce the XML extract at any time. Simply request this job and specify the**
run number associated with the historic run.

###### BALAPY - Creating Automatic Payment Tender Controls

This process creates a new tender control (with an associated deposit control) for each unique batch control ID and run
number encountered in the extracted automatic payments (where its payment tender is not yet linked to a tender control).
The payment tender of each of these automatic payments is then linked to the corresponding tender control. This process
also balances the open tender control records afterwards.

**NOTE:** A separate batch process (C1-BLAPC) must be scheduled after BALAPY to balance open tender and deposit
control records.

###### C1-BLAPY - Create Autopay Tender Controls

This process creates a new tender control (with an associated deposit control) for each unique batch control ID and run
number encountered in the extracted automatic payments (where its payment tender is not yet linked to a tender control).

This is a plugin driven version of BALAPY. The difference is that it excludes payments that were processed by a third party
payment processing system. These are handled by other tender controls processes - C1–TAPCT (for third party auto pays)
and C1–TOPCT (for third party one time payments)

The C1–BLAPY batch control is delivered with two algorithms plugged in:

- A Select Records algorithm is responsible for determining the auto pay staging records to process.

- A Process Record algorithm is responsible for linking the auto pay record’s payment tender to the tender control.

Your implementation can plug in your own Select Records and Process Record algorithms if your business rules for this
extract differ.

**NOTE:** A separate batch process (C1-BLAPC) must be scheduled after C1–BLAPY to balance open tender and deposit
control records.

###### C1-BLAPC - Balance Autopay Control Tables

This batch process is responsible for balancing tender and deposit control tables in the autopay extract process. This batch
process is executed after BALAPY completes.

###### Third Party Payment Processing

A third party payment processing system is a service provider that can handle all aspects of electronic payments for a
utility. When this service provider is integrated with Oracle Utilities Customer To Meter., every payment made through
channels such as web self-service or integrated voice response (IVR) is accepted and processed within the service provider’s
fully hosted payment acceptance environment. Payment data (credit card number, bank account number, etc) is stored and
processed outside of the utility’s network.

The following sections describe the functions that are supported when this product is integrated with a third party payment
processing system.

###### One Time Payments

A one time payment is a one-off, non-recurring payment option where the third party payment processing is authorized to
collect a payment from a utility customer’s credit card or bank account.

One time payments can be immediate or scheduled:

- Immediate one-time payments are processed on the same date that the payment is created/captured in the third party
payment processing system.

- Scheduled one-time payments are processed at a future date that the customer designates.

The base product provides an inbound web service C1-ThirdPartyOneTimePayNotification that receives one time
payment information from the third party payment processor, and, based on the required action, creates/updates the payment
in the system. This web service supports the following functions:

- Creating an immediate or scheduled one time payment.

- Updating a scheduled one time payment

- Processing a scheduled one time payment

- Canceling a processed one time payment

The following sections describe these actions.

###### Creating One Time Payments

When the third party payment processing system processes a new one time payment, it will call the C1**ThirdPartyOneTimePayNotification inbound web service with an Add action. The payment details include the payment**
date/time, payment amount and basic details about the payment method (i.e., bank account or credit card).


-----

**NOTE:** Because bank account numbers and credit card numbers are captured outside of the system, the full account
numbers are not sent. In most cases, only a partial value is sent, e.g. last four digits.

The inbound web service processes the payment as follows:

- If the Payment Date is the current date, it is processed as an immediate payment.

  - The system creates a Third Party One Time Payment Task, which in turn creates a frozen payment.

  - The payment date/time sent in by the third party payment processor is stored as a characteristic on the payment tender
using the Processing Date/Time Characteristic Type in the Third Party One Time Payment Processing Integration
master configuration. This is to capture the actual date/time when the payment was processed. This information is
used in tender control processing.

**NOTE:** The payment date/time is validated for XSD format. Any subsequent manual updates to this date/time will
need to be in the correct XSD format. An adhoc characteristic validation algorithm type C1–VALDATE exists for
this purpose.

  - A reference to the Third Party One Time Payment Task’s Service Task ID is stored as a characteristic on the
payment tender using the Processing Reference Characteristic Type in the Third Party One Time Payment Processing
Integration master configuration. This helps identify that the payment event/tender was created from third party
payment processing.

  - The Payment Event ID is sent back to the third party payment processing system so that it has a way to identify the
payment should there be a need to cancel the payment in the future.

- If the Payment Date is a future date, it is processed as a scheduled payment.

  - The system creates a pending Third Party One Time Payment Task. No further action is taken until the third party
payment processing system sends another notification that the scheduled payment has been processed.

  - The Service Task ID is sent back to the third party payment processing system so that it has a way to identify the
service task on subsequent requests to either update or process the pending one time payment.

**NOTE:** To prevent the creation of duplicate payments when the web service times out and the third party payment
processing retries the web service call:

  - The system checks if a frozen payment was already created from a previous web service call.

  - The account is locked during payment event creation.

For more information about the lifecycle of the Third Party One Time Payment Notification service task, refer to the C1**ThirdPartyOneTimePayTask business object in the system.**

For more information about master configuration settings, refer to the Third Party Payment Processing Integration
master configuration in the system.

###### Updating Scheduled One Time Payments

If the third party payment processing system receives a request from the customer to update an existing one time payment, it
will call the C1-ThirdPartyOneTimePayNotification inbound web service with an Update action, passing in the pending
one time payment’s Service Task ID and the updated payment details.

**NOTE:** Because bank account numbers and credit card numbers are captured outside of the system, the full account
numbers are not sent. In most cases, only a partial value is sent, e.g. last four digits..

The inbound web service updates the existing Third Party One Time Payment Task with the new payment details sent in.
The Third Party One Time Payment Task remains in the Pending state.


-----

For more information about the lifecycle of the Third Party One Time Payment Notification service task, refer to the C1**ThirdPartyOneTimePayTask business object in the system.**

###### Processing Scheduled One Time Payments

When it is time to process a scheduled one time payment, the third party payment processing will process the payment as
it does an immediate one time payment. However, in this case, it will call the C1-ThirdPartyOneTimePayNotification
inbound web service with a Process action, passing in the pending one time payment’s Service Task ID and the payment
details.

**NOTE:** Because bank account numbers and credit card numbers are captured outside of the system, the full account
numbers are not sent. In most cases, only a partial value is sent, e.g. last four digits.

The inbound web service processes the one time payment as follows:

- The system transitions the existing Third Party One Time Payment Task so that it proceeds to create a frozen payment
event.

- The payment date/time sent in by the third party payment processor is stored as a characteristic on the payment tender
using the Processing Date/Time Characteristic Type in the Third Party One Time Payment Processing Integration master
configuration. This is to capture the actual date/time when the payment was processed. This information is used in tender
control processing.

- A reference to the Third Party One Time Payment Task’s Service Task ID is stored as a characteristic on the payment
tender using the Processing Reference Characteristic Type in the Third Party One Time Payment Processing Integration
master configuration. This helps identify that the payment event/tender was created from third party payment processing.

- The Payment Event ID is sent back to the third party payment processing system so that it has a way to identify the
payment should there be a need to cancel the payment in the future.

**NOTE:** To prevent the creation of duplicate payments when the web service times out and the third party payment
processing retries the web service call:

  - The system checks if a frozen payment was already created from a previous web service call.

  - The account is locked during payment event creation.

For more information about the lifecycle of the Third Party One Time Payment Notification service task, refer to the C1**ThirdPartyOneTimePayTask business object in the system.**

For more information about master configuration settings, refer to the Third Party Payment Processing Integration
master configuration in the system.

###### Canceling One Time Payments

Scheduled or processed one time payments could get canceled for specific reasons. For instance, a processed payment could
get canceled if a customer disputed a credit card charge or if the bank account has insufficient funds. When there is a need
to cancel an existing scheduled or processed one time payment, the third party payment processor will cancel the one time
payment in their system and call the C1-ThirdPartyOneTimePayNotification inbound web service with a Cancel action,
passing in either a pending one time payment’s Service Task ID (if canceling a scheduled payment) or a processed one time
payment’s Payment Event ID (if canceling a processed payment).

The inbound web service processes the one time payment cancellation as follows:

- For a scheduled on time payment, the existing Third Party One Time Payment Task is simply transitioned to the
Discarded state.

- For a processed payment, the cancellation is processed as follows:


-----

  - Since the original Third Party One Time Payment Task is already in the Completed state, a new Third Party One
Time Payment Task is created to process the cancellation. Logic on the Process Payment state will cancel the existing
Payment Tender using the Payment Event ID that is passed in from the web service.

  - The Tender Cancel Reason is taken from the Third Party Payment Processing Integration master configuration.

  - A reference to the cancellation Service Task ID is stored as a characteristic on the payment tender using the
Cancellation Reference Characteristic Type that is defined in master configuration.

  - If master configuration is also set up with a Payment Auto-Cancel To Do Type, a To Do Entry is created.

For more information about the lifecycle of the Third Party One Time Payment Notification service task, refer to the C1**ThirdPartyOneTimePayTask business object in the system.**

For more information about master configuration settings, refer to the Third Party Payment Processing Integration
master configuration in the system.

###### Account Verification

A third party payment processing system can perform account verification prior to processing one time payments and
automatic payment enrollments. This is to verify that the account exists, as well as to get specific information about the
account such as the account balance, due date, past due amount, and existing auto pay information.

The base product provides an inbound web service C1-ThirdPartyVerifyAccount that receives an Account ID from the
third party payment processor and creates a Third Party Account Verification Task that is responsible for verifying the
account. Base-supplied logic on this service task checks that the account exists and returns the account’s balance, due date,
past due amount (if any) and existing auto pay information (if any). Refer to the C1-ThirdPartyAcctVerifTask business
object for more details.

###### Automatic Payment Setup

When the system is integrated with a third party payment processing system, customers who opt for automatic bill payment
enrol through the third party payment processing system, where payment information that includes credit card or bank
account number are captured and stored.

The third party payment processing system sends a notification when it processes new or updated account auto pay
information.

The base product provides an inbound web service C1-ThirdPartyAutoPaySetup that receives auto pay setup information
and creates a Third Party Auto Pay Setup Task, which is responsible for creating or updating the account’s auto pay
information. Base-supplied logic on this service task adds an account auto pay option, updates an existing account auto pay
option’s details or cancels an existing account auto pay option by setting its end date to the designated date. Refer to the C1**ThirdPartyAutoPayTask business object for more details.**

###### Interfacing Automatic Payments To A Third Party

For customers who are enrolled to automatically pay bills through a third party payment processing system, existing auto
pay processing that occurs during bill completion applies. Refer to How And When Are Automatic Payments Created? for
more details.

The difference with automatic payment processing via third party payment processing system is that the auto pay staging
records are not sent directly to the financial institution. Since the routing is different, a third party payment processing
system is associated with a distinct Auto Pay Source and Auto Pay Route Type. Refer to Define Auto Pay Sources and Auto
Pay Route Types for more details on this configuration.


-----

Third party automatic payment transactions are extracted using the Third Party Auto Pay Extract (C1–TAPEX) batch
process. Refer to Downloading Automatic Payments and Interfacing Them To The GL for details on how this batch process
fits into the auto pay batch process flows.

###### Highlighting Scheduled Payments

The Scheduled Payments Log zone in Control Central - Account Information displays the following:

- Pending third party one time payments

- Pending self-service one time payments

- Pending bill-related automatic payment records

- One time payments in error that have not been resolved, i.e. not succeeded by a Pending or Completed one time payment

Refer to the zone help for more information.

###### Automatic Payment Confirmations And Cancellations

A third party payment processing system can notify the system about whether or not the auto pay transactions sent to it for
processing were processed successfully.

The base product provides two batch processes, one each for auto pay confirmation and auto pay cancellation. Refer to the
following sections for more details.

###### C1-TAPDF - Third Party Auto Pay Confirmations

This batch process receives a comma-delimited (CSV) file containing information about auto pay transactions that were
successfully processed at the third party payment processing system. Each record contains the following:

- Account ID

- Auto Pay Clearing ID (i.e. PK of the auto pay staging record)

- Payment Date/Time

A Process Record algorithm C1-TAPDF-PR is plugged in on this batch control. For each record in the file, it distributes
and freezes the payment associated with the auto pay staging record. It also updates the payment event date if it differs from
the payment date sent with the confirmation. The payment date/time on the confirmation is stored as a characteristic on the
auto pay tender.

###### C1-TAPCN - Third Party Auto Pay Cancellations

This batch process receives a comma-delimited (CSV) file containing information about auto pay transactions that were not
processed successfully at the third party payment processing system. Each record contains the following:

- Account ID

- Auto Pay Clearing ID (i.e. PK of the auto pay staging record)

A Process Record algorithm C1-TAPCN-PR is plugged in on this batch control. For each record in the file, it cancels
the tender associated with the auto pay staging record, using the Tender Cancel Reason that is defined in the Third Party
Payment Processing Integration master configuration.


-----

###### Third Party Payment Tender Controls Processing

A third party payment processing system handles two types of payments: one time payments and recurring automatic bill
payments.

The third party payment processing system sets the daily cutoff time for payment processing. For instance, a third party
payment processor could set the default daily processing cutoff time to 8pm Eastern Time. But each implementation
can override this processing cutoff time. The third party’s processing cutoff time is defined in the Third Party Payment
Processing Integration master configuration.

For recurring bill auto pays, the system will create the payment event, payment (non-frozen), tender and auto pay staging
record. The Tender Control ID is not assigned until a batch process runs and creates the tender and deposit controls for the
extracted auto pay transactions.

For one time payments, the assumption is that tender and deposit control processing will be handled in the same way as
the recurring auto pays. The one time payment's tender will not be linked to a tender control at one time payment tender
creation time. Instead, the tender control will be created in batch, similar to how recurring auto pay tender controls are
created.

The base product provides two batch processes for Third Party Auto Pay Tender Controls (C1–TAPCT) and Third Party
One Time Payment Tender Controls (C1–TOPCT). For a third party one time payment, a pre-processing batch process C1–
TOPPP takes the place of the usual auto pay extract process. This is because third party one time payment auto pays are
used purely for tender controls processing and are not sent out to the third party payment processing.

The following sections describe these batch processes.

###### C1-TAPCT - Third Party Auto Pay Tender Controls

This process creates a tender control (with an associated deposit control) for each batch control and run number encountered
for third party automatic payments that are not yet linked to a tender control.

This is a plugin-driven batch process. The C1–TAPCT batch control is delivered with two algorithms plugged in:

- A Select Records algorithm is responsible for selecting the auto pay staging records to process.

- A Process Record algorithm is responsible for linking each auto pay staging record’s payment tender to the
corresponding tender control.

Your implementation can plug in your own Select Records and Process Record algorithms if your business rules for this
extract differ.

This batch process is meant to be run after the Third Party Auto Pay Extract (C1–TAPEX) runs and before Balance Autopay
Control Tables (C1–BLAPC) runs.

###### C1-TOPPP - Third Party One Time Payment Controls Pre-Processing

This process reads all auto pay download staging records marked with a given batch control ID and run number, to verify
that the associated one time payment was processed within the current processing cutoff time. Any one time payments that
were processed after the cutoff will be updated with the next batch run number.

This is a plugin-driven batch process.

The C1–TOPPP batch control is delivered with two algorithms plugged in:

- A Select Records algorithm is responsible for selecting the auto pay staging records to retrieve, based on the input batch
code and batch run number..

- A Process Record algorithm is responsible for verifying that each auto pay staging record selected was processed within
the current cutoff time.


-----

Your implementation can plug in your own Select Records and Process Record algorithms if your business rules for this
extract differ.

This batch process is meant to be run after the Activate auto-pay (ACTVTAPY) runs and before Third Party One Time
Payment Tender Controls (C1–TOPCT) runs. This batch control should be specified on your configured auto pay route type
for third party one time payments.

###### C1-TOPCT - Third Party One Time Payment Tender Controls

This process creates a tender control (with an associated deposit control) for each batch control and run number encountered
for third party one time payments that are not yet linked to a tender control.

This is a plugin-driven batch process. The C1–TOPCT batch control is delivered with two algorithms plugged in:

- A Select Records algorithm is responsible for selecting the auto pay staging records to process.

- A Process Record algorithm is responsible for linking each auto pay staging record’s payment tender to the
corresponding tender control.

Your implementation can plug in your own Select Records and Process Record algorithms if your business rules differ.

This batch process is meant to be run after the Third Party Auto Pay Extract (C1–TOPPP) runs and before Balance Autopay
Control Tables (C1–BLAPC) runs.

###### Issuing A Payment Advice Instead Of Creating An Automatic Payment

If the system is configured to send the customer a payment advice (instead of initiating an electronic funds transfer) when a
bill is completed, the automatic payment records - i.e. payment event, payment, tender and auto pay clearinghouse staging are not created. Refer to Payment Advices for more information.

###### How To Set Up A Customer To Receive Payment Advices

Use Account - Auto Pay to capture the customer's bank details and indicate an auto pay method of Payment Advice.

###### Payment Advice Option Is For Bill-Related Automatic Payments Only

Payment advices can be printed for auto pays that result from completed bills.

An auto pay for a pay plan scheduled payment will not be created if the account's effective auto pay option is set to Payment
Advice. The Pay Plan Auto Pay ( PPAPAY ) batch process will log an error in this case.

An auto pay for a Non-Billed Budget scheduled payment will not be created if the account's effective auto pay option is set
to Payment Advice. The Non-Billed Budget Pay Plan Auto Pay ( NBBAPAY ) batch process will log an error in this case.

Manually created automatic payments (i.e. auto pays created via payment event UI) are always processed as direct debit.

##### Maintaining Payment Events

A payment event is used to record when moneys are remitted and how the moneys are allocated amongst accounts. The
topics in this section describe how to maintain payment events.


-----

**NOTE:**
**The system creates most payment events behind-the-scenes. Most payment events are created by the system when**
it uploads payments and when it creates automatic payments. You should only have to access the payment event
transaction if you need to correct a payment event or add a payment event real-time. For information about how the
system creates payment events, refer to The Big Picture of Payments.

###### Payment Lifecycles

The topics in this section describe the lifecycle of the various payment objects.

###### Payment Event Lifecycle

The following diagram shows the possible lifecycle of a payment event.

**WARNING:**
This diagram only makes sense in the context of the page used to maintain payment events. Refer to Payment Event Main Information for the details.

The system, by default, distributes the sum of a payment event's tenders to the account that remits the tenders. After
distribution the sum of the tenders equals the sum of the payments (remember, the term payment is used to refer to an
allocation of some/all of a payment event's tenders to an account's debt) when the event is first created. We refer to such an
event as being Balanced.

It is possible via any of the methods described in Unbalanced Payment Events to make a balanced payment event
Unbalanced.

Click Delete to physically remove a balanced or unbalanced payment event from the database. You may not delete a
payment event if: a) there are frozen or canceled payments linked to the event, or b) if there are canceled tenders linked to
the event, or c) if a tender linked to the event is part of a balanced tender control. When the payment event is deleted, the
system also deletes its tenders, payments, and payment segments.

###### Tender Lifecycle

The following diagram shows the possible lifecycle of a payment event.

**WARNING:**


-----

This diagram only makes sense in the context of the page used to maintain tenders. Refer to Payment Event - Tenders
for the details.

A tender is initially saved in the Valid state. It is possible via any of the methods described in Unbalanced Payment Events
to make a balanced payment event Unbalanced.

If a tender is invalid, click Cancel to cancel the tender AND ALL PAYMENTS LINKED TO THE EVENT.

Click the delete button to physically remove a tender from the database. You may not delete a tender if it is part of a
balanced tender control.

###### Payment Lifecycle

The following diagram shows the possible lifecycle of a payment.

**WARNING:**
This diagram only makes sense in the context of the page used to maintain a payment. Refer to Payment - Main for the
details.


-----

Payments are initially created in the Incomplete state. Payments in this state don't have payment segments or financial
transactions; they are simply a stub awaiting distribution.

Click Distribute to distribute a payment amongst an account's service agreements.

- If the system cannot distribute the payment (for whatever reason), the payment is moved to the Error state. You may
delete such a payment.

- If the system successfully distributes a payment, the payment becomes Freezable.

Click the - button to physically remove an Incomplete, Error or Freezable payment from the database.

Click Freeze to freeze a payment and its financial transaction. Freezing the payment causes the following to occur:

- The system executes any payment freeze algorithms linked to the account's customer class and to the service agreement's
SA type.

- The payment's state becomes Frozen and the payment may now appear on a customer's bill.

You may not change a payment once it is frozen. However, you may reverse the payment's financial effect by clicking
**Cancel. Clicking this button will cause the following to occur:**

- A new financial transaction is generated and linked to the payment. This financial transaction reverses the financial
effects of the original payment.

- The system executes any payment cancellation algorithms linked to the account's customer class.

- If the payment has a related adjustment, this adjustment is also cancelled. Refer to Loan Overpayments for an example of
payments with adjustments.

- The payment becomes Canceled.

The Payment Event transaction features an unusual dialog that simplifies the addition of new payment events. This page
appears if you open the Menu > Financial > Payment Event > Add from either the Account context menu or from Menu
(it also appears if you click the clear button when on the Payment Event page).

**NOTE:**
If you have opted to always use the payment event distribution rules method as your default method, the Payment Event
Quick Add (Single Payment Event) page appears instead.

There is an Add One-Time Payment dialog that behaves similarly to Payment Event - Add, but adds a number of
capabilities related to automatic payment methods. Refer to Add One-Time Payment for more details. To use the Add
One-Time Payment popup instead of the Payment Event - Add popup, refer to One-Time Payment Options for details on
enablement.

**Description of Page**

The Payor Account ID is the account that remitted the payment. We assume this account is both the tendering account and
the account whose debt is being relieved by the payment. If this assumption is not correct, choose a Distribute Action of
Do Not Distribute and then change the tendering or paying account when the Payment Event page appears (after you click
**OK).**

**NOTE:**
**Default note. If you have navigated to this page from account context menu, the Payor Account ID and Payment**
Amount are defaulted to this account.

The Payment Amount is the amount of the customer's debt to be relieved by the payment. Note, this amount is defaulted
using an algorithm plugged in on the Installation Record. Please refer to the Automatic Payment Amount Calculation
algorithm, (C1-APAM-DFLT) for more information on the calculation.

The payment tenders grid allows you to enter multiple tender types and amounts. Click + to add a new tender. For each
tender specify the following fields:

- The Amount Tendered is the amount of moneys remitted for the tender type.

- **Tender Type describes what was remitted (e.g., cash, check, ...). Tender Type defaults from the Quick Add Tender**
Type that is defined on the installation record.

- If a check was tendered, use Check Number to specify the identity of the check.

**NOTE:**
**Cash back causes an additional tender to be created. If cash should be returned to the customer (because the**
customer overpaid and the tender type's cash back allowed switch is true and the tender type is not "like cash"), a
negative tender for the cash back amount is created for the payment event. Refer to Cash Back for a description of how
the system can recommend Cash Back amount if the customer tendered more than they are paying.

**Match Type and Match Value are used if either of the following conditions is true:**

- This Payor Account belongs to an open item customer class. In this situation, specify a Match Type to define how the
payment should be matched to the customer's open-items and use Match Value to define the open-items covered by the
payment. For example, if this payment is in respect of a bill, specify a match type of "bill ID" and a match value of the
bill ID being paid.

**NOTE:**


-----

**Shortcut. If you enter a Match Type of "bill ID" and leave the Match Value blank, the system assumes the customer**
wants to pay the latest bill.

- The customer wants to restrict the distribution of the payment to a specific service agreement. In this situation, specify a
**Match Type of "service agreement ID" and a Match Value of the respective service agreement ID.**

The Payment Date defaults to the current date.

If the Payor Account ID's customer class is designated as non-CIS (i.e., the person making the payment isn't a customer),
the following information appears in the above window:

- **Non CIS Name is the name of the person remitting the payment.**

- **Reference Number is the reference number of the item being paid (e.g., the property tax reference number).**

- **Non CIS Comments are used to describe anything unusual about the non-CIS payment.**

Use Distribute Action to describe what you'd like to have happen when you click the OK button:

- Choose Distribute and Freeze if OK if this is a simple payment that should require no manual intervention. By "simple
payment" we mean:

  - The account is both the tendering account and the account whose debt is being relieved by the payment

  - The payment date is the current date

  - The payment should be distributed amongst the account's service agreements using standard distribution logic

- If this option is selected, the system distributes the Payment Amount amongst the account's service agreements. If the
distribution is successful, the system automatically freezes the payment. If the distribution is not successful, the payment
will be in the Error or Incomplete state. When the Payment Event page appears, you can view the error and then correct
it. After the cause of the error is corrected, you must distribute and freeze the payment manually (this can be done on
several pages including Payment Event - Main and Payment - Main).

- Choose Manual Distribution if you need to manually distribute the payment amongst the account's service agreements. If
this option is selected, the system creates a payment event, a tender and a payment and then transfers you to the Payment

  - Manual Distribution page where you can define the amount to be allocated to each of the account's service agreements.
After you've distributed the payment, don't forget to freeze it.

- Choose Do Not Distribute if you want to process the payment event manually (e.g., if you need to define multiple
accounts whose debt is relieved by the payment). If this option is selected, the Payment Event - Main page opens with
the information you entered defaulted accordingly. You can make any changes you want and then distribute and freeze
the payment. Refer to How To Add A New Payment Event for more information.

**NOTE:**
**Cash-only warning. If the account has exceeded your cash-only threshold and the Tender Type isn't marked as "like**
cash", a warning appears advising of such. Note, a customer's cash-only points are maintained on Account - Credit
Rating.

###### Add One-Time Payment

The Add One-Time Payment user interface allows for quick add of one-time payment events using any of the following:

- Stored payment methods from self-service one-time payments and wallet maintenance

- A currently effective account auto pay option for recurring bill automatic payments

- New checking or savings payment methods - subject to web debit account validation, if the bank account is being used
for the first time

- Cash


-----

- Non-cash, non-auto pay tender types - e.g., check

**NOTE:** The Add One-Time Payment user interface is an alternative for the Payment Event - Add Dialog. Refer to One
Time Payment Options for information on how to enable it.

When enabled, the Add One-Time Payment dialog can be launched from any of the following:

- **Take A Payment action from the Customer dashboard zone.**

- Main Menu: Menu > Financial > Payment Event > Add

- Account context menu: Payment Event > Add

In addition, the Add One-Time Payment script can also be called from other places (zones, maps, etc) in the system where
your implementation allows the capture of a one-time payment.

**NOTE:**
If you have opted to always use the payment event distribution rules method as your default method, the Payment Event
Quick Add (Single Payment Event) page appears instead.

The Payment Date defaults to the current date.

The Payor Account ID is the account that is tendering the payment. This is defaulted from the Account in context, if any.

**NOTE:**
**Cash-only warning. If the account has exceeded your cash-only threshold a message appears advising of such. A**
customer's cash-only points are maintained on the Account - Credit Rating page.

The Payment Amount is the amount of the customer's debt to be relieved by the payment. Note, this amount is defaulted
using an algorithm plugged in on the Installation Record. Please refer to the Automatic Payment Amount Calculation
algorithm, (C1-APAM-DFLT) for more information on the calculation.

The Tenders - Existing Payment Options grid is shown if the Payor Account has existing self-service payment methods
and/or a currently effective recurring bill auto pay enrollment. Select a Payment Option and specify the Tender Amount.

The Tenders - New Auto Pay Options and Other Tender Types grid is used for new automatic payment methods, cash
tender type(s) and other non-cash/non-auto pay tender types (e.g. check). Select a Tender Type and specify the applicable
information. A new checking/savings payment method can be saved, to make it available for future one-time payments,
including self-service payments. Specify the Tender Amount.

**NOTE:**
**Cash back causes an additional tender to be created. If cash should be returned to the customer (because the**
customer overpaid and the tender type's cash back allowed switch is true and the tender type is not "like cash"), a
negative tender for the cash back amount is created for the payment event. Refer to Cash Back for a description of how
the system can recommend Cash Back amount if the customer tendered more than they are paying.

**Credit card tender types are not supported. To ensure compliance with credit card processing rules, it is highly**
recommended that credit card payments be processed through a third-party payment processing system. If your
implementation needs to support credit card tender types in this dialog, you can create a custom BPA script to override
the base-owned BPA script. Refer to <xref? One Time Payment Options> for details.

**Match Type and Match Value are shown used if either of the following conditions is true:**

- The Payor Account belongs to an open item customer class. In this situation, specify a Match Type to define how the
payment should be matched to the customer's open-items and use Match Value to define the open-items covered by the
payment. For example, if this payment is in respect of a bill, specify a match type of "bill ID" and a match value of the
bill ID being paid.

**NOTE:**


-----

**Shortcut. If you enter a Match Type of "bill ID" and leave the Match Value blank, the system assumes the customer**
wants to pay the latest bill.

- The customer wants to restrict the distribution of the payment to a specific service agreement. In this situation, specify a
**Match Type of "service agreement ID" and a Match Value of the respective service agreement ID.**

If the Payor Account ID's customer class is designated as non-CIS (i.e., the person making the payment isn't a customer),
the following information appears in the above window:

- **Non CIS Name is the name of the person remitting the payment.**

- **Reference Number is the reference number of the item being paid (e.g., the property tax reference number).**

- **Non CIS Comments are used to describe anything unusual about the non-CIS payment.**

Use Distribute Action to describe what you'd like to have happen when you click the OK button:

- Choose Distribute and Freeze if OK if this is a simple payment that should require no manual intervention. "Simple
payment" means:

  - The account is both the tendering account and the account whose debt is being relieved by the payment

  - The payment date is the current date

  - The payment should be distributed amongst the account's service agreements using standard distribution logic

If this option is selected, the system distributes the Payment Amount amongst the account's service agreements. If the
distribution is successful, the system automatically freezes the payment. If the distribution is not successful or is on
hold due to web debit account validation, the payment will be in the Error or Incomplete state, respectively. When the
Payment Event page appears, you can view the error and then correct it. After the cause of the error is corrected, you
must distribute and freeze the payment manually (this can be done on several pages including Payment Event - Main and
Payment - Main). If any new auto pay methods are checking/savings bank accounts that have never been used on prior
recurring auto pays and/or prior self-service one-time payments, the bank accounts will be subject to web debit account
validation if the system is configured to do so. The One-Time Payment service task is created to manage bank account
validation. The service task is linked to the payment event, which remains in Incomplete status until the validation is
complete. The service task will either complete or delete the payment event, depending on the validation results. Refer to
Web Debit Account Validation for more details.

- Choose Manual Distribution if you need to manually distribute the payment amongst the account's service agreements
or if you want to process the payment event manually (e.g. if you need to define multiple payee accounts). If this option
is selected, the system creates a payment event, a tender and a payment and then transfers you to the Payment - Manual
Distribution page where you can define the amount to be allocated to each of the account's service agreements. After
you've distributed the payment, don't forget to freeze it. If allocating the payment to multiple payee accounts, navigate to
the Payment Event - Main page and make any changes before distributing and freezing the payment.

###### Payment Event - Main Information

The Main page contains core payment event information. Open this page using Menu > Financial > Payment Event >
**Search.**

**FASTPATH:**
The Description of Page section below describes the fields on this page. Refer to How To for a description of how to
perform common payment event maintenance functions.

**Description of Page**

**NOTE:**


-----

**Cash-only customers. When you attempt to add a new payment event, the system warns you if the account remitting**
the tender is a cash-only customer and the tender's tender type is not cash. An account is considered cash-only if their
current cash-only points exceed the cash-only threshold maintained on the Installation record or account’s CIS Division.
A customer's cash-only points are maintained on Account - Credit Rating.

**Pay Event Info contains a concatenation of the payment date, amount, and the name of the main customer on the account**
that remits the tender. If multiple tenders exist, the customer's name is not displayed. If the payment event is associated with
a single distribution detail, the rule name and the description of the rule value are displayed as well. If multiple distribution
details exist, Multiple Distribution Details Exist is displayed instead. If document numbering has been enabled, the assigned
document number will appear. If the payment was made in an alternate currency, the message Alternate Currency Used is
displayed. Pay Event Info is only displayed after the payment event has been added to the database.

Refer to Alternate Currency Payments and Document Numbers for more information. Payment Event ID is the systemassigned unique identifier of the payment event.

The area under Pay Event Info provides warnings about the payment event. Possible warnings are Unfrozen Payments and
The Payment Event is Unbalanced. A warning is also issued to the cashier to remind them to turn in funds - see Turn Ins.

If multiple distribution details are linked to the payment event, the distribution rule, value, and amount for each distribution
detail displays.

**Payment Date is the business date associated with the payment event.**

**WARNING:**
If you change the payment date and this event's tender(s) are automatic payments, the extract date (i.e., the date the
automatic payment is sent to the financial institution) will be changed to equal the payment date. Refer to Automatic
Paymentsfor more information.

**Payment(s) contains the total number and value of payments linked to the event.**

**Tender(s) contains the total number and value of tenders linked to the event.**

**Amount Tendered contains the amount that was tendered by the customer.**

The system displays a Cash Back Amount if the customer tenders more than they are paying (refer to Cash Back for
details).

If the payment event becomes unbalanced, a Recalculate Cash Back button appears. If this button is clicked, the system
creates, deletes or recalculates the cash back tender. Refer to Cash Back for details.

While most payment events contain a single payment, the system allows many payments to exist under a payment event
(when the payment event's tender(s) are distributed amongst multiple accounts). If a payment event has a large number of
payments, you can use the Account Filter to limit the payments that appear in the Payments grid. The following options
are available:

- Account. Use this option if you only want to see the payment linked to an Account ID.

- All. Use this option to view all payments linked to the payment event.

- Person Name. Use this option to restrict payments linked to accounts whose main customer has a primary name that
matches Person Name.

The Payments grid contains the payment(s) linked to the payment event. The following points describe the attributes in this
scroll; refer to How To for instructions describing how to perform common maintenance activities.

- **Account ID references the payment's account. The name of the account's main customer is displayed adjacent.**

- **Payment Amount is the amount of the account's debt relieved by the payment. The adjacent context menu allows you to**
drill down to the details of the payment (this is where you can see the payment's payment segments and where you can
override the distribution of the payment).


-----

- **Payment Status is the payment's status. If the payment's status is Error, the error message is displayed adjacent. Refer to**
Payment Lifecycle for the potential values and how to handle a payment when it exists in a given state.

- **Match Type and Match Value should only be used if either of the following conditions is true:**

  - This Account ID belongs to an open item customer class. In this situation, specify a Match Type to define how the
payment should be matched to the customer's open-items and use Match Value to define the open-items covered by
the payment. For example, if this payment is in respect of a bill, specify a match type of "bill id" and a match value of
the bill id being paid.

  - The customer wants to restrict the distribution of the payment to a specific service agreement. In this situation, specify
a Match Type of "service agreement ID" and a Match Value of the respective service agreement ID.

- The remaining columns are only used if the payment is linked to an Account ID that belongs to a customer class that is
used for non-CIS payments. Refer to Setting Up Customer Classes for more information. If such an account exists, the
following fields must be defined.

  - **Non CIS Name is the name of the person remitting the payment.**

  - **Reference Number is the reference number of the item being paid (e.g., the property tax reference number).**

  - **Non CIS Comments are used to describe anything unusual about the non-CIS payment.**

- Note, you can also define a comment for a non-CIS payment. To define a comment, use the context menu adjacent to
**Payment Amount to drill to Payment - Main.**

- **Payment ID is the unique, system-assigned identifier of the payment. This value only appears after the payment has**
been added to the database.

- **Tender Type describes what was remitted (e.g., cash, check). If the Tender Type is associated with an automatic**
payment, the page displays a section that includes information about how and when the automatic payment was
interfaced to the payment source.

**NOTE:**
**Authorizing Tenders. The Tender Type dropdown list does not include tender types that require authorization (i.e.**
credit card payments).

**FASTPATH:**
**For information about tender types requiring authorization, refer to Credit Card Payments.**

- If the payment tender was remitted in an alternate currency, i.e. a currency other than the payor account's currency,
**Alternate Currency and Exchange Rate will display the formatted alternate amount ((includes the alternate amount and**
currency) and the exchange rate that was in effect on the payment date.

**FASTPATH:**
**For information about accepting payments in alternate currencies, refer to Alternate Currency Payments.**

- **Tender Status is the tender's status. Refer to Tender Lifecycle for the potential values and how to handle a tender when**
it exists in a given state.

- If the Tender Type is associated with an automatic payment, the system attempts to default automatic payment
information from the account's auto-pay option if the tender type is the same as the tender type on the account's autopay source and if the auto pay option is effective on the payment date. If the system is unable to default information, you
must specify the source of the funds and the customer's account number / credit card number at the financial institution.
You can override automatic payment information as long as the automatic payment has not been sent to the financial
institution or cancelled. The Auto Pay Section contains the following fields:

  - **Auto Pay Source is the financial institution / credit card company that receives the automatic payment request.**

  - **Scheduled Extract Date is the date the automatic payment request was sent / is scheduled to be sent to the financial**
institution. This information is display-only.

system to encrypt External Account ID, the data will be displayed with a masked value; such as, *******.Refer to
Encrypting Sensitive Data for more information.

  - **Expires On is only needed if the Tender Type indicates that an expiration date is necessary (e.g., for a credit card**
payment).

  - **Name is the customer's name in the financial institution's system.**

  - **Bill ID is the ID of the bill whose completion caused the creation of the automatic payment. This information only**
appears if the automatic payment was created as a result of a bill. This information is display-only.

- If the payment was uploaded, the following fields MAY contain information (if they were populated in the interface file):

  - **MICR ID is the value of the magnetic ink character recognition (MICR) line on the payment.**

**NOTE:** The system supports encryption for MICR ID. If your implementation has configured the system to
encrypt MICR ID, the data will be displayed with a masked value; such as, *******.Refer to Encrypting Sensitive
Data for more information.

  - **Customer ID is the customer's account ID that appeared on the interfaced payment.**

  - **Ext. Reference ID is the unique identifier of the payment upload interface record.**

  - **Name is the customer's name on the interfaced payment record.**

- In the Tender Control area, the Tender Control ID is the identity of the remittance processor batch or cash drawer
bundle in which the tender was remitted. Refer to Tender Management and Workstation Cashiering for more information
about tender controls.

- Displayed adjacent to Tender Control is the date, tender source, and status of the tender control.

Every new tender must reference an open tender control. The system will attempt to default an appropriate tender control as
follows:

- If the user has at least one open, user-specific Tender Control, the system will default one, at random.

- If the user has no open, user-specific Tender Controls; the system will default an open, "all users" tender control if it can
find one whose tender source indicates it's used for online cashiering. If multiple exist, one will be selected at random.

- Turn off Included in Tender Ctl Balance if the tender should not be included in the tender amount in the tender
control's tender balance. You would turn this switch off if you canceled a tender because it was mistakenly applied to the
wrong account (or the amount was wrong). This switch is only enabled if:

  - The tender control isn't balanced.

  - The tender is canceled.

- **Deposit Control contains a concatenation of the tender control's deposit control's creation date, tender source type, and**
status. Refer to Tender Management and Workstation Cashiering for more information about deposit controls.

- The Tender Action area contains a button that you use to cancel a tender. Refer to Tender Actions for information about
this button. Refer to How To Cancel A Tender for more information.

The Characteristics collection on the Tenders page contains information that describes miscellaneous information about
the tender. The following fields display:

**Characteristic Type Indicate the type of characteristic.**

**Sequence Controls the order in which characteristics of the same type are displayed.**

**Characteristic Value Indicate the value of the characteristic.**


-----

###### Payment Event - Characteristics

To update payment event characteristics, open Menu > Financial > Payment Event > Search and navigate to the
**Characteristics page.**

**Description of Page**

The Characteristics collection contains information that describes miscellaneous information about the payment event.

The following fields display:

**Characteristic Type Indicate the type of characteristic.**

**Sequence Controls the order in which characteristics of the same type are displayed.**

**Characteristic Value Indicate the value of the characteristic.**

###### Exception

The topics in this section describe exceptions that are detected when the system allocates a payment.

###### Payment Event Exception

It is possible for a payment event's tenders to not equal its payments. Such events are classified as unbalanced. For each
unbalanced payment event, a record is written to the Payment Event Exception table (CI_PAY_EVT_EXCP). A To Do
background process creates To Do entries for records in this table.

Unbalanced payment events cause a record to be written to the payment event exception table with a message indicating the
nature of the error.

To view the messages associated with the exception records, schedule the TD-UNBAL background process. This process
generates a To Do entry for every record in the payment event exception table.

**FASTPATH:**
Refer to Unbalanced Payment Events for instructions describing how to correct an unbalanced payment event.

###### Payment Exception

When the system is unable to distribute a payment, a record to be written to the payment exception table with a message
indicating the nature of the error. A common example of a payment exception is no service agreement to hold a credit.
This can occur when an account overpays their debt and the account doesn't have a single service agreement that is allowed
to hold a credit, a payment error is generated.

The system saves payments that are in error just as it saves payments that are error-free. This is done because payments are
nothing more than a snapshot of the data that was used to distribute the payment. By saving the snapshot, you can see the
information the system used when it detected the error and therefore more effectively correct it.

Every payment in error is written to the Payment Exception table (CI_PAY_EXCP). A To Do background process creates
To Do entries for records in this table.

To view the messages associated with the exception records, schedule the TD-PYERR background process. This process
generates a To Do entry for every record in the payment exception table.


-----

After correcting the cause of the error, drill into the Payment and attempt to redistribute it.

###### Resolving Exceptions Automatically

Some payment errors occur because master data was not fully set up prior to receiving a payment for the account. For
these cases, the system will periodically check to see whether the master data problem has been resolved by attempting to
distribute and freeze the payment in error.

A background process, Resolve Payments in Error - PY-RPE, exists for this purpose. This background process works as
follows:

- It looks for payments in error where the error was caused by the lack of active service agreements linked to the payment's
account. Note, this may occur when a customer is verbally asked to pay a connection fee or deposit prior to starting
service, and for some reason, the appropriate service agreement has not been set up yet, or is still pending.

- For each such payment, it attempts to re-distribute the payment. If service agreements have been created in the
meantime, this payment will distribute and freeze successfully.

###### Payment Event Action Codes

The topics that follow describe each of the actions that appear on the payment event pages.

###### Payment Actions

The topics that follow describe payment-oriented actions. Refer to How To for a description of several business processes
that use these buttons.

###### Distribute (Payments)

Clicking the Distribute button distributes all Incomplete, Error, or Freezable payments linked to the event. Refer to
Distribute (A Payment) for information of how a single payment is distributed.

This button is enabled if at least one payment is Incomplete, Error, or Freezable.

###### Redistribute (Payments)

Clicking the Redistribute button redistributes all Incomplete, Error, or Freezable payments linked to the event. Refer to
Redistribute (A Payment) for information of how a single payment is redistributed.

This button is enabled if at least one payment is Incomplete, Error, or Freezable.

###### Print

The Print button is enabled under the following conditions:

- The payment event must have at least one payment that is Frozen and no payments that are Incomplete, Error or
Freezable.


-----

- A processing script is configured in the Point Of Sale (POS) Printer Integration master configuration.

  - For the Payment Event page, a POS Printing - Payment Event BPA script should be configured.

  - For the Payment Event Quick Add page, a POS Printing - Payment Event Quick Add BPA script should be
configured.

  - For the Payment Quick Add page, a POS Printing - Payment Quick Add BPA script should be configured.

Refer to How To Print Receipts And Endorsements for more information.

###### Freeze (Payments)

Clicking the Freeze button causes all Freezable payments linked to the event to become frozen. Refer to Freeze (A
Payment) for information of how a single payment is frozen.

This button is enabled if at least one payment is Freezable.

**NOTE:**
**If problems are detected after freezing. A payment may not be changed after it is frozen. All subsequent changes must**
occur by canceling the frozen payment and creating a new one. You can cancel and redistribute a payment on the next
tab. Refer to Canceling A Tender Versus Canceling a Payment for more information.

###### Payment Event Actions

The topics that follow describe payment event-oriented actions. Refer to How To for a description of typical business
processes that use these buttons.

###### Transfer

If the payment event was created using distribution rule(s), any transfer of its payments should also be done using the
distribution rules method. Hence, a different dialog opens when you click Transfer based on whether the payment event is
associated with at least one distribution detail or not.

**Transfer (No Distribution Details Exist)**

The Transfer button is enabled if:

- There is a single non-cancelled tender linked to the event AND

- There is a single frozen payment linked to the event AND

- The account on the tender is the same as the account on the payment.

When clicked, the Payment Event Transfer dialog opens.

You must specify the following parameters in the Payment Event Transfer dialog to transfer a payment:

- **Account ID is the account to which the payment event should be transferred.**

- **Cancel Reason defines why you are performing the transfer.**

- **Match Type and Match Value are defaulted based on their values for the payment event that you are transferring. If**
necessary, modify the values appropriately for the account to which you are transferring the payment event. Match Type
and Match Value are used for an account that belongs to an open item customer class or to restrict the distribution of the
payment to a specific service agreement. Refer to Payment Event - Main for more information.


-----

- Turn on Freeze Payment if the transferred payment should be frozen automatically. You may want to leave this turned
off if you want to examine the payment distribution before freezing the payment.

- **Non CIS Name, Reference Number, and Non CIS Comments appear if the Account ID belongs to a customer class**
that is used for non-CIS payments. Refer to Setting Up Customer Classes for more information.

Clicking OK causes the following to take place:

- The account on the tender is changed to reflect the transfer to account.

- The original payment and its segments are cancelled.

- A new payment is added for the transfer to account. The payment characteristics associated with the original payment are
copied to the new payment.

- The new payment is distributed.

- If so designated, the new payment is frozen.

**Transfer (Distribution Details Exist)**

The Transfer button is enabled if:

- There is a single payor AND

- All existing payees before the transfer are the same as the payor AND

- There is at least a single non-cancelled tender linked to the event

When clicked, the Payment Event Transfer dialog opens.

You must specify the following parameters in this dialog to transfer payment(s):

- **Distribution Rule is the account to which the payment event should be transferred.**

- **Rule Value is the value associated with the payment and expected by the distribution rule.**

- **Amount is the payment amount.**

- **Cancel Reason defines why you are performing the transfer.**

Clicking OK causes the following to take place:

- The payment(s) associated with the original account are canceled.

- The new set of distribution details are processes, creating new payment(s) for the transfer to account. The payment
characteristics associated with the original payment are copied to the new payment.

- If all new payments are for the same payee account (and the payee is different than the current payor) the account on the
tender is changed to reflect the transfer to account.

- Original distribution details (only those with a non-zero amount) are deleted and replaced by the new set of details on the
payment event.

**NOTE:**
**Distribution rule entries can have a zero amount. Refer to Rule Value Can Capture Additional Information for more**
information about how to use distribution details to capture additional payment related information.

**Determine Tender Account. This dialog does not call the Determine Tender Account algorithm defined on distribution**
rule as this action does not rebuild the payment tender collection.

**FASTPATH:**
Refer to Rule Value Can Capture Additional Information for more information about how to use distribution details to
capture additional payment related information.

###### Delete A Payment Event

The Delete button deletes a payment event and its tenders and payments.

This button is enabled if there are no frozen or canceled payments and no canceled tenders.

###### Tender Actions

The topics that follow describe tender-oriented actions. Refer to How To for a description of several business processes that
use these buttons.

###### Cancel A Tender

Clicking Cancel causes the following to take place:

- All payments associated with the tender's payment event are canceled.

- The tender becomes canceled.

- If the cancellation reason indicates the cancellation is due to non-sufficient funds, other actions may occur. Refer to NSF
Cancellations for more information.

The Cancel button is enabled if the tender is not canceled

When clicked, the Tender Cancel window opens.

You must specify the following parameters to cancel a tender:

- Select a Cancel Reason to describe why the tender is being canceled.

- The system also needs to know which Bank Account To Charge the cancellation against. The system will default the
**Bank and Bank Account Key from the original bank information used when the tender was deposited. You can override**
them here.

When you click the OK button, the system cancels the tender and ALL payments linked to the event.

**NOTE:**
**When non-canceled tenders are still linked to the event. If there are multiple tenders linked to the payment event, you**
must either add new payment(s) that equal the sum of the event's non-canceled tenders or cancel the remaining tenders.

**Cancellation after cash back. If a customer tenders a check for $100, but only owes $80, the system will recommend**
returning $20 in cash to the customer (assuming the tender type for checks allows overpayment). If the tender type for
checks is not "like cash", a second tender is created for -$20 (the first tender is for $100). If the check subsequently
bounces, both tenders must be cancelled.

##### Payment Event Quick Add

The Payment Event Quick Add page is used to quickly add, distribute and freeze one or more payment events using
distribution rules. Open this page using Menu > Financial > Payment Event Quick Add > Search.

**Description of Page**


-----

Specify the Tender Control ID in which the tenders will be recorded. Every new tender must reference an open tender
control. The system will attempt to default an appropriate tender control as follows:

- If the user has at least one open, user-specific Tender Control whose type is online cashiering or ad hoc, the system will
default one, at random.

- If the user has no open, user-specific Tender Controls; the system will default an open, "all users" tender control if it
can find one whose tender source has a tender source type of online cashiering or ad hoc. If multiple exist, one will be
selected at random.

Specify the Payment Date. The current date defaults.

Use Number of Payment Events to indicate whether you intend to add a single payment event or multiple payment events.

Choose the multiple payment events option if you intend to add "simple" payment events. By "simple" we mean:

- A single account is both the payor account and the account whose debt is being relieved by the payment.

- The payment tender is not an auto-pay tender.

For all other cases choose the single payment event dialogue as it is designed to handle more complex payment event
configurations such as when:

- The payor account is different than the payee account.

- Multiple payors cover payments for one or more payees.

- The payment tender is an auto-pay tender.

Once you have made your selection the page is adjusted to support the corresponding dialog.

**NOTE:**
**Cash-Only customers. When you attempt to add a new payment event, the system warns you if the account remitting**
the tender is a cash-only customer. An account is considered cash-only if their current cash-only points exceed the cashonly threshold maintained on the Installation record or the account’s CIS Division. A customer’s cash-only points are
maintained on Account - Credit Rating.

###### Multiple Payment Events Dialog

This section describes the default dialog setup when navigating from Menu > Financial > Payment Event Quick Add

**Description of Page**

Using the multiple payment events option, each row in the payment detail grid typically represents a unique distribution
detail. However, more than one row in the grid can belong to a single payment event. All distribution details for identical
tender account will be grouped under a single pay event.

The following columns appear in the Payments grid:

- Select a Distribution Rule by which the payment detail is to be processed. If you have set up a default distribution rule,
it is defaulted in the first row.

- Specify the Rule Value associated with the payment and expected by the distribution rule.

- Use Payment Amount to define the amount of the payment.

- Use Tender Type to define the form or remittance (e.g., cash, check, etc.). Note that the Tender Type defaults from the
installation record.

**NOTE:**


-----

**Authorizing Tenders. The Tender Type dropdown list does not include tender types that require authorization (i.e.**
credit card payments).

**FASTPATH:**
**For information about tender types requiring authorization, refer to Credit Card Payments.**

**NOTE:**
**Automatic Payments. The multiple payment events dialog does not support automatic payments. Switch to the single**
payment event dialog to enter automatic payments.

- Use Check Number if a check is remitted.

- **MICR ID is the value of the magnetic ink character recognition (MICR) line on the payment.**

**NOTE:** The system supports encryption for MICR ID. If your implementation has configured the system to encrypt
MICR ID, the data will be displayed with a masked value; such as, *******.Refer to Encrypting Sensitive Data for
more information.

- You may use Customer ID to record additional customer information.

- You may use External Reference ID to record external information associated with the payment tender.

- You may use Name to record additional payment tender information.

- **MICR ID is the MICR ID associated with the tender.**

- **Payor Account ID is the tender account as determined by the Determine Tender Account algorithm defined on the**
distribution rule. This information is only populated after the distribution detail has been processed.

After specifying the various payment distribution details in the grid, click Create. The system attempts to create payment
event(s) as follows:

- As mentioned earlier, all distribution details for identical tender accounts are grouped under a single pay event. The first
step in identifying common tenders is to determine the tender account. To do that the system calls the Determine Tender
Account algorithm defined on the distribution rule.

- A payment event is created for each unique tender account.

- All rows having all attributes of the tender identical except for the amount are grouped together where each group
represents a single tender.

- A single payment tender is created for each unique tender and linked to the payment event.

- The total payment amount for each distinct group of distribution details (for the payment event) having the same rule and
value is summarized. For each distinct group, the system calls the Create Payment algorithm defined on the distribution
rule providing it with the rule value and total payment amount. It is the responsibility of this algorithm to create the
payments for this payment event.

- Add the distinct payment event distribution detail and its total amount beneath the payment event.

- If your implementation is configured for printing at a cashier station, the Print dialog appears. Refer to How To Print
Receipts and Endorsements for more details.

The Payment Event ID column appears in the grid after the distribution details have been processed. It shows the payment
event ID created for the distribution detail record and a short description as to the status of the payment(s) created for the
payment event. You can use this field to navigate to the payment event.

After you've added a group of payment events, you should press the clear button (or Alt-C), to ready the page for the next
group of payment event details.


-----

###### Single Payment Event Dialog

If you have opted to always use the payment event distribution rules method as your default method, this section describes
the default dialog setup when you navigate to the Payment Event page in Add mode.

Adding a single payment event at a time, allows for more complex payment event information to be captured.

Enter one row in the Tenders grid for every unique tender associated with the payment event.

- **Payor Account ID references the tendering account. The name of the account's main customer is displayed adjacent. If**
the account has exceeded your cash-only threshold, the warning Cash-Only appears.

**WARNING:**
If you change the Payor Account ID and the tender has an associated automatic payment request, the automatic payment
request will be removed. A new automatic payment request will be created for the new Payor Account ID. Refer to
Automatic Paymentsfor more information.

- **Tender Amount is the amount of the tender.**

- Use Tender Type to define the form or remittance (e.g., cash, check, etc.). Note, the Tender Type defaults from the
installation record.

- Use Check Number if a check is remitted.

- **MICR ID is the value of the magnetic ink character recognition (MICR) line on the payment.**

**NOTE:** The system supports encryption for MICR ID. If your implementation has configured the system to encrypt
MICR ID, the data will be displayed with a masked value; such as, *******.Refer to Encrypting Sensitive Data for
more information.

- You may use Customer ID to record additional customer information.

- You may use External Reference ID to record external information associated with the payment tender.

- You may use Name to record additional payment tender information.

- If the Tender Type is associated with an automatic payment, the page displays a section that includes information about
how and when the automatic payment was interfaced to the payment source.

- If the Tender Type is associated with an automatic payment, the system attempts to default automatic payment
information from the account's auto-pay option if the tender type is the same as the tender type on the account's autopay source and if the auto pay option is effective on the payment date. If the system is unable to default information, you
must specify the source of the funds and the customer's account number / credit card number at the financial institution.

  - **Auto Pay Source is the financial institution / credit card company that receives the automatic payment request.**

  - **External Account ID is the customer's account number at the financial institution.**

  - **Expires On is only needed if the Tender Type indicates that an expiration date is necessary (e.g., for a credit card**
payment).

  - **Name is the customer's name in the financial institution's system.**

The following columns appear in the Payments grid:

- Select a Distribution Rule by which the payment detail is to be processed. If you have set up a default distribution rule,
it is defaulted in the first row.

- Specify the Rule Value associated with the payment and expected by the distribution rule.

- Use Payment Amount to define the amount of the payment.


-----

After specifying the various payment distribution details in the grid, click Create.

**NOTE:**
**Go To Payment Event. If you wish to be transferred to the payment event page once processing is complete, remember**
to check the Go To Payment Event check box before you click Create. This field does not appear when this page is used
as the default Payment Event - Add Dialog and you are automatically transferred to the payment event page once the
payment event is created.

After distribution details have been processed, a short description of the payment event that has been created is displayed to
the right of the Go To Payment Event field. The description provides information as to the status of the payment(s) created
for the payment event. You can use this field to navigate to the payment event.

The system attempts to create the payment event as follows:

- Validate that the sum of the tenders is not less than the sum of the payments.

- Create the payment event with a separate payment tender for each row in the Tenders grid.

- Summarize the total payment amount for each distinct group of distribution details having the same rule and value. For
each distinct group, call the Create Payment algorithm defined on the distribution rule providing it with the rule value
and total payment amount. It is the responsibility of this algorithm to create the payments for the payment event.

- Add the distinct payment event distribution detail summary beneath the payment event.

- If your implementation is configured for printing at a cashier station, the Print dialog appears. Refer to How To Print
Receipts and Endorsements for more details.

**NOTE:**
**Determine Tender Account. Having an explicit collection of tenders eliminate the need to determine the tender**
account. Therefore this dialog does not call the Determine Tender Account algorithm.

##### Payment Quick Add

The Payment Quick Add page is used to quickly add, distribute and freeze payment events for up to fifteen accounts. Open
this page using Menu > Financial > Payment Quick Add.

**Description of Page**

Specify the Tender Control ID in which the tenders will be recorded. Every new tender must reference an open tender
control. The system will attempt to default an appropriate tender control as follows:

- If the user has at least one open, user-specific Tender Control whose type is online cashiering or ad hoc, the system will
default one, at random.

- If the user has no open, user-specific Tender Controls; the system will default an open, "all users" tender control if it
can find one whose tender source has a tender source type of online cashiering or ad hoc. If multiple exist, one will be
selected at random.

Specify the Payment Date. The current date defaults.

Enter one row in the grid for every payment event to be added. The following information is entered for each payment
event:

- Use Account ID to define the customer who tendered the payment. It's important to note that this transaction assumes
that the tendering account is the same as the account whose balance is relieved by the payment. Refer to How To
Allocate The Tender Amount To Multiple Accounts if you need to distribute the payment to an account (or accounts)
other than the tendering account.

**NOTE:**


-----

**Cash-Only customers. You cannot use this transaction to add a payment for a "cash-only" account if the tender type**
is not "like cash". An account is considered cash-only if its cash-only points exceed the cash-only threshold maintained
on the Installation record. A customer's cash-only points are maintained on Account - Credit Rating. You must use the
Payment Event transaction to add such a payment (note, if you use the Account context menu to transfer to the Payment
Event page in add mode, you won't have to retype the Account ID when you add the payment event).

- Use Payment Amount to define the amount of the payment.

- Use Tender Type to define the form or remittance (e.g., cash, check, etc.). Note, the Tender Type defaults from the
installation record.

**NOTE:**
**Authorizing Tenders. The Tender Type dropdown list does not include tender types that require authorization (i.e.**
credit card payments).

**FASTPATH:**
**For information about tender types requiring authorization, refer to Credit Card Payments.**

- Use Check Number if a check is remitted.

- **Match Type and Match Value are only used if either of the following conditions is true:**

  - This Account ID belongs to an open item customer class. In this situation, specify a Match Type to define how the
payment should be matched to the customer's open-items and use Match Value to define the open-items covered by
the payment. For example, if this payment is in respect of a bill, specify a match type of "bill id" and a match value of
the bill id being paid.

**NOTE:**
**Shortcut. If you enter a Match Type of "bill id" and leave the Match Value blank, we assume the customer wants to**
pay the latest bill.

- The customer wants to restrict the distribution of the payment to a specific service agreement. In this situation, specify a
**Match Type of "service agreement ID" and a Match Value of the respective service agreement ID.**

After specifying the various accounts and amounts in the grid, click the Distribute and Freeze button. When you click this
button, the system attempts to create a payment event for each row in the grid. Four potential outcomes are possible for each
row:

- If the data you entered for a payment event isn't complete (e.g., you don't specify a valid account or amount):

  - No payment event is created.

  - A Message describing the problem is displayed.

  - All fields on the row remain modifiable.

- You should correct each such line and then press the Distribute and Freeze button.

- If the data you entered is complete, but the system issues a warning (e.g., the account is considered "cash-only" and a
tender type other than cash is remitted, or if the account already has a payment for this amount on this date):

  - No payment event is created.

  - A Message containing the warning is displayed.

  - All fields on the row remain modifiable.

- You must clear the line and add a payment using the Payment Event transaction (note, if you use the Account context
menu to transfer to the Payment Event page in add mode, you won't have to retype the Account ID when you add the
payment event).


-----

- If the data you entered is complete, but the system is not successful in distributing the payment:

  - The system creates a payment event, a payment and a tender.

  - A Message describing the problem is displayed.

  - The payment's Status is displayed

  - All fields on the row are disabled.

- You must press the adjacent go to button to drill to the payment event where the error can be corrected.

- If the data you entered is complete and the system is successful in distributing the payment:

  - The system creates a payment event, a payment, and a tender.

  - The system distributes the payment amongst the account's service agreements and then freezes the payment.

  - The payment's Status is displayed.

  - All fields on the row are disabled.

  - If your implementation is configured for printing at a cashier station, the Print dialog appears. Refer to How To Print
Receipts and Endorsements for more details.

- You can press the adjacent go to button to view a payment event.

**NOTE:**
**Separate Commits. This page is unusual in that each payment event is committed to the database independently. For**
example, if you enter seven payment events and one is invalid, six payment events will be added to the database when
you press Distribute and Freeze. When the page is redisplayed, the rows containing the valid payments are protected
and an indication of their validity is displayed. The row containing the invalid payment remains unprotected. You can
correct the erroneous payment and then press the Distribute and Freeze button again.

After you've added a group of payments, you should press the clear button (or Alt-C), to ready the page for the next group
of payment events.

##### Maintaining Payments

Payments and payment segments are automatically created by the system when payment events are created. You should
only need to access this transaction as follows:

- To view a payment's payment segments (i.e., to view how a payment was distributed amongst its account's service
agreements).

- To override the distribution of a payment amongst its account's service agreements. Refer to Distributing A Payment
Amongst An Account's Service Agreements for information describing how payments are typically distributed.

The topics in this section describe how to maintain a payment.

###### Payment - Main

This page contains basic information about a payment. Open this page using Menu > Financial > Payment > Search.

**WARNING:**
Most payments are maintained using the Payment Event page. The transaction described below is typically only used to
view a payment's payment segments and to manually distribute a payment amongst an account's service agreements.


-----

**FASTPATH:**
The Description of Page section below describes the fields on this page. Refer to How To for instructions on how to
perform common maintenance functions.

**Description of Page**

**Payment Info contains a concatenation of the payment date, amount, status, and the name of the main customer on the**
account.

**Payment ID is the system-assigned unique identifier of the payment.**

**Payment Event ID is the system-assigned unique identifier of the payment event. The adjacent info contains a**
concatenation of the payment date, amount, and the name of the main customer on the account that remits the event's tender.
If multiple tenders exist, the customer's name is not displayed. A warning may also be displayed. The possible warnings are
Unfrozen Payments and The Payment Event is unbalanced.

**Payment(s) contains the total number and value of payments linked to the payment event.**

**Tender(s) contains the total number and value of tenders linked to the payment event.**

**Account ID is the account whose debt is reduced by the payment. The name of the account's main customer is displayed**
adjacent. This field is gray after the payment is frozen.

**Payment Amount is the amount of the payment. This field is gray after the payment is frozen. If the account has exceeded**
your cash-only threshold, a warning (in red) appears adjacent to Payment Amount. Note, a customer's cash-only points are
maintained on Account - Credit Rating.

**Payment Status is the payment's status. Refer to Payment Lifecycle for the potential values and how to handle a payment**
when it exists in a given state. If the payment is in Error, the error message is displayed adjacent. If the payment is
canceled, the Cancel Reason is displayed adjacent.

**Match Type and Match Value will only be used if either of the following conditions is true:**

- This Account ID belongs to an open item customer class. In this situation, specify a Match Type to define how the
payment should be matched to the customer's open-items and use Match Value to define the open-items covered by the
payment. For example, if this payment is in respect of a bill, specify a match type of "bill id" and a match value of the
bill id being paid.

- The customer wants to restrict the distribution of the payment to a specific service agreement. In this situation, specify a
**Match Type of "service agreement ID" and a Match Value of the respective service agreement ID.**

**Match Type and Match Value are gray after the payment is frozen.**

If the payment is linked to an Account ID that belongs to a customer class that is used for non-CIS payments, the following
fields appear (note, these fields are gray after the payment is frozen):

- **Name is the name of the person remitting the payment.**

- **Reference Number is the reference number of the item being paid (e.g., the property tax reference number).**

- **Comments are used to describe anything unusual about the non-CIS payment.**

The contents of the Payment Segments section depends on the number of payment segments linked to the payment. If more
than 25 payment segments exist, a message appears that allows you to navigate to Payment - Payment Segments where you
can view the payment segments (this page has special functionality that allows you to defined which payment segments
should be displayed). If 25 or fewer payment segments exist, the grid contains information about each payment segment:

- **Premise is the address of the service agreement's main premise.**

- **SA Information contains basic information about the service agreement.**

- **Distributed Amt is the amount of the service agreement's debt relieved by the payment.**

The following information appears at the bottom of the page:

- **Payment Amount is the amount of the payment.**


-----

- **Distributed Amount is the sum of the payment segments linked to the payment.**

- The Difference between the Payment Amount and the Distributed Amount appears if it is non-zero.

- **Billed Amount is the amount of the bill preceding the payment date.**

- **Delinquent Amount is the amount of the customer's debt that was due on / before the prior bill's due date.**

- **Current Balance is the account's current balance.**

Refer to Payment Action Codes for information about the action buttons on this page.

###### Payment - Pay Segments

You can use this page to view all or selected payment segments linked to a payment.

Open Menu > Financial > Payment > Search and navigate to the Payment Segments page to view this information.

**WARNING:**
Most payments are maintained using the Payment Event page. The transaction described below is typically only used to
view a payment's payment segments.

**NOTE:**
If the payment has more than 25 payment segments, the search criteria are intentionally left blank in order to avoid
retrieving all payment segments (with the resultant slow response times). You must therefore use the SA Filter to define
the type of payment segments that should be retrieved. See the Description of page below for more information about
this page's search criteria.

**Description of page**

**Payment Info contains a concatenation of important information about the payment.**

**Payment ID is the system-assigned unique identifier of the payment.**

**Payment Event ID is the system-assigned unique identifier of the payment event. The adjacent info contains a**
concatenation of the payment date, amount, and the name of the main customer on the account that remits the event's tender.
If multiple tenders exist, the customer's name is not displayed. A warning may also be displayed. The possible warnings are
Unfrozen Payments and The Payment Event is unbalanced.

**Payment(s) contains the total number and value of payments linked to the payment event.**

**Tender(s) contains the total number and value of tenders linked to the payment event.**

**NOTE:**
If the payment has more than 25 payment segments, the search criteria are intentionally left blank in order to avoid
retrieving all payment segments (with the resultant slow response times). You must therefore use the SA Filter to define
the type of payment segments that should be retrieved.

Use the SA Filter to define the types of service agreements whose payment segments appear in the grid. The following
options are available:

- Address. Use this option to restrict payment segments to those whose service agreements are linked to service points
associated with a given Address, City and/or Postal code. Note, you can specify any combination of these fields.

- All. Use this option if you do not wish to restrict payment segments based on service agreement attributes.

- Geographic Type. Use this option to restrict payment segments to those whose service agreements are linked to service
points associated with a given Geographic Type and Geographic Value.


-----

- SA Type. Use this option to restrict payment segments to those whose service agreements are linked to a given CIS
**Division and SA Type.**

Don't forget to click the search button after changing the SA Filter.

The grid that follows contains the payment segments that match your search criteria. The following information appears in
the grid:

- The Premise column contains the characteristic premise associated with the payment segment's service agreement. Refer
to Maintaining Premises for more information about this premise.

- Click the go to button to transfer to view the financial transaction related to the payment segment. This is only available
after the payment has been frozen.

- **SA Information contains summary information about the service agreement.**

- **Distributed Amt is the amount of the service agreement's debt relieved by the distribution.**

- **Adjustment ID is displayed if there is an adjustment associated with the payment. Refer to Loan Overpayments for an**
example of when an adjustment is associated with a payment.

The following information appears at the bottom of the page:

- **Payment Amount is the amount of the payment.**

- **Distributed Amount is the sum of the payment segments linked to the payment.**

- The Difference between the Payment Amount and the Distributed Amount appears if it is non-zero.

- **Billed Amount is the amount of the bill preceding the payment date.**

- **Delinquent Amount is the amount of the customer's debt that was due on / before the prior bill's due date.**

- **Current Balance is the account's current balance.**

###### Payment - Manual Distribution

You can use this page to view service agreements linked to the payment's account and to manually distribute a payment
amongst specific service agreements.

Open this page using Menu > Financial > Payment > Search and navigate to the Manual Distribution page.

**WARNING:**
Most payments are maintained using the Payment Event page. The transaction described below is typically only used to
view a payment's payment segments and to manually distribute a payment amongst an account's service agreements.

**NOTE:**
If the payment's account has more than 25 service agreements, the search criteria are intentionally left blank in order to
avoid retrieving all service agreements (with the resultant slow response times). You must therefore use the SA Filter to
define the type of service agreements that should be retrieved. See the Description of page below for more information
about this page's search criteria.

**Description of page**

**Payment Info contains a concatenation of important information about the payment.**

**Payment ID is the system-assigned unique identifier of the payment.**

**NOTE:**


-----

If the payment's account has more than 25 service agreements, the search criteria are intentionally left blank in order to
avoid retrieving all service agreements (with the resultant slow response times). You must therefore use the SA Filter to
define the type of service agreements that should be retrieved.

Use the SA Filter to define the types of service agreements that appear in the grid. The following options are available:

- Address. Use this option to restrict service agreements to those linked to service points associated with a given Address,
**City and/or Postal code. Note, you can specify any combination of these fields.**

- All. Use this option if you want to view all service agreements.

- Geographic Type. Use this option to restrict service agreements to those linked to service points associated with a given
**Geographic Type and Geographic Value.**

- SA Type. Use this option to restrict service agreements to those linked to a given CIS Division and SA Type.

Don't forget to click the search button after changing the SA Filter.

The grid that follows contains the service agreements that match your search criteria. The following information appears in
the grid:

- **Premise contains the characteristic premise associated with the service agreement.**

- **SA Information contains summary information about the service agreement.**

- **Distributed Amt is the amount of the service agreement's debt relieved by the payment. This field is gray after the**
payment is frozen.

- **Billed Amt is the amount that was billed for the service agreement on the bill preceding the payment date.**

- **Delinquent Amt is the amount of debt associated with financial transactions that appear on overdue bills.**

- **Current Balance is the amount currently owing for this service agreement.**

**NOTE:**
If the account being paid is an open item account, then an alternate grid is displayed. The alternate grid is designed to
break down payable balances by individual bill and service agreement. Both unpaid bill balances and new charges are
displayed. After distribution, a separate match event will be created for each bill paid or partially paid.

that an implementation can override the type of grid displayed for open item accounts by setting up a Financial
Transaction Options Feature Configuration with an Always Use Manual Payment Distribution By SA option set to Y.
With this in place, the system will always display the manual distribution by service agreement grid.

The open item manual distribution grid contains the following columns:

- **Bill Date**

  - Shows bill date if the row contains an account's unpaid bill.

  - Shows 'New Charges ' if the row contains an account's unbilled new charges.

  - Shows 'Payment Segment ' for the following conditions:

- Row is a pay segment of a cancelled payment.

- Row is a pay segment of an overpayment to the highest priority SA or an excess credit SA.

- Row is a pay segment of a balance forward payment distribution.

  - **Premise Information contains the characteristic premise associated with the service agreement.**

  - **SA Information contains summary information about the service agreement.**

  - **Distributed Amount**

    - You can enter an amount to distribute if the payment is non-frozen and non-cancelled, otherwise, this field is
protected.


-----

  - **Billed Amount**

    - The amount that was billed for the service agreement on the row's bill. If the row does not represent a bill amount
then this will be zero.

  - **Unpaid Amount**

    - This is determined by the "determine open-item bill amount" algorithm as defined on the installation option.

    - This column will contain zero if:

  - The row is linked to an open non-disputed match event with other bills' FTs on it. In this case, it is not possible to
determine the bill amount.

  - The row is linked to an open disputed match event.

For either grid, the following information appears at the bottom of the page:

- **Payment Amount is the amount of the payment.**

- **Distributed Amount is the sum of the payment segments linked to the payment.**

- The Difference between the Payment Amount and the Distributed Amount appears if it is non-zero.

- **Billed Amount is the amount of the bill preceding the payment date.**

- **Delinquent Amount is the amount of the customer's debt that was due on / before the prior bill's due date.**

- **Current Balance is the account's current balance.**

###### Payment - Characteristics

To update payment characteristics, open Menu > Financial > Payment > Search and navigate to the Characteristics
page.

**Description of Page**

The Characteristics collection contains information that describes miscellaneous information about the payment. The
following fields display:

**Characteristic Type Indicate the type of characteristic.**

**Sequence Controls the order in which characteristics of the same type are displayed.**

**Characteristic Value Indicate the value of the characteristic.**

###### Payment Action Codes

The topics in this section describe each of the actions that appear on the payment pages.

###### Distribute (A Payment)

Clicking the Distribute button causes a payment to be distributed amongst the account's service agreements. Refer to
Distributing A Payment Amongst An Account's Service Agreements for a description of how this is achieved.

This button is enabled if a payment is Incomplete, Error, or Freezable. Refer to Payment Lifecycle for more information
about these status values.

If the payment is distributed appropriately, click the Freeze button to freeze the payment and its payment segments.


-----

###### Redistribute (A Payment)

Clicking the Redistribute button causes a payment to be redistributed amongst the account's service agreements. Refer to
Distributing A Payment Amongst An Account's Service Agreements for a description of how this is achieved.

This button is enabled if a payment is Incomplete, Error, or Freezable. Refer to Payment Lifecycle for more information
about these status values.

If the payment is distributed appropriately, click the Freeze button to freeze the payment and its payment segments.

**NOTE:**
This button is only available on the Payment - Main and Payment - Manual Distribution pages.

###### Confirm (A Payment)

Clicking the Confirm button confirms that manually entered amounts associated to certain SAs will relieve their balances.
This is the same process that is triggered by clicking Save.

This button is enabled if a value is manually entered in a Distributed Amount field.

###### Freeze (A Payment)

Clicking the Freeze button causes a payment and its payment segments to become frozen. Refer to Payment Lifecycle for
more information about freezing.

This button is enabled if the payment is Freezable.

**NOTE:**
**If problems are detected after freezing. A payment may not be changed after it is frozen. All subsequent changes must**
occur by canceling the frozen payment and creating a new one.

###### Cancel (A Payment)

Clicking the Cancel button causes the payment and its payment segments to be canceled. Canceling a payment (as opposed
to canceling a tender) is typically only done if the original distribution was frozen and it's incorrect.

This button is enabled if the payment is Frozen. Refer to Payment Lifecycle for more information about these status values.

###### Transfer (A Payment)

The Transfer button is enabled if the payment is Frozen. Refer to Payment Lifecycle for more information about these
status values.

If the payment being transferred was created using payment event distribution rule(s), the payment transfer should also be
done using the distribution rules method. Hence, a different dialog opens when you click Transfer based on whether the
payment's payment event is associated with at least one distribution detail or not.


-----

###### Transfer Payment (No Distribution Details Exist)

Payment transfer causes the payment and its payment segments to be canceled and a new payment to be created.
Transferring a payment is typically only done if the original distribution was targeted at the wrong account but all tender
information for the pay event is correct. Unlike the payment event transfer, transferring a single payment does not affect the
pay event's tender information.

You must specify the following parameters in the Payment Transfer window to transfer a payment:

- **Account ID is the account to which the payment should be transferred.**

- **Cancel Reason defines why you are performing the transfer.**

- **Match Type and Match Value are defaulted based on their values for the payment event that you are transferring. If**
necessary, modify the values appropriately for the account to which you are transferring the payment event. Match Type
and Match Value are used for an account that belongs to an open item customer class or to restrict the distribution of the
payment to a specific service agreement. Refer to Payment Event - Main for more information.

- Turn on Freeze Payment if the transferred payment should be frozen automatically. You may want to leave this turned
off if you want to examine the payment distribution before freezing the payment.

- **Non CIS Name, Reference Number, and Non CIS Comments appear if the Account ID belongs to a customer class**
that is used for non-CIS payments. Refer to Setting Up Customer Classes for more information.

Clicking OK causes the following to take place:

- The original payment and its segments are cancelled.

- A new payment is added for the transfer to account. The payment characteristics associated with the original payment are
copied to the new payment.

- The payment is distributed amongst the new account's service agreements.

- If so designated, the new payment is frozen.

###### Transfer Payment (Distribution Details Exist)

Payment transfer causes the payment to be canceled and new payment(s) to be created using new payment event distribution
rule(s). Transferring a payment is typically done when a payment event has multiple payments and one or more payments
have been assigned to the wrong SA. Each of the incorrectly directed payments can be transferred to the correct SA(s) using
the Transfer via Distribution Rules dialog.

**Total Amount is the total payment amount to transfer from.**

You must specify the following parameters in order to transfer a payment:

- **Distribution Rule is the service agreement to which the payment should be transferred.**

- **Rule Value is the value associated with the payment and expected by the distribution rule.**

- **Amount is the payment amount.**

- **Cancel Reason defines why you are performing the transfer.**

Clicking OK causes the following to take place:

- The payment associated with the original account is canceled.

- The new set of distribution details is processed, creating new payment(s) for the transfer-to service agreement(s). The
payment characteristics associated with the original payment are copied to the new payment.

- The new set of distribution details is added to the payment event. The original distribution details are kept.


-----

**NOTE:**
**Distribution rule entries can have a zero amount. Refer to Rule Value Can Capture Additional Information for more**
information about how to use distribution details to capture additional payment related information.

**Determine Tender Account. This dialog does not call the Determine Tender Account algorithm defined on distribution**
rule as this action does not rebuild the payment tender collection.

###### Delete (A Payment)

The Delete button deletes a payment. This button is enabled if the payment is Incomplete, Error, or Freezable.

##### Payment Portal

The base package is shipped with a configured payment portal that can be used for payment processing. The portal supports
the following functionality that is not supported in the base Payment Event - Add Dialog:

- Processing of payments that require authorization (i.e. credit card payments)

- Creating non CIS payments based on payment templates

- Processing payment tenders in alternate currencies

**FASTPATH:**
Refer to The Big Picture of Portals and Zones in the Oracle Utilities Application Framework Administration Guide for
a description of portal and zone functionality.

###### Credit Card Payments

The payment portal provides the functionality needed for posting and authorizing customers' credit card charges in realtime. If the credit card authorization is successful, the payment will be added automatically (assuming you selected the
appropriate payment freeze action via the portal).

**FASTPATH:**
Refer to How To for instructions describing how to add a payment that requires authorization.

###### Non CIS Payments

The payment portal allows you to add non-CIS payments using a payment template. Payment Templates can be configured
for common types of payment allocations to pre-populate the payment distribution, allowing non-CIS payments to be
directly allocated against the appropriate distribution codes.

**FASTPATH:**
Refer to How To for instructions describing how to add a non-CIS payment using a payment template.


-----

###### Alternate Currency Payments

The payment portal allows you to process a payment tender remitted in an alternate currency. The system enables
conversion of the tendered amount into the account's currency.

**FASTPATH:**
Refer to How To for instructions describing how to process a payment in an alternate currency.

##### How To

The topics in this section describe how to perform common payment maintenance functions.

###### How To Add A New Payment Event

There are several ways to add a new event:

- You can use Payment Quick Add to quickly add one or more payment events. You'd use this approach to add simple
payments where no manual intervention is required. By "simple payment" we mean:

  - The account is both the tendering account and the account whose debt is being relieved by the payment

  - The payment date is the current date

  - The payment should be distributed amongst the account's service agreements using standard distribution logic

- If applicable to your business practice, you can use Payment Event Quick Add to quickly add one or more payment
events using distribution rules.

- You can use Payment Event Maintenance to add a payment event. You would use this approach if multiple forms of
payment are remitted (e.g., cash and a check) or if there are multiple payors and/or payees linked to the payment event.

**NOTE:**
By default the system opens the Payment Event - Add Dialog when you navigate to this page in add mode. If you have
opted to always use the payment event distribution rules method as your default method, the Payment Event Quick Add
(Single Payment Event) page appears instead. Refer to these pages for more information.

###### How To Cash A Check

If you allow customers to cash checks, you'll have a payment event with two tenders:

- The first tender contains information about the check.

- The second tender contains information about the cash refund (the tender amount is a negative amount equal to the
amount of the check).

The interesting aspect of this payment event is that it has no payments because the sum of the tenders is zero.

We start this explanation in the middle of How To Add A New Payment Event.

In the Payment Event Add dialog, be sure to select Do Not Distribute before clicking OK.


-----

- On the Main page, click - to remove the payment (cashing a check is a payment event with no payments).

- Transfer to the Payment Event, Tenders page.

- **Insert a row in the tender scroll (click the + button) for the cash refund tender. In this row enter a tender type of "cash"**
and a tender amount of negative the check amount.

- Save the event (note there is nothing to distribute or freeze).

###### How To Allocate The Tender Amount To Multiple Accounts

When you add a payment event, the system automatically creates a single payment for the account that remitted the funds. If
someone is remitting funds for someone other than themselves, you must change/add payments. This section describes how
to do this.

**NOTE:**
This section assumes you chose to add the payment event using the Payment Event - Add Dialog. Refer to How To Add
A New Payment Event for the complete list of options.

In the Payment Event - Add Dialog, be sure to select Do Not Distribute before clicking OK.

On the payment event Main page, do the following:

- If the remitting account shouldn't have received any part of the payment, Remove it from the payments grid by clicking
the - button. Alternatively, you can just change the account id to reflect the recipient.

- If multiple accounts receive the remitted funds, Insert one row in the payments grid (click the + button) for each
additional account.

- When the payment event is balanced, Save it. Then Distribute and Freeze the payment(s). Refer to Payment Event
Actions for more information on these action buttons.

###### How To Print Receipts And Endorsements

The system can be configured to allow you to endorse checks and print receipts using special cashiering station printers.
This section describes the print options available.

**NOTE:**
These options are only available if they have been installed in your system. Installing these options are a delivery and
installation issue and are not within the domain of this document. Refer to the Receipt Printing section of the Optional
Products Installation Guide for information on how to enable these print options.

The print functions are available from the Payment Event, Payment Quick Add and Payment Event Quick Add transactions.
Refer to those sections for more information.

The print dialog functions are described below.

**Description of Page**

Use the Endorse button to endorse checks using the cashier station printer. This is only enabled if at least one tender type is
not like cash and does not generate an automatic payment. If there are multiple checks, use the scroll buttons to select them.
Feed the appropriate check in the printer and an endorsement message is printed on the back.

Use the Receipt button to print a receipt using the cashier station printer. Choose a Short or Long option. Use the
**Duplicate button to print a duplicate receipt. This prints the receipt with a "Duplicate" label.**


-----

Use the Stub button to print special information in bill stub format (e.g. account, name, amount). Feed a slip of paper into
the printer and the special stub information will be printed.

**NOTE:**
The various text strings that are printed on the receipt and the endorsement are defined on the Payment Receipt Message
and Endorse Message messages on the Point Of Sale (POS) Printer Integration master configuration. Refer to the master
configuration’s embedded help for more details.

The Stub function is available only on the Payment Event page.

Refer to the Optional Products Installation Guide for details on the print BPA script samples provided in base and for
sample printouts using these scripts.

###### How To Cancel A Tender

If a tender is no longer valid (e.g., a check bounces), the tender must be canceled. The following steps explain how to do
this.

**WARNING:**
These steps only make sense in the context of the page used to maintain tenders. Refer to Payment Event - Tenders for
the details.

You navigate through the pages as follows:

1. Open the payment event - tenders page for the tender in question. Proceed to step 2.

2. Click Cancel. Proceed to step 3.

3. Before the system cancels the tender, you must specify the cancel reason. The tender cancel window opens.

In the tender cancel window, select a Cancel Reason to describe why the tender is being canceled. The system also needs to
know which Bank Account To Charge the cancellation against. The system will default the Bank and Bank Account Key
from the original bank information used when the tender was deposited. You can override them here.

When you click the OK button, the system cancels the tender and ALL payments linked to the event.

If the cancellation reason you supply is indicated as being "non-sufficient funds", the system will generate an adjustment to
levy a NSF charge. Refer to SA Type - Main Information for more information.

**NOTE:**
**When non-canceled tenders are still linked to the event. If there are multiple tenders linked to the payment event, you**
must either add new payment(s) that equal the sum of the event's non-canceled tenders or cancel the remaining tenders.

**Cancellation after cash back. If a customer tenders a check for $100, but only owes $80, the system will recommend**
returning $20 in cash to the customer (assuming the tender type for checks allows overpayment). If the tender type for
checks is not "like cash", a second tender is created for -$20 (the first tender is for $100). If the check subsequently
bounces, both tenders must be cancelled.

###### How To Transfer A Payment From One Account To Another

If you need to transfer a payment amount from one account to another, you can use the Transfer button either on the
payment event page or the payment page.

**FASTPATH:**


-----

Refer to Transferring A Payment for a description of when to use each option.

###### How To Distribute A Payment To A Specific Service Agreement

When you click Distribute, the system uses the payment distribution algorithm defined on the account's customer class to
allocate the payment amongst the account's service agreements. In this section, we describe how to override this distribution
(e.g., when you need to allocate a payment to specific service agreement(s)).

We start this explanation in the middle of How To Add A New Payment Event.

In the Payment Event Add dialog, be sure to select Do Not Distribute before clicking OK.

- **Save the payment event (this also saves the payment and tender information).**

- Use the Payment Amount context menu to transfer to the Manual Distribution page.

- Fill in the desired Distributed Amt for each service agreement and save the payment.

- Click Freeze to freeze the payment when the amount distributed is equal to the payment amount.

###### How To Get An Unbalanced Tender Control In Balance (Fixing Over/ Under)

In order to balance a tender control that is out-of-balance, you must create a tender for an account associated with your
company.

**NOTE:**
**The over / under account. Your organization must set up a company-use account with a service agreement whose**
SA type references the over/under distribution code. This account should be linked to the person ID associated with
company usage.

- If you have more money in the drawer than you have tenders, then you're "over". In this situation, you need to record a
payment for the "over" amount and the tender type configured for cash drawer over/under amounts. This will cause cash
to be debited by the over amount, and the expense account associated with the account's service agreement to be credited.

- If you have less money in the drawer than you have tenders, then you're "under". In this situation, you need to record a
negative payment for the "under" amount and the tender type configured for cash drawer over/under amounts. This will
cause cash to be credited by the over amount, and the expense account associated with the account's service agreement to
be debited.

**IMPORTANT:**
A separate tender type is used for recording cash drawer over/under amounts. Once the over/under amount has been
determined, you must enter a new tender using your over/under tender type for the company-use account. Check out the
following table for an example:


Tender Type Starting Balance Tenders

Received


Turn Ins Actual Ending

Balance (Entered

by Cashier)


Expected Ending

Balance


Over/Under

Amount


Cash $150.50 $5,000 $4,000 $1151 $1150.50 Over $0.50

Check - $1,000 $750 $249 $250 Under $1


-----

Over/Under - $-0.50 - - $-0.50 Over $0.50

In this example, you'd have to create a new tender for the company-use account for the amount that will be distributed to the
company-use account's service agreement (debit over/under expense, credit cash):

- Tender type: Over/Under, Tender amount: -$0.50

**NOTE:**
**You must reopen the tender control. Before you can add an over/under tender to a tender control, you must re open**
the tender control (tenders may only be added to open tender controls).

###### How To Add A Non-CIS Payment Using A Template

The payment portal allows you to add non-CIS payments using a payment template. Payment Templates can be configured
for common types of payment allocations to pre-populate the payment distribution and allowing non-CIS payments to be
directly allocated against distribution codes. The following steps explain how to do this.

You navigate through the pages as follows:

- Open Menu > Financial > Payment Portal.

- The Add Non CIS Payment Zone shows a list of all active payment templates. Use the Add button to add a non-CIS
payment for a specific payment template.

- Enter the payment and tender details ( Payment Amount, Payment Date defaults to the current date, Tender Source is
used to find an open tender control when adding the tender).

**NOTE:**
**Authorizing Tenders. If the Tender Type selected requires authorization (i.e. credit card payments), additional**
authorization details are required (e.g. credit card type, credit card number, etc.). Only one tender that requires
authorization can exist for a single payment event.

**FASTPATH:**
**For information about tender types requiring authorization, refer to How To Authorize A Credit Card Tender.**

- Enter the non-CIS information for the customer remitting the payment ( Customer Name, Agreement Number and
**Comments to describe anything unusual about the non CIS payment).**

**NOTE:**
**Payor Account ID. The Non CIS Account Id specified on the payment template is used as the tendering account. If the**
account has exceeded your cash-only threshold and the Tender Type isn't marked as "like cash", a warning appears
advising of such.

**Including a CIS payment. If a portion of the tender is for a CIS payment, ensure that the Add CIS Payment checkbox**
is selected. The system will process the non-CIS payment, and then navigate the user to the Payment Event page where
the CIS payment can be included.

- The distribution details are defaulted from the payment template but may be overridden. You can add additional
distribution lines. Enter the payment amount and Reference Number for each applicable distribution line.

- When you click the OK button, the system creates the payment event and tender(s). A single payment is created for each
non-zero amount entry in the distribution details list. The payment template is captured as a characteristic on the tender.
The corresponding distribution code, GL account and reference number are captured as characteristics on each payment.


-----

When the financial transactions are created for these payments, the distribution code (and GL account) is retrieved from
the payment characteristic collection.

###### How To Authorize A Credit Card Tender

You can use the Payment Portal to add a payment event for a tender that requires authorization. The following steps explain
how to do this.

If your organization is using the base tender authorization functionality, you can navigate through the pages as follows:

- Open Menu > Financial > Payment Portal.

- The Add CIS Payment zone only expands if there's an account in context. To expand this zone, either search for an
account using Control Central or use the Tender Search available on the Payment Portal.

- Use the Add Payment button to add a payment for the account displayed in the zone.

- The information displayed is the same as that on the Payment Event - Add Dialog, except for the following:

  - Use Distribute Action to describe what you'd like to have happen when you click the OK button. The dropdown
contains the following values - Distribute and Freeze if OK, Manual Distribution and Manual Distribution - Multiple
Payments

**NOTE:**
The Distribute and Freeze if OK and Manual Distribution options are also present on the Distribute Action on the
payment event add dialog screen. The third option, Manual Distribution - Multiple Payments, is special for credit
card authorization processing. This option is similar to the Manual Distribution option except that the user is navigated
to the Payment Event maintenance page after authorization has taken place.

- If the Tender Type selected requires authorization (e.g., credit card payments), additional authorization details are
required (e.g. credit card type, credit card number, etc.). This information is displayed in the Credit Card Information
section.

**NOTE:**
**Authorizing Tenders. Only one tender that requires authorization can exist for a single payment event.**

- The Authorization Override checkbox is only displayed if the tender type selected requires authorization. Use the
**Authorization Override checkbox to indicate whether or not tender authorization should take place. If Authorization**
**Override is checked, an authorization code must be entered and the system bypasses the authorization web service call.**

- Click OKto save the payment and navigate to the appropriate page.

- Assuming the credit card is accepted, the authorization code returned by the credit card authorization provider is captured
as a tender characteristic.

- If the credit card is declined, the tender will not be added.

###### How To Reverse A Credit Card Tender

The steps required to reverse a credit card tender are the same as the steps for How To Cancel A Tender.

The reversal code from the credit card authorization service is stored as a tender characteristic.

**FASTPATH:**


-----

For more information on authorizing credit card payments, refer to the following business objects: Tender Type - Credit
Card with Authorization, CyberSource - Credit Card Authorization and CyberSource - Credit Card Reversal.

###### How To Process An Alternate Currency Payment

You can use the Payment Portal to add a payment event for a tender(s) in an alternate currency, i.e. a currency that differs
from the account's currency. The following steps explain how to do this.

- Open Menu > Financial > Payment Portal.

- The Add CIS Payment Zone only expands if there's an account in context. To expand this zone, either search for an
account using Control Central or use the Tender Search available on the Payment Portal.

- Use the Add Payment button to add a payment for the account displayed in the zone.

- The information displayed is the same as that on the Payment Event - Add Dialog, except for the following:

  - If your organization accepts payment tenders in alternate currencies, the Currency Converter button appears in the
tender list

- Use the Currency Converterbutton to enter the Tendered Amount and Tendered Currency in the alternate currency
and click OK. The system will convert the alternate currency amount to the account's currency.

- Click OKto save the payment and navigate to the appropriate page.

- When you click the OK button, the system creates the payment event and tender(s). Each tender is linked to an
appropriate tender control based on the currency of the tender.

**FASTPATH:**
Refer to Alternate Currency Payments for more information.

##### Financial Transactions On A Payment

##### Payment History

The payment history page shows all payments that have been distributed to an account's service agreements. Open this page
using Menu > Financial Query > Account Payment History.

**Description of Page**

One row is displayed for every payment that has been distributed to an account's service agreements. The payment date,
amount, payment status and the tender source associated with the tender's tender control are displayed for each payment.

**NOTE:**
**Tender Source typically contains the description of the cash drawer in which the payment was made or the remittance**
processor that processed the payment. Tender source will be blank for automatic payments until they are interfaced to


-----

the financial institution. Refer to Downloading Automatic Payments for more information about interfacing automatic
payments.

If you need to see more detailed information about the payment, click the Go To button to transfer to the payment event
page.

###### Payment Tender History

The Payment Tender History page shows a list of all tenders linked to an open tender control for the current user. Open
this page using Menu > Financial Query > Payment Tender History.

**Description of Page**

One row is displayed for every tender that is linked to an open tender control to which the current user has access. The
freeze date/time, payment date, pay tender ID, payor account, tender amount, tender type and tender status are displayed for
each tender.

##### Payment / Tender Search

This page allows you to look for payments and/or tenders using a combination of search criteria. Open this page using
**Menu > Financial Query > Payment / Tender Search.**

**Description of Page**

The top half of the page is where you enter the criteria used to search for payments and tenders.

**NOTE:**
**Multiple search criteria may be specified. You can search for payments and tenders using a combination of search**
criteria. For example, if you enter both a Payment Account name of Brandon and a Payment Amount between 150 and
170; only those payments for customers named Brandon whose amount is between 150 and 170 will be displayed.

**WARNING:**
Try to be as specific as possible when entering search criteria. Why? Because entering open-ended search criteria may
have a severe impact on response times. For example, if you know the payments you're looking for have a payment date
sometime in January 2003 and the customer's name is Brazil,John, then enter both of these criteria. If you also know the
payment amount is between 150 and 170, enter these values too.

The following table describes each of the different search methods.

##### Maintaining Deposit Controls

Deposit controls exist to give you administrative control over your cash drawers (and all other tender sources) and the
subsequent deposit of funds at banks.

**FASTPATH:**
Refer to Tender Management and Workstation Cashiering for background information.

**NOTE:**
**The system creates most deposit controls behind-the-scenes. Most deposit controls are created by the system when**
it processes tenders from your remittance processor and lock boxes. You should only have to access the deposit control
pages if you record payments in cash drawers. For information about how the system creates deposit controls, refer to
Managing Payments Interfaced From External Sources. Also note that the automatic payment activation process also
creates tender and deposit controls. Refer to Activating Automatic Payments for more information.

###### The Lifecycle Of A Deposit Control

The following diagram shows the possible lifecycle of a deposit control.


-----

Open A deposit control is initially created in the Open state. While in this state, you may add new deposits to it, change the
deposit amount on its deposits, and transfer tender controls into and out of it.

Balancing In Progress You change a deposit control's status to Balancing In Progress when you're ready to balance its
contents. While in this state, you can change the deposit amount on its deposits and transfer tender controls out of it. If you
need to add new deposits to it or transfer tender controls into it you must return it to the Open state.

Balanced You change a deposit control's status to Balanced when the sum of its tender controls is consistent with the total
of its deposits. While in this state, you cannot modify its deposits or its tender controls. If you need to make modifications,
you must return it to the Open or Balancing In Progress state.

**NOTE:**
**Background processes and state transition. When payments are interfaced from external sources, the system**
automatically creates a deposit control and links a tender control to it. When all payments have been successfully
loaded, the system changes the state of the respective deposit control to Balanced.

###### Deposit Control - Main

The Main page contains core deposit control information. Open this page using Menu > Financial > Deposit Control >
**Search.**

**Description of Page**

**Deposit Control contains a concatenation of the deposit control's creation date, tender source type, and status.**

**Deposit Control ID is the system-assigned, unique identifier of the deposit control.**

**Create Date/Time is the date and time the deposit control was created.**

**Tender Source Type is the type of tender control that has been linked to the deposit control. Valid values are: Ad hoc,**
Auto Pay, Online Cashiering and Lockbox. The system uses this information to prevent tender controls from different
sources from being included under the same deposit control. In other words, you can't mix automatic payment, cashiering
and lockbox tenders under the same deposit control.

**Currency Code is the currency in which the deposit control's tenders are denominated.**

**NOTE:**


-----

**Default note. The currency code defaults from the installation record.**

The summary information that follows contains a summary of the starting balance and the tenders that are linked to the
tender control.

###### The Lifecycle Of A Tender Control

The following diagram shows the possible lifecycle of a tender control.

Open A tender control is initially created in the Open state. While in this state, you may add new tenders to it, change the
tender amount on its tenders, and transfer tenders into and out of it.

Balancing In Progress You change a tender control's status to Balancing In Progress when you're ready to balance its
contents. While in this state, you can change the tender amount on its tenders and transfer tenders out of it. If you need to
add new tenders to it or transfer tenders into it, you must return it to the Open state.

Balanced You change a tender control's status to Balanced when the sum of its tenders is consistent with the ending balance
in the drawer. While in this state, you cannot modify it or its tenders. If you need to make modifications, you must return it
to the Open or Balancing In Progress state.

If the tender control is part of a Balanced deposit control, you may not change its status.

**NOTE:**


-----

**Background processes and state transition. When payments are interfaced from external sources, the system**
automatically creates a tender control and links tenders to it (one for each payment interfaced). When all payments have
been successfully loaded, the system changes the state of the respective tender control to Balanced.

###### Tender Control - Main

The Main page contains core tender control information. This page is used to balance the tender control.

Open this page using Menu > Financial > Tender Control > Search.

**NOTE:**
**Searching For Tender Controls. When you use the Creation Date to search for tender controls, the system returns**
tender controls that are created on or before the date you specify. If the number of records returned exceeds the search
limit (i.e. 300 records), only the records that do not exceed search limit are displayed. Therefore, you may need to
specify an earlier creation date to find the record you are looking for. If you do not specify a creation date and search
based on other criteria, the system uses the most recent date.

**FASTPATH:**

Payment Staging

You need only populate rows on this table if any of the following conditions apply:

- If you need to distribute a payment tender to an account other than that defined with the CUST_ID on the payment tender
staging record, you must create a payment staging record. You may distribute a tender to multiple accounts by creating
multiple payment staging records. Note, if you want to distribute the payment tender to the same account, you do NOT
need a payment staging record.

- If you want to restrict a payment to a specific service agreement, you must insert a row on this table to indicate the
specific the service agreement in question. You do this by populating MATCH_TYPE_CD with a value that indicates
that you are paying for a specific service agreement and MATCH_VALUE with the unique ID of the service agreement.

- If you practice open-item accounting, you must insert a row on this table for each to indicate the open-item to which the
payment should be matched. Note, because open-item customer typically match payments to bills, you would populate
MATCH_TYPE_CD with a value to indicate that you are matching by bill ID and MATCH_VALUE with the unique ID
of the bill.

###### Process PUPL - Upload Payments


-----

The background process (PUPL) loads the contents of the various payment staging records into the various payment event
tables. The tables that are populated by this process are shown in the left orange section of the following ERD (the right
orange section are the staging tables populated by the process described above)

The topics in this section describe how these tables are populated.

Phase 1 - Create Deposit Control

Phase 2 - Create Tender Control

Phase 3 - Create Payment Events, Tenders, Payments, and Payment Segments

**Phase 1 - Create Deposit Control**

The following points describe, at a high level, the first phase of the payment upload process:

- PUPL checks that the record counts and money totals of tender control stagings add up to the expected amount on
deposit control staging. If not,

  - PUPL sets the status of the deposit control staging to be Error . None of the tender controls within the deposit control
will be processed until everything adds up. You can fix these on the Deposit Control Staging page.

  - When PUPL runs next, it will recheck the totals on deposit control stagings that are in Error or Pending

- If the record and dollar amounts are clean,

  - PUPL creates the corresponding deposit control

  - PUPL sets the status of the deposit control staging to be In Progress

Top of Page

**Phase 2 - Create Tender Control**


-----

The following points describe, at a high level, the second phase of the payment upload process:

- PUPL checks that record counts and money totals of payment tender staging(s) adds up to expected amount on tender
control staging. If not,

  - PUPL sets the status of the tender control staging to be Error . None of the tender controls within the deposit control
will be processed until everything adds up for ALL tender controls. You can fix these on the Tender Control Staging
page.

**NOTE:**
that the Deposit Control Staging record is not updated - its status is unchanged. Neither is the Pay Tender Staging record
updated - its status also remains unchanged. Only the Tender Control Staging record is updated to be in Error .

- When PUPL runs next, it will recheck the totals of tender control stagings that are in Error or Pending.

- If the record and dollar amounts are clean,

  - PUPL creates the corresponding tender control.

  - PUPL sets the status of the tender control staging to be In Progress .

Top of Page

**Phase 3 - Create Payment Events, Tenders, Payments, and Payment Segments**

At this point, all deposit control stagings and tender control stagings are in the state of In Progress. Next, PUPL starts the
upload of payment tender staging and payment staging. The following points describe, at a high level, this phase of the
payment upload process:

- If the payment tender staging record has a future accounting date, the processing for the record is skipped. This prevents
uploaded payments from being created and subsequently frozen until their accounting date is reached. (Some external
sources may provide advance notification of payments to be made in the future.) A skipped staging record remains in the
Pending state until its accounting date is reached.

- PUPL checks money totals of payment advices (if any) adds up to expected amount on payment tender staging.

  - If not, PUPL sets the payment tender staging's status to Error .

  - Any errors are written to the Payment Upload Exception table. You can fix these errors on the Payment Upload
Staging page and change the record's status back to Pending.

  - When PUPL runs next, it will recheck the totals of the payment tender staging

- If payment tender staging record is clean:

  - PUPL creates a corresponding payment event, tender, and payment.

  - If the account on payment tender staging is wrong, the account on the corresponding tender will be the tender source's
suspense SA's account. Refer to Setting Up Tender Sources for more information. Refer to How To Transfer A
Payment From One Account To Another for how to transfer to payment to the correct account.

  - If the account on payment advice is wrong, the account on the corresponding payment will be the account on the
payment tender.

  - PUPL distributes the payment(s) amongst the account's service agreements, and payment segments are created. Note,
the payment could be in error if there are no SAs for the account (as well as other reasons). Payments in error are
written to the payment exception (CI_PAY_EXCP).

  - PUPL changes the payment tender staging's status to Complete.

- If all payment tender stagings are Complete:

  - PUPL changes the tender control staging's status to Complete.

  - PUPL changes the deposit control staging's status to Complete .


-----

- If there are payment tender staging that are not Complete

  - The status of the tender control staging will still be In progress .

  - The status of the deposit control staging will still be In progress .

- PUPL will attempt to upload the offending payment tender staging records when it next runs.

**NOTE:** **Balancing Control Tables. The balancing of the deposit and tender control tables during payment upload can**
either be done by PUPL, or after PUPL successfully completes. The latter might be useful for high volume payment
uploads that could result in deadlocks on these control tables. If your implementation wishes to execute control table
balancing after PUPL completes, ensure that the necessary batch parameter is set to exclude balancing when PUPL runs
and also that the separate balancing batch process (C1-PUBAL) is scheduled after PUPL.

###### PYUP-PRG - Purge Payment Upload Objects

Completed payment upload staging objects should be periodically purged from the system by executing the PYUP-PRG
background process. This background process allows you to purge all Completed payment upload staging objects older than
a given number of days.

We want to stress that there is no system constraint as to the number of Completed payment upload objects that may exist.
You can retain these objects for as long as you desire. However we recommend that you periodically purge Completed
payment upload objects as they exist only to satisfy auditing and reporting needs.

###### Maintaining Deposit Control Staging

The Deposit Control Staging page has three purposes:

- You can view historical deposit and tender control staging records associated with uploaded payments.

- You can correct deposit and tender control records that are in error.

- You can add deposit and tender control records to be uploaded by the payment upload background process.

The topics in this section describe this page.

###### Data Setup Examples of Payment Distribution Details

Typically, each staging record will represent a single payment event - with a corresponding payment tender and
payment. However, it is possible to specify complex relationships within a set of staging records. For example, it will be
straightforward to define a set of staging records that represent a single tender but multiple payments (to model the single
payment tender of a welfare agency which covers payments for multiple accounts). Similarly, it is equally possible to define
a set of staging records that represent a single payment but multiple tenders (although not a common requirement).

Each staging record can represent:

- Zero or one new payment events. Typically, each detail staging record will represent a single payment event. However, it
is possible to define multiple records for a single payment event. All details for a single payment event are identified by a
common value on the staging record: Pay Event Process ID.

**NOTE:**


-----

**Pay Event Process ID. This field is used for grouping staging records and for organizing parallel threads (in the C1-**
PEPL2 process). Therefore, it is strongly encouraged that it bears a relationship to the tender account ID.

- A partial or one new payment tenders. Typically, each detail staging record will represent a single payment tender.
However, it is possible to define multiple staging records for a single pay tender. All details for a single tender are
identified by a common payment event ID as well as common tender information (tender type, tender account ID, check
number, external reference, etc.).

- A partial or many new payments. Typically, each detail staging record will represent a set of one or many new payments.
However, it is possible to define multiple staging records for a single payment. All details for a single payment are
identified by a common payment event ID as well as common distribution rule and characteristic value information.

The sections below provide examples of a few of these complex payment event configurations. Note that these examples
assume the same distribution rule is referenced in all staging records.

###### The Lifecycle of a Payment Event Upload Staging Record

The following diagram shows the possible lifecycle of a payment event upload staging record.


-----

- Incomplete. A payment event staging record is initially created in incomplete state. The C1-PEPL1 process sets it to
pending once it links it to a tender control and determines its tender account.

- Pending. The C1-PEPL2 process sets a pending record to complete once all processing logic is executed and a payment
event is linked to it.

- Complete. When processing of the staging record is complete the record is in the complete state. This is a final state.

- Error. A payment event staging record may be set to Error from Incomplete or Pending states by the C1-PEPL1 and C1PEPL2 processes respectively.

**FASTPATH:**
Refer to To Do Entries Instead of Exceptions for more information on how To Do entries are used to capture processing
errors.

###### To Do Entries Instead of Exception Records

Instead of creating an exception record for staging records in the Error state the C1-PEPL1 and C1-PEPL2 background
processes create To Do entries and link them to the offending staging records.

Each process determines the To Do type to use for reporting errors by looking for the To Do Type defined with this process
as its creation process.

###### Process C1-PEPL1 - Upload Payments (Step 1)

The batch process C1-PEPL1 refers to the first of three background processes that load the contents of the payment event
upload staging records into the various payment tables.

The responsibility of this process is to transition the status of the staging records from Incomplete to Pending. The status of
a staging record must remain Incomplete until:

- It is linked to a tender control. This process creates a new deposit control record. It creates a new tender control record
if the staging record is not currently linked to one. It then updates the payment event upload staging records with the
corresponding Tender Control ID.


-----

- The Tender Account ID field is populated. The Determine Tender Account algorithm defined on the distribution rule is
called and the returned account ID is posted on the staging record.

- The Pay Event Process ID field is populated. If left blank this field is set equal to the Tender Account ID.

The following diagram and the sections below describe at a high level the processing phases of the C1-PEPL1 background
process.

- Phase 1 - Create Tender Control

- Phase 2 - Determine Tender Account

**Phase 1 - Create Tender Control**

**NOTE:**
This step cannot be bounded by thread range but must execute across the entire population of staging details. Therefore
this step in the process is designed so that all parallel threads attempt to execute it at the same time but only one thread
succeeds to avoid creating duplicate tender controls.

This step creates all tender controls required by the upload records as follows:

- For each distinct tender source transmissions represented within the incomplete set of upload staging details a deposit
control and a tender control are created in an open state. (If the upload record is already linked to a tender control, then
that tender control is used and a new one is not created.)

- If an error occurs at this stage

  - A designated staging record for the transmission group (one is picked at random) is set to Error and a To Do entry is
created and linked to it to capture the error message that applies for the whole transmission group. Other records in
the group remain incomplete .

  - The process stops.

**NOTE:**
**Group Error. This technique allows for an easier recovery from a setup error that may affect a large volume of records**
in a single transmission. Capturing the error only on a single designated record requires only this record to be set back to
Incomplete once the setup issue is corrected. It is important to note that the transmission group is not processes if at least
one of the records in the group is in Error status.

- Once a transmission group of records is fully processed, a To Do cleanup processing takes place to complete To Do
entries previously raised for its designated staging record.

**FASTPATH:**
Refer to To Do Entries Instead of Exceptions for more information on how To Do entries are used to capture processing
errors.


-----

Top of Page

**Phase 2 - Determine Tender Account**

After all tender controls have been created the second step attempts to transition all incomplete records to the pending state.

Each incomplete staging record is processed as follows:

- If not yet associated with a tender control ID, the process looks for an Open tender control that matches the batch code,
batch number and external source ID and links it to the staging record. An error is raised if a matching tender control is
not found.

- Execute the Determine Tender Account algorithm defined on the distribution rule and populate the record with the
returned account ID. Note that the algorithm is called even when the tender account is populated to provide for a
potential override of the initial value when necessary. An error is raised if a tender account may not be determined.

- If not already populated, the Pay Event Process ID is set equal to the Tender Account ID. The C1-PEPL2 process uses
this field to organize the parallel threads and to group multiple staging details into a single payment event.

- The staging record is moved to pending state.

- If any errors occur set the record to Error and create a To Do entry for the error message.

- If no error occurred, a To Do cleanup processing takes place to complete To Do entries previously raised for the staging
record.

**FASTPATH:**
Refer to To Do Entries Instead of Exceptions for more information on how To Do entries are used to capture processing
errors.

**NOTE:**
This step is designed to support execution in parallel threads based upon the sequence number portion of the staging
table prime key.

###### Process C1-PEPL2 - Upload Payments (Step 2)

The batch process C1-PEPL2 refers to the second of three background processes that load the contents of the payment event
upload staging records into the various payment tables.

The responsibility of the C1-PEPL2 process is to create payment events, payment tenders and payments and transition the
corresponding staging records from Pending to Complete.

The following diagram and the section below describe at a high level the processing phases of the C1-PEPL2 background
process.


-----

Each distinct group of pending staging records associated with the same external source ID, external transmit ID,
accounting date, and pay event process ID is processed as follows:

- A payment event is created for the group and stamped on each of its records.

- A payment tender is created for each distinct set of staging records having the same tender account, tender type and other
tender information fields, except for the tender amount.

- The Create Payment algorithm is then called for each distinct group of staging records having the same tender account,
distribution rule and rule value providing it with the total amount for the group.

- The staging record is moved to the complete state.

- If any error occurs a designated staging record for the payment event group (one is picked at random) is set to Error and
a To Do entry is created and linked to it to capture the error message that applies for the whole group. Other records in
the group remain incomplete .

**NOTE:**
**Group Error. This technique allows for an easier recovery from an error that affects all staging records for a single**
payment event. Capturing the error only on a single designated record requires only this record to be set back to pending
once the issue is corrected. It is important to note that the whole set of records is not processes if at least one of the
records in the group is in Error status.

- If no error occurred, a To Do cleanup processing takes place to complete To Do entries previously raised for the
designated staging record.

**FASTPATH:**
Refer to To Do Entries Instead of Exceptions for more information on how To Do entries are used to capture processing
errors.

**NOTE:**
This process is designed to support execution in parallel threads based upon the payment event process ID field.


-----

###### Process C1-PEPL3 - Upload Payments (Step 3)

The batch process C1-PEPL3 refers to the last of three background processes that load the contents of the payment event
upload staging records into the various payment tables.

The responsibility of the C1-PEPL3 process is to update the status of the related deposit and tender controls from open to
balanced.

Each distinct tender control for which all associated staging records are in complete status is processed as follows:

- The tender deposit is created.

- The tender control is set to balanced.

- The deposit control is set to balanced.

**NOTE:**
This process is designed to support execution in parallel threads based upon the Tender Control ID field.

The Payment Event Upload Staging page has three purposes:

- You can view historical payment event upload staging records associated with uploaded payments.

- You can correct payment event upload staging records that are in error.

- You can add new payment event upload staging records to be uploaded by the payment event upload processes.

The topics in this section describe this page.

###### Payment Event Upload Staging - Main

This page shows the details of a payment event upload staging record.

**FASTPATH:**
Refer to Populating The Payment Event Upload Staging Records for more information about this record.

Open this page using Menu > Financial > Payment Event Upload Staging > Search.

**Description of Page**

**External Source ID corresponds with an external source ID on one of the your tender sources. This should be the unique**
ID of the source of the interfaced payments. Refer to Setting Up Tender Sources for more information.

**External Transmission ID is the unique identifier of the transmission of payments from the external source. This must be a**
unique value for each transmission from the source.

**Sequence is the identifier of the record within the transmission. The C1-PEPL1 process uses this field to organize the**
parallel threads.

**Accounting Date is the payment date that should be used for accounting purposes.**

**Distribution Rule is the rule by which the payment detail is to be processed. A default distribution rule is displayed if you**
have set one.


-----

**Rule Value is a value associated with the payment and expected by the distribution rule.**

**Match Type and Match Value are only used if the distribution of the payment should be restricted in some way (i.e., the**
standard payment distribution algorithm should not be used). Match Type indicates how the payment should be distributed
(e.g., only distribute to a specific service agreement), Match Value indicates the ID of the restriction (e.g., the service
agreement ID).

**Payor Account ID is the tender account. If not populated the C1-PEPL1 process populates this field by calling the**
Determine Tender Account algorithm defined on the distribution rule.

**Tender Amount is the amount tendered (i.e., the payment amount).**

**Currency Code is the currency of the tendered amount. This should be the same as currency defined on the tender**
**source.**

**Tender Type defines the form or remittance (e.g., cash, check, etc.). Note that the Tender Type defaults from the**
installation record.

**NOTE:**
**Authorizing Tenders. The Tender Type dropdown list does not include tender types that require authorization (i.e.**
credit card payments).

**FASTPATH:**
**For information about tender types requiring authorization, refer to Credit Card Payments.**

**Check Number is the check number on the payment.**

**MICR ID is the value of the magnetic ink character recognition (MICR) line on the payment.**

**External Reference ID may be used to record external information associated with the payment tender.**

**Customer ID may be used to record additional customer information.**

**Name may be used to record additional payment tender information.**

**Tender Control ID is the tender control associated with the payment. This field is should typically be left for the C1-**
PEPL1 process to populate.

If the Tender Type is associated with an automatic payment, the Auto Pay section displays. The system attempts to default
automatic payment information from the account's auto-pay option if the tender type is the same as the tender type on the
account's auto-pay source and if the auto pay option is effective on the payment date. If the system is unable to default
information, you must specify the source of the funds and the customer's account number / credit card number at the
financial institution.

- **Auto Pay Source is the financial institution / credit card company that receives the automatic payment request.**

- **External Account ID is the customer's account number at the financial institution.**

- **Expires On is only needed if the Tender Type indicates that an expiration date is necessary (e.g., for a credit card**
payment).

- **Name is the customer's name in the financial institution's system.**

**Pay Event Process ID is used to group multiple staging records into a single payment event. If not populated, the C1-**
PEPL1 process sets this field equal to the Payor Account ID.

**Pay Event Staging Status shows the state of the staging record. Refer to The Lifecycle of a Payment Event Upload Staging**
for a state transition overview.

**Payment Event ID is the system-assigned, unique identifier of the related payment event. The C1-PEPL2 process populates**
this field when it creates a payment event for the upload staging record. You can use this field to navigate to the payment
event page.

If a staging record is in Error state then the error message associated with the corresponding To Do entry is displayed.

#### Adjustments

In this section, we describe when and how to adjust a service agreement's balance.

##### The Big Picture Of Adjustments

The topics in this section provide background information about a variety of adjustment issues.

**FASTPATH:**
We strongly recommend familiarizing yourself with the topics described in The Financial Big Picture to fully appreciate
the place of an adjustment in the system's financial architecture. In particular, refer to Setting Up Adjustment Types and
Setting Up Adjustment Type Profiles.

###### Adjustments - Current Balance versus Payoff Balance

Adjusting how much a customer owes involves changing a service agreement's payoff balance and/or current balance by
creating an adjustment. In this section we describe these two balances.

**WARNING:**
If you do not understand the difference between payoff balance and current balance, refer to Current Amount versus
Payoff Amount.

###### When Current Balance Equals Payoff Balance

For most service agreements, payoff balance and current balance are always the same (or in colloquial speech - the amount
the customer thinks they owe equals what they really owe). In this situation, an adjustment is easy: both payoff balance and
current balance are adjusted by the same value.

Let's run through a typical example. The values in the payoff balance and current balance columns reflect the amount due
after the financial transaction has been applied (i.e., the running balance):

Date Financial Transaction Payoff Balance Current Balance

1-Jan-99 Bill: $125 125 125

15-Jan-99 Payment: $150 -25 -25

2-Feb-99 Bill: $175 150 150

14-Feb-99 Payment: $150 0 0

3-Mar-99 Bill: $200 200 200

15-Mar-99 Payment: $150 50 50

2-Apr-99 Bill: $225 275 275

27-Apr-99 Adj: Late Payment Charge $10 285 285


-----

As you can see, payoff balance and current balance are always in sync.

###### When Current Balance Differs From Payoff Balance

For some service agreements, payoff balance and current balance differ (or in colloquial speech - the amount the customer
thinks they owe differs from what they would owe if they wanted to payoff their account).

Let's run through an example of a customer on a budget to illustrate a classic service agreement where these two balances
are not the same. The values in the payoff balance and current balance columns reflect the amount due after the financial
transaction has been applied:

Date Financial Transaction Payoff Balance Current Balance

1-Jan-99 Bill: $125, Budget $150 125 150

15-Jan-99 Payment: $150 -25 0

2-Feb-99 Bill: $175, Budget $150 150 150

14-Feb-99 Payment: $150 0 0

3-Mar-99 Bill: $200, Budget $150 200 150

15-Mar-99 Payment: $150 50 0


2-Apr-99 Adj: Mar 3, 97 bill incorrect due to

meter exchange discrepancies;

manual correction of -$33.


17 0


Notice the adjustment of -$33 affects only payoff amount. This is because the customer is on a budget. The adjustment will
not affect their monthly payment and therefore it doesn't affect how much they think they owe.

The following table describes the various types of service agreements where these balances may differ.

Type Of Service Agreement What Payoff Balance Holds What Current Balance Holds


Deposit Payoff balance holds the amount of deposit

you are holding on behalf of the customer's

debt. This amount is showed as a credit (with

a negative sign) because you truly owe the

customer this money.

Charitable contribution N/A - charitable contribution service

agreements never have a payoff balance.

Payment arrangements Payoff balance holds the total amount of

delinquent debt that remains unpaid. When a

payment arrangement is started, you transfer

the payoff balance from the utility service

agreement to the payment arrangement

service agreement. Each billing period, the

customer pays down this balance.

Utility agreements on a budget plan Payoff balance holds the actual amount owed

(actual bills minus payments).

Loans Payoff balance holds the payoff amount for

the loan, which is the current balance (the

billed loan amount) plus the principal balance


Current balance holds the amount the

customer owes for a deposit.

Current balance holds the amount the

customer owes for a charitable contribution.

Current balance holds the amount the

customer owes in respect of the billed

payment arrangement amounts.

Current balance holds the amount the

customer owes in respect of the billed budget

amount.

Current balance holds the amount the

customer owes in respect of the billed amount

(the periodic payment amount).


-----

(the unbilled loan amount) and any accrued

interest charges.

###### Adjustment Type And Balances

When you create an adjustment, you must define its adjustment type. The adjustment type controls how payoff balance and
current balance are affected by the adjustment amount.

You can only pick adjustment types that make sense for the service agreement. For example, if your organization doesn't
allow budget billing, all adjustments for a utility service agreement will affect payoff balance and current balance the same
(you can't get the balances out-of-sync).

The various types of adjustments that may be linked to a service agreement are controlled by the adjustment profiles defined
on the service agreement's SA type.

**FASTPATH:**
Refer to Adjustment Type Controls Everything for more information.

###### Canceling Adjustments

You may cancel any frozen adjustment. Canceling the adjustment creates another financial transaction that reverses the
financial effects of the original adjustment. The impact of the cancellation appears on the customer's next bill. You may
view both the original financial transaction and its cancellation on the Adjustment page.

###### Transfer Adjustments

A convenient mechanism exists to transfer moneys between two service agreements. The net effect of such a request is the
creation of two adjustments, each of which is linked to the other. Both adjustments are created together, frozen together,
and posted to the GL together. This is useful because you can't create one side of the transfer and without the other. Refer to
How To Create A Transfer Adjustment for more information.

**NOTE:**
**Inter or Intra Account. It's important to be aware that the transfer can be inter or intra account (i.e., the accounts on the**
two adjustments may be different).

###### Calculated Adjustments

An adjustment can calculate the adjustment amount using an algorithm. A calculated adjustment can be used to calculate:

- Sales or other taxes for a base amount

- Any charge amount based on a user-supplied quantity, such as feet, miles, hours, etc.

- Others.... Any calculation that can be made by a rate can be applied to an adjustment.

When you create a calculated adjustment, you may be asked to supply a base amount. The user may supply the base amount
or the amount could be defaulted from the adjustment type and possibly overridden by the user prior to calculating the
adjustment amount.


-----

When the adjustment is generated, the calculation algorithm may use the base amount and calculation date. The base
package algorithm calls the rate application and returns the calculated amount with calculation lines and GL distribution
codes.

An adjustment's adjustment type controls whether the adjustment is calculated and the algorithm that performs the
calculation.

**FASTPATH:**
For more information, refer to Adjustment Type Controls Everything and Setting Up Calculated Adjustment Types.

###### Adjustment Amount May Be Positive, Negative, Or Zero

An adjustment's amount may be positive, negative or zero:

- A positive amount causes the customer's balance(s) to increase.

- A negative amount causes the customer's balance(s) to decrease.

- A zero amount will not affect the customer's balance(s). A zero amount is odd, but necessary when you need to use an
adjustment to correct the GL distribution. Refer to How To Use An Adjustment To Change Amounts Booked In Your
GL for more information.

###### Adjustment Type Controls Everything

When you create an adjustment, you must define its adjustment type. The topics in this section describe how adjustment
type controls the behavior of an adjustment.

###### Controls Which Balance(s) Are Affected

The adjustment type's financial transaction (FT) algorithm controls how payoff balance and current balance are affected by
the adjustment amount.

###### Defines The GL Account Affected By The Adjustment

Most adjustments affect the general ledger (GL) in some way. The following points describe the source of these GL
accounts.

- For normal adjustments (i.e., non-calculated adjustments that affect a single service agreement), there is a single
accounting entry generated:

  - One side of the accounting entry is taken from the distribution code on the SA type of the service agreement affected
by the adjustment. For example, if you are adjusting the payoff balance on a normal service agreement, the A/R
account is constructed from the distribution code on the service agreement's SA type.

  - The other side of the accounting entry is taken from the distribution code on the adjustment's adjustment type. For
example, if a late payment charge is created, the "late payment charge" adjustment type references this fee's revenue
account.

- For transfer adjustments (i.e., adjustments used to transfer moneys between two service agreements), there are two
accounting entries generated - one for the "from" side and one for the "to" side. Each adjustment carries its own set of
balanced GL accounting details.


-----

  - For each adjustment, one side of the entry is taken from the distribution code on the SA type of the service agreement
affected by the adjustment (just like for normal adjustments).

  - The other sides of both accounting entries have the same GL account. This account should be the intermediate
clearing GL account that is to be used for the transfer. The source of this clearing GL account is the distribution code
on the adjustment type used to transfer the funds.

- For calculated adjustments (i.e., adjustments where rates may be applied to calculate the adjustment amount), there is a
single accounting entry:

  - For each adjustment, one side of the entry is taken from the distribution code on the SA type of the service agreement
affected by the adjustment (just like for normal adjustments).

  - The other side of the entry is taken from the distribution codes that resulted from the rate calculation if the adjustment
financial transaction algorithm is set up to use the calculation lines as the distribution code source. If the adjustment
financial transaction algorithm is set up to use the adjustment type as the distribution code source, the other side of the
accounting entry is taken from the distribution code on the adjustment type.

**NOTE:**
**Not all adjustments affect the GL. As a general rule of thumb, only those adjustments that affect a service agreement's**
payoff balance affect the GL. So, if you adjust a budget customer's current balance, but don't adjust their payoff balance,
the GL is not affected.

###### Defaults The Adjustment Amount

The adjustment type may default the adjustment amount in one of the following ways:

- The adjustment type may specify a default amount. This would be used for those adjustment types that have a standard
charge for all customers that receive this adjustment, for example a non-sufficient funds charge.

- The adjustment type may specify a default adjustment amount algorithm. This would be used for those adjustment types
that have a charge that varies based on other factors. For example, a non-sufficient funds charge may be based on a
customer's credit rating.

When an amount is defaulted onto a new adjustment it may be overridden by a user.

###### Calculates The Adjustment Amount

Some adjustment types calculate the adjustment amount. If the adjustment type uses a calculated amount, a base amount is
passed to the rate application, which then returns the calculated amount with calculation lines and GL distribution codes.

The adjustment type's generate adjustment algorithm controls which rate is applied to the base amount. A user supplied
calculation date controls which version of the rate is used. The user may supply the base amount or it may be defaulted from
the adjustment type and possibly overridden by the user prior to calculating the adjustment amount.

###### Controls The Interface To A/P & 1099 Reporting

If the adjustment type is associated with a payment (e.g. a refund or a loan disbursement) of money to a customer, the
adjustment type indicates such with a reference to an A/P request type.

When an adjustment that references an A/P request type is frozen, an A/P download request record is created. This record is
the interface request to ask your A/P system to cut a check. This interface record is marked with a batch process ID and run
number.


-----

- The batch process ID is the background process responsible for creating the flat file that contains check request that is
interfaced to your account's payable system. The batch process ID is defined on Installation Options - Financial. The
base package is supplied with a skeletal background process (APDL) that must be populated with logic to format the
records in the format compatible with your accounts payable system.

- The run number is the batch process ID's current run number.

**FASTPATH:**
Refer to Accounts Payable Check Request for more information.

If the resultant check needs to be reported for income tax purposes under a specific 1099 category, the category is also
specified on the adjustment type. The 1099 category is in turn interfaced to the A/P system (the system does NOT manage
1099 reporting).

###### Controls Information Printed On The Bill

If the adjustment appears on the customer's next bill, the verbiage is specified on the adjustment type (and may NOT be
overridden on the adjustment).

###### Controls If The Adjustment Can Be Frozen Prior To Bill Completion

Refer to Preventing SA Balances And The GL From Being Impacted Until Bill Completion for how adjustment type can
control whether adjustments of a given type can be frozen prior to bill completion.

###### Controls If The Adjustment Requires Approval

If an adjustment's adjustment type references an approval profile, the system will not allow the initiating user to freeze
the adjustment. Rather, the initiating user can submit the adjustment for approval. When an adjustment is submitted for
approval, the system determines the necessary approval levels and notifies the first approver. The system will freeze the
adjustment when last approver approves the adjustment (if the adjustment's adjustment type allows it to be frozen prior to
the completion of the next bill).

**NOTE:**
**Only online adjustments are subject to approval. The system assumes that no approval is necessary for adjustments**
created by batch processes even those whose adjustment type references an approval profile.

**FASTPATH:**
Refer to The Big Picture of Adjustment Approvals for more information.

###### Unbilled Adjustments And Aged Debt

A Frozen adjustment waits in limbo until the customer's next bill is produced. This limbo period could be several weeks if
the customer is billed infrequently. When the customer's next bill is completed, all limbo adjustments are linked to the bill.
A brief description (as defined on the adjustment type) appears on the printed bill.

It is important to stress the following in respect of these limbo adjustments:


-----

- If the adjustment decreases the amount of debt, the customer's aged debt is affected immediately regardless of whether
the adjustment appears on a bill.

- If the adjustment increases the amount of debt, the amount the customer owes from an aged debt perspective may or may
not be affected by the adjustment. There is a switch on the financial transaction created for the adjustment called New
Charge that controls the arrears behavior. When the FT for this type of adjustment is created, the switch is set to on and
the customer's aged debt will not reflect the adjustment amount until the adjustment is swept onto a bill. The moment the
adjustment is swept onto the customer's bill, the debt starts aging. A user may turn the switch off to cause the debt to start
aging sooner. For this case, the date on which the adjustment starts aging must be defined in the Arrears Date field.

- The amount a customer owes in total is immediately affected by the adjustment regardless of whether the adjustment
appears on a bill. This means that amount of aged debt may not be in sync with the total amount owed. This seems odd
but is useful from a credit and collections perspective. You see, you probably don't want to start aging an adjustment
until the customer has actually seen it.

###### An Adjustment May Affect More Than Just Customer Balances

**FASTPATH:**
When an adjustment is frozen or cancelled, a customer's current and payoff balances are affected. However, several
other objects may be affected when such events occur. Refer to Obscure Things That Can Happen for more information.

##### Maintaining Adjustments

An adjustment is used to change the amount of debt stored on a service agreement. The topics in this section describe the
pages on which adjustments are maintained.

**FASTPATH:**
For more information about adjustments, refer to The Big Picture Of Adjustments.

###### The Lifecycle Of An Adjustment

The following diagram shows the possible lifecycle of an adjustment.

**WARNING:**
This diagram only makes sense in the context of the page used to maintain Adjustments. Refer to Adjustment - Main
Information for the details.


-----

**NOTE:** Even though New is considered a valid adjustment state, this is only used as default when adding an adjustment.
Once the adjustment is saved, it is assigned the appropriate state in the adjustment life cycle. An adjustment will never
exist in the New state.

Adjustments are initially created in the Incomplete state. Adjustments in this state don't have a financial transaction. This
means, you can change the adjustment type and amount at will.

Click Generate to generate a financial transaction for the adjustment. The financial transaction contains the adjustment's
effect on the general ledger and on the customer's payoff and current balances. If the adjustment is calculated, the algorithm
on the adjustment type's Generate Adjustment event controls how the adjustment is calculated. If the adjustment is
calculated, you must specify the calculation date, which is passed as a parameter to the calculation algorithm and is used for
calculations that are effective dated (e.g., rate version or bill factor value). The financial transaction (FT) algorithm defined
on the adjustment type Adj. Financial Transaction event controls how the financial transaction is constructed. For calculated
adjustments, the distribution code may be taken from the adjustment type or the calculation lines.

After generating the financial transaction, the adjustment becomes Freezable. While in this state, you may change the
service agreement, adjustment type and amount at will. However, if you change this information, you will have to
regenerate the financial transaction (by clicking the Generate button).

In the very rare situation when the system cannot generate the financial transaction because of inconsistent setup data, the
adjustment is moved to the Error state. You may regenerate the financial transaction after correcting the source of the error.
You may also delete such an adjustment.

Click the delete button to physically remove an Incomplete, Error or Freezable adjustment from the database.

**WARNING:**
Please be aware that you can prevent specific types of adjustments from being frozen until the account's next bill is
completed. Refer to Preventing SA Balances And The GL From Being Impacted Until Bill Completion for how to
enable this feature on your adjustment types.


-----

Click Freeze to freeze the adjustment and its financial transaction. After doing this, the adjustment's state becomes Frozen.
While in this state, you cannot change the adjustment's type or amount, but you may change:

- When the adjustment starts aging.

- Whether the adjustment appears on a customer's bill.

- The accounting date used to derive the general ledger accounting period(s) to which the financial transaction is booked.

**NOTE:**
**Adjustments may require approval. If the adjustment type referenced on the adjustment has an approval profile, the**
Freeze button is replaced with a Submit for Approval button. If an adjustment is currently being approved, all action
buttons are disabled because the adjustment must be either approved or rejected using the Adjustment - Approval page.

However, the Delete button is enabled for an adjustment in a freezable state and linked to an approval request that is in a
“no approval necessary” state. If the adjustment is deleted a log entry is created on the associated approval request.

Refer to The Big Picture of Adjustment Approvals for more information.

If you need to remove the financial effects of an adjustment, click Cancel. Canceling an adjustment causes the generation of
another financial transaction. This new financial transaction reverses the financial impact of the original adjustment.

###### Adjustment - Main Information

**FASTPATH:**
The Description of Page section below describes the fields on this page. Refer to How and When To Use An
Adjustment for instructions describing how to perform common maintenance functions.

The Main page contains core adjustment information. Open this page using Menu > Financial > Adjustment > Search.

**WARNING:**
All adjustments reference a very important field that controls much validation and processing; this field is called
Adjustment Type. Take special care when adding a new adjustment to specify the appropriate Adjustment Type as it
affects how the adjustment appears on the customer's bill, how the adjustment is reflected in your general ledger, and
much more. After the adjustment is frozen, you may not change its Adjustment Type.

**Description of Page**

**Adjustment Info contains a concatenation of the adjustment amount, adjustment type and status.**

**NOTE:**
**Formatting may be performed by a plug-in. The contents of Adjustment Info may be formatted by a plug-in**
algorithm on the Adjustment Type. Refer to the base package's C1-ADT-INFO for an example. If such an algorithm is
not plugged-in on the Adjustment Type, the system looks for a corresponding algorithm on the installation record. Refer
to the base package's C1-ADI-INFO for examples. If you prefer different formatting logic, your system administrator
should configure the system appropriately.

**Adjustment ID is the system-assigned, unique identifier of the adjustment.**

**Account ID is the account to which the adjustment is linked. The name of the main person on the account appears next to**
the account ID.

Use Service Agreement ID to define the service agreement whose value needs to be adjusted. Basic information about the
service agreement appears adjacent.


-----

**Premise is a display-only field that shows the Service Agreement's characteristic premise (i.e., the primary premise**
associated with the service agreement).

Indicate the Adjustment Type. This field is very important as it controls numerous aspects of the adjustment's impact on
the customer's balance and your general ledger. This field is gray after the adjustment is frozen.

**NOTE:**
**You can only choose certain adjustment types. The service agreement's SA type has a collection of valid adjustment**
profiles. You may only reference adjustment types that are listed in one of the adjustment type profiles linked to the SA
type.

The list of adjustment types is also restricted to those without a CIS Division and those with a CIS Division that matches
the service agreement’s CIS Division.

Enter the Amount of the adjustment. If the adjustment type is a calculated adjustment, the Calculated Amount and
**Calculation Date are displayed. The values of the calculated amount and calculation date are displayed after the adjustment**
is generated. The calculated amount shows the result of the generate adjustment algorithm. The calculation date is
specified when you click Generate for a calculated adjustment type. It is used by the generate adjustment algorithm for any
calculations that are effective dated (e.g., rate version calculation group or bill factor value).

**NOTE:**
**Default note. The adjustment amount defaults based on the adjustment type. When you change the adjustment type, the**
amount changes accordingly. You may change the adjustment amount after it is defaulted.

**On Behalf SA ID is a display-only field that is only populated on system-generated adjustments instigated by one customer,**
but attributed to another customer. For example, if chargeable field work is performed for a customer, but is payable by the
customer's meter maintenance service provider, the adjustment will be linked to the service provider and will reference the
customer's SA as its On Behalf SA ID. This field is only visible if it is populated on the adjustment.

You may not change an adjustment's Adjustment Status directly. Rather, you use the buttons in the Adjustment Actions
area. Refer to The Lifecycle Of An Adjustment for the details.

If the status is canceled, the Cancel Reason is displayed.

Use the Comments to describe anything unusual about the adjustment.

The Creation Date defines the date on which the adjustment was created.

If the adjustment is subject to approval, a message indicating such appears. Clicking this message navigates the user to the
**Approvals tab. Refer to The Big Picture of Adjustment Approvals for more information.**

The financial transaction (FT) grid contains the financial transactions associated with the adjustment. It only contains
information after the adjustment is frozen. If the adjustment is canceled, a second row appears showing the details of the
cancellation FT.

- **Financial Transaction ID is the system-assigned unique identifier of the FT. Click the go to button to transfer to the**
financial transaction. On this page you can change certain aspects of the FT in question.

- **Arrears Date is the date the FT starts aging.**

- **Accounting Date is the date the system uses to determine the FT's accounting period in your general ledger.**

- **Current Amount contains the FT's effect on the service agreement's current balance.**

- **Payoff Amount contains the FT's effect on the service agreement's payoff balance.**

- **Bill ID is the bill on which the FT appears (if it has been swept onto a bill). Click the adjacent go to button to transfer**
to the bill on which the FT appears. Note: an FT is linked to a bill the next time a bill is completed for the service
agreement's account.

The Calculation Lines grid contains the details of the calculations associated with a calculated adjustment. It only appears
if the rate that calculated the adjustment amount created at least one calculation line. One row exists for every calculation

involved in the process. This information is for audit purposes only and cannot be modified. The following information
displays in the grid:

- If at least one of the calculation lines has characteristics, Calc Line Char displays go to buttons, allowing you to go to
characteristics that are linked to a specific adjustment calculation line. This column is only displayed if at least one of the
calculation lines has characteristics.

- **Sequence is the system-assigned unique identifier of the calculation detail row.**

- **Description on Bill is the information about the calculation line that appears on the customer's bill.**

- **Calculated Amount is the calculated amount associated with the calculation line.**

- The Print switch controls whether information about this line will print on the customer's bill.

- The Appears in Summary switch defines if this line's amount also appears on a summary line. This switch plays a
part at bill print time - those lines that appear in a summary print in the left dollar column, those that don't appear in a
summary print in the right dollar column.

- **Unit of Measure (UOM) is the unit of measure of the service quantity priced on the calculation line.**

- **Time of Use (TOU) is the time-of-use code of the service quantity priced on the calculation line.**

- **SQI is the service quantity identifier of the service quantity priced on the calculation line.**

- **Billable Service Quantity is the service quantity priced on the calculation line. This quantity differs from the measured**
consumption if there are pre-processing calculation groups in effect.

- **Base Amount is used by calculation lines (e.g. taxes) that are cross-referenced to other calculation lines and whose**
value(s), therefore, depend on the amounts calculated by those other lines. The Base Amount shows the total amount
derived from the cross-referenced line(s) that the current line then used to calculate its billed amount.

- **Rate Component Sequence refers to the sequence number of the rate component on the applicable rate version**
calculation group that was used to calculate the line. This is only populated if the original rate engine calculated the
charges.

- **Calculation Rule is the rule that calculated the line. This is only populated if the new rate engine calculated the charges.**

- **Measures Peak Qty is checked if the UOM priced on the calculation line is used to measure a peak quantity.**

- **Exempt Amount is the amount of the calculated charge that the customer doesn't have to pay because they are tax**
exempt.

- **Distribution Code is the distribution code associated with the calculation line. This distribution code is used to build the**
general ledger details on the bill segment's financial transaction.

- **Description describes the characteristic value that was used when the line's amount was calculated. This information**
is only displayed if the line was calculated using a bill factor (because only bill factors use characteristic values). Refer
toAn Illustration Of A Bill Factor And Its Characteristics for more information.

###### Adjustment - Transfer Adjustment

**FASTPATH:**
The Description of Page section below describes the fields on this page. Refer to How and When To Use An
Adjustment for instructions describing how to perform common maintenance functions.

The Transfer Adjustment is used to define the reciprocal adjustment associated with a transfer adjustment (there are always
two adjustments associated with a transfer). Open using Menu > Financial > Adjustment > Search.

The Main page describes one side of the transfer adjustment; for example, the “transfer from” adjustment. As well, the
Transfer Adjustment page describes the reciprocal adjustment; for example, the “transfer to” adjustment.

**Description of Page**

**Adjustment Info contains a concatenation of the adjustment amount, adjustment type and status.**

**Adjustment ID is the system-assigned, unique identifier of the adjustment.**

**Account ID is the account to which the adjustment is linked. The name of the main person on the account appears next to**
the account ID.

Use Service Agreement ID to define the transfer to service agreement. Basic information about the service agreement
appears adjacent.

**Premise is a display-only field that shows the Service Agreement's characteristic premise (i.e., the primary premise**
associated with the service agreement).


-----

The Adjustment Type and adjustment Amount from the first page are displayed. If you need to change either value, return
to the first page.

**Adjustment Status shows the status of the transfer to adjustment. If you need to change the adjustment's status, use the**
action buttons.

Use the Comments to describe anything unusual about the adjustment.

**Transfer Adj ID is the system-assigned, unique identifier of the adjustment.**

The Creation Date defines the date on which the adjustment was created.

The financial transaction grid contains the financial transactions associated with the adjustment. It only contains information
after the adjustment is frozen. If the adjustment is canceled, a second row appears showing the details of the cancellation
FT.

- **Financial Transaction ID is the system-assigned unique identifier of the FT. Click the go to button to transfer to the**
financial transaction. On this page you can change certain aspects of the FT in question.

- **Arrears Date is the date the FT starts aging.**

- **Accounting Date is the date the system uses to determine the FT's accounting period in your general ledger.**

- **Current Amount contains the FT's effect on the service agreement's current balance.**

- **Payoff Amount contains the FT's effect on the service agreement's payoff balance.**

- **Bill ID is the bill on which the FT appears (if it has been swept onto a bill). Click the adjacent go to button to transfer to**
the bill on which the FT appears. Note: an FT is linked to a bill the next time a bill is completed for the account.

###### Adjustment - A/P Request

**FASTPATH:**
The Description of Page below describes the fields on this page. Refer to How and When To Use An Adjustment for
instructions describing how to perform common maintenance functions.

The A/P Request page contains information about adjustments used to refund money via an A/P check request. This page is
only relevant if:

- The adjustment's adjustment type references an A/P Request Type (i.e., it will be interfaced to your accounts payable
system which will cut the check), AND

- The adjustment is frozen.

Open this page using Menu > Financial > Adjustment > Search and navigate to the A/P Request page.

**Description of Page**

**Adjustment Info contains a concatenation of the adjustment amount, adjustment type and status.**

**Adjustment ID is the system-assigned, unique identifier of the adjustment.**

**Account ID is the account to which the adjustment is linked.**

**NOTE:**
**Adjustment type controls A/P check requests. The A/P Request information is populated when an adjustment used to**
refund money via an A/P check request is frozen. Whether or not an adjustment is interfaced to A/P is controlled by the
adjustment's adjustment type. The adjustment type's A/P Request Type controls the payment date and the bank.

**Name is the name printed on the check. This name is derived from the account's main person:**

- If this person has an override mailing name, the first line of the override mailing name is used.


-----

- If this person does not have an override mailing name, the person's primary name is used.

**Payment Selection Status is the status of the check request. The values are:**

- Not Selected for Payment before it's selected by A/P for payment

- Requested for Payment after it's selected by A/P

- Paid after it's paid by A/P

- Canceled if it's been canceled in A/P

- Hold if it's been held in A/P

**Scheduled to Pay is the date on which the check is scheduled to be cut. This is equal to the adjustment date plus the Due**
Days on the adjustment type's A/P request type.

The following fields are provided in order to support a two-way interface with an A/P system. The system provides the
inbound web service C1-UpdateAPCheckRequest that can be used to update these fields.

- **PaymentDate is the date on which the check was cut in A/P. This field is only populated after A/P cuts the check.**

- **Paid Amount is the amount of the check. This field is only populated after A/P cuts the check.**

- **A/P Request ID is the system-assigned, unique identifier of the A/P check request.**

- **Payment Number is the system-assigned number of the payment in A/P (this number typically appears on the printed**
check). This field is only populated after A/P cuts the check.

The address information in the bottom frame is the address to which the check is mailed. This is the billing address of the
main customer linked to the account. After the adjustment is frozen, this information is automatically populated based on
the address information for the account. This information is only modifiable when the Payment Selection Status is Not
Selected for Payment.

##### How and When To Use An Adjustment

**NOTE:**


-----

**A last resort. Adjustments should be viewed as a last resort because you should correct the cause of errors, rather than**
the effect. For example, if a customer's bill is incorrect, you should fix the customer's rate / meter reads / contract terms
and then perform a cancel / rebill. Issuing an adjustment to fudge the balance is really just that - a fudge.

The topics in this section describe how to perform common adjustment maintenance functions.

###### How To Create A Transfer Adjustment

The following steps describe how to create a transfer adjustment on the Adjustment page.

**NOTE:**
You cannot use an adjustment type with a calculated amount for transfer adjustments.

**WARNING:**
These steps only make sense in the context of the page used to maintain Adjustments. Refer to Adjustment - Main
Information for the details.

To create a transfer adjustment:

- Specify the "transfer from" account and service agreement on the Adjustment - Main page.

- Specify the adjustment type and the amount and transfer to the Transfer Adjustment page.

- Specify the "transfer to" service agreement and click the Generate and Freeze buttons to generate and freeze the
adjustments' financial transactions. Please be aware that the Freeze button may be disabled for certain types of
adjustments. This is because you can prevent specific types of adjustments from being frozen until the account's next
bill is completed. Refer to Preventing SA Balances And The GL From Being Impacted Until Bill Completion for how to
enable this feature on your adjustment types.

###### How To Create A Calculated Adjustment

The following steps describe how to create a calculated adjustment on the Adjustment page.

**WARNING:**
These steps only make sense in the context of the page used to maintain Adjustments. Refer to Adjustment - Main
Information for the details.

To create a calculated adjustment:

1. Open Menu > Financial > Adjustment > Add and specify the Service Agreement that will receive the adjustment.

2. Specify the Adjustment Type that calculates the amount, and enter a base Amount.

3. Click Generate. The Generate dialog box opens.

4. In the resulting dialog box, specify an Accounting Date and Generation Reference Date. Click Calculate.

5. Click Freeze to freeze the calculated transactions.

The Calculation Date that you supply is used by the generate adjustment algorithm for any calculations that are effective
dated (e.g., rate version calculation group or bill factor value).


-----

Please be aware that the Freeze button may be disabled for certain types of adjustments. This is because you can prevent
specific types of adjustments from being frozen until the account's next bill is completed. Refer to Preventing SA Balances
And The GL From Being Impacted Until Bill Completion for how to enable this feature on your adjustment types.

###### How To Cancel An A/P Adjustment After It Has Been Selected By A/P

Adjustments that are interfaced to A/P (because A/P needs to cut a refund check) sometimes need to be canceled. You
may cancel an A/P adjustment in the CIS system while its A/P request is Not Selected. If the A/P request is Requested for
Payment or Paid you must first cancel the payment in A/P. Canceling the payment in A/P changes the A/P request in CIS to
Canceled. At this point, you can cancel the adjustment in CIS.

###### How To Correct Normal Service Agreement Debt

If a customer is unhappy with the balance on a "normal" service agreement and you cannot fix the source of their
unhappiness (i.e., the bills and payments), create an adjustment. Simply select an adjustment type that describes why you
are adjusting the balance and enter the amount of the adjustment (a negative number if you are crediting the customer).

**NOTE:**
**What's normal? There really is no such thing as a "normal" service agreement. We use this term to reference service**
agreements used to bill for services like utility service, land leases, home warranties, security monitoring, etc. where the
current amount is the same as the payoff amount.

**WARNING:**
A service agreement that is part of a budget plan is NOT normal. Refer to How To Adjust A Service Agreement On A
Budgetfor more information.

###### How To Apply Ad Hoc Fees To A Service Agreement

If you need to apply a fee (e.g., late payment charge, connection charge, NSF charge) to a "normal" service agreement,
issue an adjustment using the appropriate adjustment type. The adjustment amount should be a positive number so that the
customer's balance increases.

**WARNING:**
Take care if you apply a fee to a service agreement that's on a budget. The adjustment affects current balance and payoff
balance by the amount of the fee. If you didn't mean to affect the customer's current balance, you'll have to issue another
adjustment to change it.

###### How To Apply Interest To A Deposit

**FASTPATH:**
You should only have to issue adjustments to calculate and refund interest if you need to override the system's
automated procedures. Refer to Controls Interest Calculation for the details.


-----

If you need to manually apply interest to a deposit, issue an adjustment using the appropriate adjustment type. The
adjustment amount should be a negative number (you are crediting the customer's deposit balance).

If you want to apply the interest to the customer's outstanding balance, refer to How To Apply A Deposit To Outstanding
Debt.

If you want to cut a check for the deposit, refer to How To Refund A Deposit With A Check.

###### How To Apply A Deposit To Outstanding Debt

**FASTPATH:**
You should only have to issue adjustments to apply a deposit to outstanding debt if you need to override the system's
automated procedures. Refer to Refunding Deposits for the details.

Applying a deposit is a two-step process:

- The deposit service agreement's payoff balance contains the amount of deposit you are holding on behalf of the
customer's debt. Its current balance should be zero (i.e., the customer doesn't owe any additional deposit). Before you
apply the deposit balance, we recommend making the deposit's current balance equal to the amount to be transferred.
You do this by issuing an adjustment that just affects the deposit's current balance. The amount of this adjustment should
be a negative number.

- After the deposit's current balance reflects an appropriate credit amount (equal to the amount to be applied to the
customer's debt), use the Transfer Adjustment process to apply the deposit's credit balance to another service agreement's
debit balance. The deposit service agreement is the transfer from service agreement; the delinquent service agreement
is the transfer to service agreement. The adjustment amount should be a positive number. Refer to How To Create A
Transfer Adjustment for more information.

**WARNING:**
Take care if you apply a deposit to a service agreement that's on a budget. The transfer adjustment affects current
balance and payoff balance by the same amount. If you didn't mean to affect the customer's current balance, you'll have
to issue another adjustment to change it.

###### How To Refund A Deposit With A Check

**FASTPATH:**
You should only have to issue adjustments to apply a deposit to outstanding debt if you need to override the system's
automated procedures. Refer to Refunding Deposits for the details.

Refunding a deposit with a check (cut by your A/P system) is a two step process:

- The deposit service agreement's payoff balance contains the amount of deposit you are holding on behalf of the
customer's debt. Its current balance should be zero (i.e., the customer doesn't owe any additional deposit). Before you
refund the deposit balance, we recommend making the deposit's current balance equal to the amount to be refunded. You
do this by issuing an adjustment that just affects the deposit's current balance. The amount of this adjustment should be a
negative number.

- After the deposit's current balance reflects an appropriate credit amount (equal to the amount to be refunded), issue a
refund adjustment. The adjustment amount should be a positive number. This adjustment causes a check request to be
interfaced to your A/P system.


-----

###### How To Write-Down Deposit Due

If a customer doesn't pay their deposit and you don't expect them to, create an adjustment to write-down the current balance.
Simply select an adjustment type that describes why you are adjusting the balance and enter the amount of the adjustment (a
negative number).

###### How To Refund A Credit Balance With A Check

If you need to refund a credit balance on a "normal" service agreement, issue a refund adjustment using the appropriate
adjustment type. The adjustment amount should be a positive number. This adjustment causes a check request to be
interfaced to your A/P system.

**WARNING:**
Take care if you refund a credit balance from a service agreement that's on a budget. The adjustment affects current
balance and payoff balance by the amount of the refund. If you didn't mean to affect the customer's current balance,
you'll have to issue another adjustment to change it.

###### How To Transfer A Credit Balance To A Service Agreement In Arrears

Use the Transfer Adjustment process to apply a "normal" service agreement's credit balance to another service agreement's
debit balance. The credit service agreement is the transfer from service agreement; the delinquent service agreement is the
transfer to service agreement. The adjustment amount should be a positive number. Refer to How To Create A Transfer
Adjustment for more information.

**WARNING:**
Take care if you apply a credit to a service agreement that's on a budget. The transfer adjustment affects current balance
and payoff balance by the transfer amount. If you didn't mean to affect the customer's current balance, you'll have to
issue another adjustment to change it.

###### How To Change The Age Of Debt

If a service agreement's debt is older (or younger) than what it should be (for whatever reason), you should do the
following.

- Use the Transfer Adjustment process to re-age the debt. The transfer from and transfer to service agreements will be the
same. The adjustment amount should be a negative number. Refer to How To Create A Transfer Adjustment for more
information.

- After creating the transfer adjustment, drill into the transfer to adjustment and populate the arrears date with the day on
which the debt should start aging (e.g., if the debt should be 7 days old, the arrears date should be the current date minus
7 days).

**WARNING:**


-----

Be careful if you transfer debt from a service agreement that's on a budget. Before doing the transfer, you should make
the customer's current balance equal their payoff balance.

###### How To Write-Down A Charitable Contribution Service Agreement Debt

If a customer doesn't want to contribute as much to the charity as the agreed to, create an adjustment to fix the current
balance (charity service agreements shouldn't have a payoff balance as the "debt" is voluntary). Simply select an adjustment
type that describes why you are adjusting the balance and enter the amount of the adjustment (a negative number).

###### How To Write-Off Debt

To write-off debt:

**WARNING:**
You don't have to do the tasks outlined below if you use the Write Off - Main page. This page does these tasks for you.

- Create a write-off service agreement using the Start Service page (you could also use the Service Agreement page to do
this).

- Use the Transfer Adjustment process to transfer the delinquent debt to the to the write-off service agreement. The
original service agreement is the transfer from service agreement; the write-off service agreement is the transfer to
service agreement. The adjustment amount should be a negative number. Refer to Transfer Adjustments for more
information.

**WARNING:**
Take care if you transfer debt from a service agreement that's on a budget. Before doing the transfer, you should make
the service agreement's current balance equal their payoff balance.

###### How To Cancel A Service Agreement's Budget

**WARNING:**
You don't have to do the tasks outlined below if you use the Account - Budget panel. This panel does these tasks for
you.

Canceling a service agreement's budget involves the following steps:

- Update the service agreement to indicate the service agreement is no longer on a budget.

- Issue an adjustment to make the service agreement's current balance equal the payoff balance.

**NOTE:**
**Credit and collections (C&C). You can change the arrears date on the adjustment that synchronizes current and payoff**
balance to reflect the true age of the debt. You do this on the financial transaction associated with the adjustment. If you
do this, C&C will monitor the old debt accordingly.


-----

###### How To Adjust A Service Agreement On A Budget

If you need to adjust the debt on a service agreement that's on a budget plan, you have to ask yourself why you're adjusting
the balance:

- If you're adjusting the balance to correct the payoff balance (for whatever reason), choose an adjustment type that just
affects this balance.

- If you're adjusting the balance to correct the current balance (for whatever reason), choose an adjustment type that just
affects this balance.

- If you need to adjust both balances equally, choose an adjustment type that affects both.

###### How To Adjust An Installment Plan Service Agreement

If you need to adjust the debt on a service agreement that's used to bill a total amount in installments, you have to ask
yourself why you're adjusting the balance:

- If you're adjusting the balance to correct the payoff balance (for whatever reason), choose an adjustment type that just
affects this balance.

- If you're adjusting the balance to correct the current balance (for whatever reason), choose an adjustment type that just
affects this balance.

If you need to adjust both balances equally, choose an adjustment type that affects both.

###### How To Use An Adjustment To Change The GL Distribution

Assume you have a frozen bill segment that affected an incorrect GL distribution code (e.g., it booked revenue to
commercial - time-of-use - revenue and it should have booked it to industrial - time-of-use - revenue. You have two ways to
correct such a situation:

- You could correct the cause of the incorrect distribution code (probably incorrect GL information on a calculation rule/
pricing rule) and cancel / rebill the bill segment. Refer to Cancel / Rebill for more information about this method.

- You could create an adjustment that does not impact the customer's balance but does have a GL entry. This GL entry
would reverse the effect of the original distribution code and have an offsetting entry to the correct distribution code. The
following points explain how to do this:

- Choose an adjustment type that only impacts the GL (i.e., the adjustment's adjustment type has an FT algorithm that
doesn't impact the customer's current or payoff balance, it only impacts the GL).

- Enter an adjustment amount of zero.

- Generate the adjustment.

- Drill into the adjustment's financial transaction and enter two (or more) GL distribution rows that reflect the
redistribution of the amounts.

- Return to the adjustment and freeze it.

**NOTE:**


-----

**Adjusting statistical amounts. You can use the above approach to change the statistical amount that is interfaced to the**
general ledger. The statistical amount is simply another column on the financial transaction's GL distribution rows.

###### The Lifecycle of an Adjustment Staging Control Record

The following diagram shows the possible lifecycle of an adjustment staging control record.

- Pending. An adjustment staging control record is created in this state. The C1-ADUP1 process selects pending
adjustment staging control records for validation.

- In Progress. The C1-ADUP1 process sets a pending record to in progress when the totals on the adjustment staging
control are successfully validated against the totals from the associated adjustment upload staging records.

- Complete. The C1-ADUP2 process sets the adjustment staging control's status to complete when all adjustment upload
staging records linked to the adjustment staging control are complete.


-----

- Error. The C1-ADUP1 process sets a pending record to error if the adjustment staging control fails validation. The status
may be set back to pending after the error is fixed.

- Held. The held status is available for situations where you want to prevent or delay the upload of a batch of adjustment
staging records. The status may be set back to pending when the batch of records is ready for upload.

- Pending, error and held records may be deleted.

###### The Lifecycle of an Adjustment Upload Staging Record

The following diagram shows the possible lifecycle of an adjustment upload staging record.

- Pending. Adjustment upload records are created in this state. The C1-ADUP2 process selects pending adjustment upload
records and creates adjustments for each of them.

- Complete. The C1-ADUP2 process sets a pending record to complete if an adjustment is successfully created.

- Error. Either C1-ADUP1 or C1-ADUP2 process sets pending record to error when it encounters an error during the
upload process. The status may be set back to pending after the error is fixed.

- Pending and error records may be deleted.

###### Process C1-ADUP1 - Preprocess Adjustment Uploads

The background process (C1-ADUP1) validates adjustment staging control records and populates service agreement IDs on
adjustment upload staging records that do not specify an SA ID.


-----

###### Phase 1 - Validate Adjustment Staging Controls

The following points describe, at a high level, the first phase of the adjustment upload pre-process:

- For each Pending adjustment staging control,

- Check that the record count on the adjustment staging control record equals the number of adjustment upload staging
records that are linked to the adjustment staging control.

- Check that the total adjustment amount on the adjustment staging control record equals the sum of the adjustment
amounts from the adjustment upload staging records that are linked to the adjustment staging control.

- If the adjustment staging control passes validation, set its status to In Progress. Otherwise, set the status to Error. Create
a To Do entry using the inputs To Do type and To Do role (if supplied) for adjustment staging control errors. (Complete
any outstanding To Do entries for the adjustment staging control before creating a new To Do entry.)

- If no errors occur, perform To Do cleanup by completing any outstanding To Do entries that were previously created for
the adjustment staging control.

**NOTE:**
You can fix errors by going to the To Do entry and drilling into the adjustment staging control page. Don't forget to
change the adjustment staging control's status back to Pending after fixing the error.

###### Phase 2 - Populate SA ID

The following points describe, at a high level, the second phase of the adjustment upload pre-process:

- For each Pending adjustment upload staging that is linked to an In Progress adjustment staging control AND does not
have the SA ID,

- Execute the Determine SA algorithm that is plugged in on the adjustment type.

- If the algorithm returns a valid SA ID, stamp that SA ID onto the adjustment upload staging. If the algorithm also returns
an indication that the adjustment is to be put into suspense, set the suspense flag on the adjustment upload staging to In
Suspense. Refer to Suspense Adjustments for more information on how suspense adjustments are handled.


-----

- If the algorithm returns an error, set the adjustment upload staging record's status to Error. Create a To Do entry using the
inputs To Do type and To Do role (if supplied) for adjustment upload staging errors. (Complete any outstanding To Do
entries for the adjustment upload staging before creating a new To Do entry.)

- If no errors occur, perform To Do cleanup by completing any outstanding To Do entries that were previously created for
the adjustment upload staging.

**NOTE:**
You can fix errors by going to the To Do entry and drilling into the adjustment upload staging page. Don't forget to
change the adjustment upload staging's status back to Pending after fixing the error.

###### Process C1-ADUP2 - Upload Adjustments

The background process (C1-ADUP2) creates adjustments for all adjustment upload staging records that are stamped with
an SA ID.

The following diagram and section describe, at a high level, the processing done in the C1-ADUP2 background process.

- For each Pending adjustment upload staging that has an SA ID,

- Add a frozen adjustment using the amount, creation date and adjustment type on the staging record.

**NOTE:**
If the type of adjustment being uploaded is one that is calculated, the algorithm that's plugged in on the adjustment
type will calculate the adjustment amount and generate associated calculation lines (if applicable). See Calculated
Adjustments for more information.

- If adjustment creation is successful, update the adjustment ID on the staging record and set the staging record's status to
Complete.

- If adjustment creation results in an error, set the staging record's status to Error. Create a To Do entry using the To Do
type on which this batch process ( C1-ADUP2 ) is defined as creation process. (Complete any outstanding To Do entries
for the adjustment upload staging before creating a new To Do entry.)


-----

- If no errors occur, perform To Do cleanup by completing any outstanding To Do entries that were previously created for
the adjustment upload staging.

###### Suspense Adjustments

 What Are Suspense Adjustments?

When the adjustment upload preprocessor is unable to identify a valid SA ID, it can post the adjustment to a suspense SA.
This is similar to how a payment is posted to a suspense account when a valid account ID could not be identified during
payment upload.

Putting adjustments in suspense is optional. Therefore, this logic sits in a plug-in spot. If suspense adjustments are
applicable to you, you must plug in your suspense logic in a Determine SA algorithm on Adjustment Type.

###### How Are Suspense Adjustments Resolved?

A background process can be run periodically to automatically resolve suspense adjustments. Since rules for resolving
suspense may vary, this logic sits in a plug-in spot. You must plug in your resolve logic in a Resolve Suspense algorithm on
Adjustment Type.

###### Process C1-ADURS - Resolve Suspense Adjustments

The batch process refers to the background process (C1-ADURS) that resolves suspense adjustments.

For each adjustment upload staging that is In Suspense, execute the Resolve Suspense algorithm that is plugged in on the
adjustment type.

#### Credit & Collection

The system periodically monitors how much your customers owe to ensure they haven't violated your collection criteria.
When a violation is detected, the system generates the appropriate events (e.g., letters, disconnect field activities, To Do
entries, write-off outstanding debt, etc.). This section describes how to manage your credit & collections processing.

**NOTE:**
In the section, The Big Picture Of Credit & Collection (C&C), we describe how to set up the control tables that automate
most of your credit & collections processing. If you set these tables up properly, the system will manage most of your
collection, severance and write-off processes; little or no user intervention should be necessary. You will only access the
C&C pages when you need to override what the system does.

##### The Big Picture Of Credit & Collection

The topics in this section provide background information about a variety of credit & collections issues.

###### Automating Your C&C Activities

**FASTPATH:**
Refer to The Big Picture Of Credit & Collections (C&C) to understand how the system monitors overdue debt and
initiates the appropriate collection, severance and write-off events when a customer exceeds your debt tolerances.

###### The Lifecycle Of A Collection Process And Its Events

The following diagram illustrates the lifecycle of a typical collection process and its collection events:


-----

The preceding diagram is referenced in the following topics.

###### What Is A Collection Process?

A collection process is a series of events (e.g., letters, To Do entries) meant to encourage an account to pay its delinquent
debt. Linked to the collection process are the specific service agreements that contributed to the delinquent debt.

###### How Are Collection Processes Created?

A collection process and its events may be created as follows:

- The Account Debt Monitor is a background process that creates a collection process when an account violates your
collection criteria. The collection process has one or more collection event(s). The collection process template associated
with the collection process controls the number and type of events.


-----

- A user may create an ad hoc collection process at will. The collection process template controls the number and type of
events linked to the collection process.

In the above diagram, the event on 1-Dec-99 shows the creation of a collection process with three collection events. Notice
that the events all exist in the Pending state. The events will exist in this state until their trigger date is on or before the
current date.

**FASTPATH:**
Refer to How Does The Account Debt Monitor Work? to understand how the system monitors overdue debt and initiates
the appropriate collection process when a customer exceeds your debt tolerances. Refer to The Big Picture Of Collection
Events for more information about a collection process' events.

When you enable the Control Central alert algorithm, C1-COLLPR-AC, an alert displays when an account has an active
collection process. This algorithm is plugged-in on the installation record.

###### How Are Collection Events Completed?

The event activator runs periodically (at least daily). It looks for collection events with a trigger date on or before the
current date. For each such event, the system executes its activity and then completes it.

In the above diagram, the event activator activates pending events on 1-Dec-99 and 16-Dec-99. Notice that the events are
moved to the Complete state.

**FASTPATH:**
Refer to The Big Picture Of Collection Events for more information about the various types of collection events and
what happens when they are completed.

###### How Are Collection Processes (and their Events) Canceled?

**FASTPATH:**
Refer to How Are Collection Processes Cancelled for a description of how and when collection processes are
automatically cancelled by the system.

Besides the automated cancellation process, a user may cancel a collection process at will. Refer to How To Cancel A
Collection Process for more information.

###### What Happens If A Payment Is Not Received?

If a payment (or some other type of credit) is not received by the trigger date of the last event in the process, a severance
process is initiated for one or more service agreements. Refer to The Last Collection Event Should Sever Service
Agreement(s) for more information.

###### The Collection Process Background Processes

There are three background processes that automate the creation, activation, and cancellation of collection processes:


-----

###### Account Debt Monitor

The Account Debt Monitor (ADM) creates a collection process when an account violates your collection criteria. The
collection process has one or more collection event(s). The number and type of events is defined on the collection process's
template.

This process has an optional input parameter for CIS Division. It can be used if you implementation requires processing of
data by CIS Division. You will need to create a copy of this process’s batch control for each CIS Division.

**NOTE:**
Monitoring account debt is usually done based a schedule triggered by system events such as a bill or canceled payment.
If too much time has gone by since the last debt review, the account can be selected for debt monitoring as well. ADM
has an optional input parameter Include Minimum Days Review. When set, accounts that have gone too long since
their last review are selected along with those scheduled to be reviewed. The minimum days between review is defined
on the customer class

A separate background process (ADM2) only selects accounts based on the minimum days. This process can be used
when the option to include minimum days on ADM has not been set. ADM2 does not have an option to be run by CIS
Division.

ADM2 does not have an option to be run by CIS Division.

In the above diagram, the account debt monitor creates a collection process (with 3 events) on 1-Dec-99. Notice that the
events all exist in the Pending state. The events will exist in this state until their trigger date is on or before the current date.

**FASTPATH:**
Refer to How Does The Account Debt Monitor Work for more information.

###### Collection Event Activator


-----

The Collection Event Activator (CET) runs periodically (at least daily). It looks for collection events with a trigger date on
or before the current date. For each such event, the system executes its activity and then completes it.

This process has an optional input parameter for CIS Division. It can be used if you implementation requires processing of
data by CIS Division. You will need to create a copy of this process’s batch control for each CIS Division.

In the above diagram, the collection event activator activates pending events on 1-Dec-99 and 16-Dec-99. Notice that the
events are moved to the Complete state after they are activated.

###### Collection Process Monitor

The Collection Process Monitor (CPM) runs periodically (at least daily). This process reviews a collection process
whenever one of its service agreements' debt is reduced.

This process has an optional input parameter for CIS Division. It can be used if you implementation requires processing of
data by CIS Division. You will need to create a copy of this process’s batch control for each CIS Division.

At review time, the Collection Process Monitor determines if it can cancel the collection process (because the customer's
debt is no longer in a bad state). Refer to How Does The Collection Process Monitor Work for details describing how this
process works.

In the above diagram, the collection process monitor cancels the process on 17-Dec-99. Notice that the events are moved to
the Cancelled state and the process becomes Inactive.

###### The Lifecycle Of A Severance Process And Its Events

The following diagram illustrates the first part of the lifecycle of a typical severance process and its events:


-----

The preceding diagram is referenced in the following topics.

###### What Is A Severance Process?

A severance process is a series of events (e.g., letters, To Do entries, field activities) that lead to the severance of a service
agreement. A separate severance process is required for each service agreement to be severed.

###### How Are Severance Processes Created?

Severance processes may be created as follows:

- The Collection Event Activator creates a severance process when it completes a "start severance process" collection
event. The severance process has one or more severance event(s). The severance process template associated with the
severance process controls the number and type of events.


-----

- A user may create an ad hoc severance process at will. The severance process template defined when the severance
process is created controls the number and type of events linked to the severance process.

**NOTE:**
**Manual Creation. A user can create a severance process for an account that does not qualify to be on severance**
according to the cancel criteria algorithm. For example, perhaps your cancel criteria algorithm cancels a severance
process when the account's debt falls below a threshold amount. A user can create a severance process for an account
whose debt is already below this threshold. Because cancellation is real time, there is no action that will cause this
severance process to be canceled. When a manual severance process is created, the system executes the appropriate
cancellation criteria algorithm. If the algorithm indicates that the system would have canceled this severance process, a
warning is issued. Refer to How Are Severance Processes Cancelled for more information about cancellation algorithms.

In the above diagram, the event on 18-Dec-99 shows the creation of a severance process with three collection events. Notice
that only the first event has a trigger date, this is because the later events' trigger date can only be determined after the first
event is completed. Also, notice that the events all exist in the Pending state. The events will exist in this state until their
trigger date is on or before the current date.

**FASTPATH:**
Refer to How Are Collection Events Completed? for more information about the completion of collection events.

When you enable the Control Central Alert installation algorithm, C1-SEVPR-ACT, an alert displays when an account
has an active severance process. This algorithm is plugged-in on the installation record.

###### How Are Severance Events Completed?

The Severance Event Activator runs periodically (at least daily). It looks for severance events with a trigger date on or
before the current date. For each such event, the system executes its activity. The type of severance event dictates what
happens to the severance event's state. Refer to Field Events Versus Office Events for the details.

In the above diagram, the event activator activates a pending event on 18-Dec-99. Take note of the state of the severance
event (it becomes Awaiting Field Activity Completion).

**FASTPATH:**
Refer to The Big Picture Of Severance Events for more information about the various types of severance events and
what happens when they are completed.

###### How Are Severance Processes (and their Events) Canceled?

**FASTPATH:**
Refer to How Are Severance Processes Cancelled for a description of how the system automatically cancels a severance
process.

**NOTE:**
**Real time cancellation. Unlike collection processes, the system cancels severance processes real time (i.e., there is**
no equivalent of the collection process monitor for severance processes). Why are severance processes canceled real
time? Because a severance process may have events that create field activities to sever service. These events need to be
canceled the moment the FT is frozen, we can't wait until a background process runs. This means that if a customer pays
in person for a service agreement that is pending severance, the system will cancel the process and its field activities


-----

(if any) the moment the payment is entered. The logic to cancel the field activities is in an algorithm plugged in on the
installation record.

**FASTPATH:**
Refer to Setting Up Severance Process Templates for more information about severance process templates. Refer to
Designing Your Reconnection Procedures for more information about how severance processes are used to reconnect
services.

Besides the automated cancellation process, a user may cancel a severance process at will.

###### What Happens If The Customer Does Not Pay?

If a payment (or some other type of credit) is not received by the trigger date of the last event in the severance process, the
service agreement is stopped (as long as you've setup your severance process to include an Expire Service Agreement event
as the last event). The expiration of the last service agreement will, in turn, trigger a final bill. If the account doesn't pay the
final bill, a write-off process will be started.

**NOTE:**
**Final bills. The account will be setup for final billing when the LAST service agreement linked to the account is**
stopped. Refer to Finalizing Pending Stops for more information about how the system changes the account's bill cycle
when the last service agreement is stopped.

**FASTPATH:**
Refer to The Big Picture Of Write Off Processing for more information about the write off process.

###### The Severance Process Background Processes

The Collection Event Activator creates a severance process when it completes a "start severance process" collection
event. The severance process has one or more severance event(s). The severance process template associated with the
severance process controls the number and type of events. There are 3 background processes that automate the activation
and cancellation of severance events:


-----

###### Severance Event Activator

The Severance Event Activator (SET) runs periodically (at least daily). It looks for severance events with a trigger date on
or before the current date. For each such event, the system executes its activity. The type of severance event dictates what
happens to the severance event's state.

This process has an optional input parameter for CIS Division. It can be used if you implementation requires processing of
data by CIS Division. You will need to create a copy of this process’s batch control for each CIS Division.

In the above diagram, the event activator activates a pending event on 18-Dec-99. Take note of the state of the severance
event (it becomes Awaiting Field Activity Completion ).

###### Completing Severance Events That Are Dependent On The Completion Of A Field Activity

The Complete Field Events (SEC) process runs periodically (at least daily). It looks for severance events that are dependent
on the completion of field activities before they can be completed. The system completes each such event when the field
activities linked to the event are complete.

This process has an optional input parameter for CIS Division. It can be used if you implementation requires processing of
data by CIS Division. You will need to create a copy of this process’s batch control for each CIS Division.

In the above diagram, this process completes the event that was Awaiting Field Activity Completion on 19-Dec-99. Take
note of the state of the severance event (it becomes Complete ).

###### Set Trigger Date

The Set Trigger Date (SED) process runs periodically (at least daily). It looks for severance events that are dependent on the
completion of other events before their trigger date can be set. The system sets the trigger date of each such event when all
of its dependent events are complete.


-----

This process has an optional input parameter for CIS Division. It can be used if you implementation requires processing of
data by CIS Division. You will need to create a copy of this process’s batch control for each CIS Division.

In the above diagram, this process sets the trigger date of the second event on 19-Dec-99.

###### The Lifecycle Of A Write-Off Process And Its Events

The following diagram illustrates the lifecycle of a typical write-off process and its write-off events:


-----

The above diagram is referenced in the following topics.

###### What Is A Write-Off Process?

A write-off process is a series of events (e.g., letters, collection agency referrals) meant to encourage an account to pay its
delinquent debt. Linked to the write-off process are the specific service agreements that contributed to the delinquent debt.

###### How Are Write-Off Processes Created?

A write-off process and its events may be created as follows:

- The Write Off Monitor is a background process (WPM) that creates a write-off process when an account has finaled,
unpaid service agreements. The write-off process has one or more write-off event(s). The write-off process template
associated with the write-off process controls the number and type of events.

- A user may create an ad hoc write-off process at will. The write-off process template controls the number and type of
events linked to the write-off process.

In the above diagram, the event on 15-Jan-00 shows the creation of a write-off process with three write-off events. Notice
that the events all exist in the Pending state. The events will exist in this state until their trigger date is on or before the
current date.

**FASTPATH:**
Refer to How Does The Write-Off Monitor Work? to understand how the system monitors overdue debt and initiates
the appropriate write-off process when a customer has unpaid, finaled service agreements. Refer to The Big Picture Of
Write-off Events for more information about a write-off process' events.

###### How Are Write-Off Events Completed?

The event activator runs periodically (at least daily). It looks for write-off events with a trigger date on or before the current
date. For each such event, the system executes its activity and then completes it.

In the above diagram, the event activator activates a pending event on 15-Jan-00. Notice that the events are moved to the
Complete state.

**FASTPATH:**
Refer to The Big Picture Of Write-off Events for more information about the various types of write-off events and what
happens when they are completed.

###### How Are Write-Off Processes (and their Events) Canceled?

When a stopped service agreement's balance is reduced to zero (i.e., it closes), the system checks if there is an ongoing
write-off process associated with the service agreement. If so:

- The system "removes" the service agreement from the write-off process.

- When the last service agreement is removed from a write-off process, the system cancels all pending write-off events and
deactivates the write-off process.

- If the canceled process has collection agency referrals, the system cancels the referrals.


-----

**NOTE:**
**Real time cancellation. Unlike collection processes, the system cancels write-off processes real time (i.e., there is**
no equivalent of the collection process monitor for write-off processes). This means that if a customer (or collection
agency) pays for a service agreement that is linked to write-off process, the system will cancel the process and its
collection agency referrals (if any) the moment the payment is entered.

**FASTPATH:**
Refer to Setting Up Write Off Process Templates for more information about write off process templates.

Besides the automated cancellation process, a user may cancel a write-off process at will.

###### What Happens If The Debt Is Not Paid?

If a payment (or some other type of credit) is not received by the trigger date of the last event in the process, the debt will be
written off (assuming you designed your write off process template to do such).

**NOTE:**
**The last write-off event should cause debt to be written off. Debt will only be written off if the last write-off event is**
the type that writes off debt. If the write-off process template contains no such event, nothing further will transpire until
the next time the write-off monitor runs (when it will create another write-off process for the unpaid, finaled debt).

**FASTPATH:**
Refer to How Is Debt Financially Written-Off? for a description of exactly how debt is written off.

###### How Is Debt Referred To Collection Agencies

**FASTPATH:**
Refer to How Do Collection Agency Referrals Work? for more information about how the system refers debt to a
collection agency.

###### The Write-Off Process Background Processes

There are 2 background processes that automate the creation, activation, and cancellation of write-off processes:

**NOTE:**
If necessary, you can write-off debt outside of the automated write-off process by simply transferring bad debt to a
write-off service agreement using the Write Off transaction.


-----

###### Write-Off Monitor

The Write-Off Monitor (WPM) is a background process that has two functions:

- It attempts to close Stopped and Reactivated service agreements using several methods as described under Attempt To
Close The SA Before Creating A Write Off Process.

- If it is unsuccessful at closing a SA, it creates a write-off process. The write-off process has one or more write-off
event(s). The write-off process template associated with the write-off process controls the number and type of events.

This process has an optional input parameter for CIS Division. It can be used if you implementation requires processing of
data by CIS Division. You will need to create a copy of this process’s batch control for each CIS Division.

In the above diagram, the event on 15-Jan-2000 shows the creation of a write-off process with three write-off events. Notice
that the events all exist in the Pending state. The events will exist in this state until their trigger date is on or before the
current date.

###### Write-Off Event Activator

The Write-Off Event Activator (WET) runs periodically (at least daily). It looks for write-off events with a trigger date on
or before the current date. For each such event, the system executes its activity and then completes it.

This process has an optional input parameter for CIS Division. It can be used if you implementation requires processing of
data by CIS Division. You will need to create a copy of this process’s batch control for each CIS Division.

In the above diagram, the write-off event activator activates a pending event on 15-Jan-2000. Notice that the event is moved
to the Complete state.

##### Collection Process Maintenance


-----

A collection process is a series of events (e.g., letters, To Do entries) meant to encourage an account to pay its delinquent
debt. Linked to the collection process are the specific service agreements that contributed to the delinquent debt. The topics
in this section describe the pages on which collection process-related information is maintained.

**FASTPATH:**
For more information about collection processes, refer to The Lifecycle Of A Collection Process And Its Events.

###### Collection Process - Main Information

The Main page contains core collection process information. Open this page using Menu > Credit & Collection >
**Collection Process > Search.**

**FASTPATH:**
The Description of Page section below describes the fields on this page. Refer to How To Perform Common Collection
Process Functions for more instructions describing how to use this transaction.

**Description of Page**

**Collection Process is a concatenation of summary information about this collection process. It is composed of the name of**
the main customer on the account, the collection status, the reason code for the collection status, the collection class control
name, and the creation date of the process.

**Collection Process ID is the unique system-generated identifier for this collection process.**

**Account ID is the system-generated account number. The name of the main customer on the account and its customer class**
are displayed next to the ID number.

**Collection Status defines the state of the collection process. The following values may exist:**

Active The system creates a collection process in the Active state. A collection process remains in this state until the last
event linked to the process is complete OR the customer pays the collection amount on the service agreements linked to the
process OR you want to stop the process for whatever reason.

Inactive A collection process becomes Inactive when the last event linked to the process is completed OR the customer pays
the collection amount on all service agreements linked to the process OR you want to stop the process for whatever reason.
The Reason field tells you how a collection process became inactive.

**FASTPATH:**
To completely understand the significance of a collection process' status, refer to The Lifecycle Of A Collection Process
And Its Events.

**Reason defines how a collection process became Inactive or why a collection process is Active. The following values may**
exist:

Canceled by User This reason should be used when a user manually inactivates a collection process (for whatever reason).

Canceled by System This reason is populated by the system when it cancels a collection process. The system automatically
cancels a collection process when sufficient credits have been posted to the process' service agreements since the process
was started.

Events Pending This reason is populated by the system when a process has pending events.

Completed This reason is populated by the system when it completes the last event linked to the collection process.

**Collection Class Control defines the debt class (i.e., the type of debt) associated with the collection process. This is**
important as it controls which service agreements can be linked to the collection process (every service agreement is
associated with a specific debt class). This field is gray when there are service agreements linked to the collection process.


-----

**NOTE:**
**Multiple collection processes may be linked to an account. It's important to be aware that if an account's service**
agreements reference multiple debt classes, a collection process must be created for each debt class that you want to
collect.

**One collection process per debt class. A given debt class for an account may only have one ongoing collection process**
at any point in time.

Beneath Collection Class Control is displayed a message showing why the system generated the collection process.
This information is only displayed for collection processes created by the Account Debt Monitor. If you have plugged in
a Collection Process Additional Information algorithm on the Installation record, the results of the algorithm, if any, is
displayed on a separate line.

The following line displays the minimum value payment to the collection process debt class that will cause cancellation of
the collection process.

**FASTPATH:**
For more information, refer to How Does The Account Debt Monitor Work?.

**Collection Process Template defines the collection events in the process. You can override these events on the Events**
page.

**NOTE:**
**Changing the template. If you change the template when all events are pending, the system will remove the pending**
events and replace them with the new template's events.

**FASTPATH:**
For more information, refer to Setting Up Collection Process Templates.

**Creation Date/Time defines the start date/time of the collection process. This is important as it affects the trigger dates of**
the process' collection events. This field becomes protected after the collection process exists on the database. If you need to
change the trigger date on the events you can navigate to the Events tab and change the dates manually. Alternatively, you
can perform the following "trick":

- Change the Collection Process Template to something (anything). Doing this causes the Create Date/Time to become
unprotected.

- Specify the date of the first collection event in the newly unprotected Create Date/Time.

- Change the Collection Process Template back to the desired value. When you change the template, the system removes
the events and creates new ones using the Create Date/Time.

The collection process cancellation logic will cancel a collection process when its account's debt no longer exceeds a given
amount (you define this threshold amount when you set up the system). Rather than compare an account's total debt to the
threshold amount, the cancellation logic compares the account's debt that is older than X days to the threshold amount. X is
the date specified in Collection Amount Base Date. You can have the system calculate this date for you by entering the age
of the arrears in the field embedded in Calculate Date Using ___ Days In Arrears.

agreement linked to the collection process, simply move to a field and change its value. To add a new service agreement,
press the + button to insert a row, then fill in the information for each field. The following fields display:

**Service Agreement ID identifies the service agreement being collected. Information about the service agreement is**
displayed beneath the SA ID.

**Status defines the state of the service agreement in respect of the collection process. The following values may exist:**

Active An Active service agreement is one currently being collected by the collection process. The service agreement will
remain in this state until the last event linked to the process is complete OR the customer pays the collection amount on the
service agreement OR you want to remove the service agreement from the collection process for whatever reason.

Inactive A service agreement becomes Inactive within the collection process when the last event linked to the process
is completed OR the customer pays the collection amount on the service agreement OR you want to remove the service
agreement from the collection process for whatever reason

The Collection Amount is the amount of debt that initially triggered the collection process. This will be zero for collection
processes that were created manually.

The Amount Still Owing is the amount of debt older than the Collection Amount Base Date defined on the Main page.

The Credit Amount is displayed if the Amount Still Owing is less than zero.

The SA Balances area displays how much is owed for the service agreement. The Days Old and Arrears Amount
information shows how old the current balance is. This information will be blank if the current balance is a credit.

**NOTE:**


-----

Information about debt balances by age is not applicable to open-item accounts.

**Current Balance indicates the amount the customer currently owes for the service. Payoff Balance indicates the amount**
the customer would owe if they wanted to close the service agreement. This value is only displayed when it differs from the
current balance.

###### How To Perform Common Collection Process Functions

The topics in this section describe how to perform common collection process maintenance functions. Refer to The
Lifecycle Of A Collection Process for more information about collection processes. Refer to The Big Picture Of Collection
Processing for high-level information about collection processing.

###### How To Create A Collection Process

99.9% of all collection processes are created by the Account Debt Monitor and require no human intervention before they
are executed (refer to How Are Collection Processes Created for information about how the account debt monitor creates
collection processes). The other 0.1% are created by users on-line / real time. The following points describe how to create
the 0.1%.

- Use Control Central to choose the account that requires a new collection process.


-----

- After the account is populated on Control Central, choose the Collection Process > Add option on the account context
menu to transfer to the collection process transaction in add mode.

- After the Collection Process - Main page appears, specify the appropriate Collection Class Control. Collection Class
**Control defines the debt class (i.e., the type of debt) associated with the collection process. This is important as it**
controls which service agreements can be linked to the collection process (every service agreement is associated with a
specific debt class). It's important to be aware that if an account's service agreements reference multiple debt classes, a
collection process must be created for each debt class that you want to collect. Also be aware that a given debt class for
an account may only have one ongoing collection process at any point in time.

- Choose a Collection Process Template. Collection Process Template defines the collection events in the process. You
can override these events on the Events page. For more information, refer to Setting Up Collection Process Templates.

- Use Collection Amount Base Date to define the arrears cutoff date that the system uses when it "removes" a SA from
a collection process. The system removes a SA from a collection process when its debt older than X is less than or equal
to zero. X is the date specified in Collection Amount Base Date. You can have the system calculate this date for you by
entering the age of the arrears in the field embedded in Calculate Date Using ___ Days In Arrears.

- Navigate to the SAs page to define the specific service agreement's whose debt is covered by this collection process. You
must define at least one service agreement.

- Save the collection process.

###### How To Change Collection Events

When a collection process is first created, it has one or more collection events. The events are the activities that will be
performed to persuade the customer to pay the outstanding debt.

The number and type of events that are created when a collection process is initiated are defined on the collection process's
collection process template. The following points describe how to add / change / delete events on a collection process if the
defaulted events are not satisfactory.

- Use Control Central to choose the account with the collection process whose events need to be changed.
After the account is populated on Control Central, choose the Collection Process > Search option on the account
context menu to transfer to the collection process transaction in update mode.

To add a new event, transfer to the Events tab and press the + button in the Collection Events scroll to add a new event.
At this point, the event has not been added to the database; rather, it just exists in memory. Before you add the event to
the database, you must specify the following information:

- Choose an Event Sequence so that the new event will be positioned properly in respect of the other events.

- Choose a Collection Event Status of Pending.

- Choose the desired Collection Event Type.

- Use Trigger Date to define the date on which the event should be activated (i.e., completed).
To delete an existing event, transfer to the Events tab and use the scroll arrows to toggle to the desired collection event.
When the desired collection event appears, press the - button to remove the event. At this point, the event has not been
removed from the database; rather, it's been removed in memory.

To change an existing event, transfer to the Events tab and use the scroll arrows to toggle to the desired collection event.
When the desired collection event appears, make the desired changes.

After all desired changes have been made, save the collection process.

###### How To Cancel A Collection Process


-----

The Collection Process Monitor will automatically "remove" service agreements from a collection process when their debt
has been reduced sufficiently. When all service agreements are "removed" from a collection process, the collection process
is canceled. The following points describe how to manually cancel a collection process.

- Use Control Central to choose the account with the collection process to be cancelled.

- After the account is populated on Control Central, choose the Collection Process > Search option on the account
context menu to transfer to the collection process transaction in update mode. A list of all collection processes associated
with the account appears. If only one collection process exists, it is automatically selected for you.

- On the Main tab, click Cancel.

- When the warning dialog appears, click OK to continue. The collection process and its pending events are canceled.

##### Severance Process Maintenance

A severance process is a series of events (e.g., field orders, letters, To Do entries) meant to encourage an account to pay its
delinquent debt. Linked to the severance process is the specific service agreement being severed. The topics in this section
describe the pages on which severance process-related information is maintained.

**FASTPATH:**
For more information about severance processes, refer to The Lifecycle Of A Severance Process And Its Events.

###### Severance Process - Main Information

The Main page contains core severance process information. Open this page using Menu > Credit & Collection >
**Severance Process > Search.**

**FASTPATH:**
The Description of Page section below describes the fields on this page. Refer to How To Perform Common Severance
Process Functions for more instructions describing how to use this transaction.

**Description of Page**

The top portion of every page in this page contains the following information:

**Severance Process is a concatenation of summary information about this severance process. It is composed of the name of**
the main customer on the account, the division and SA type, and severance process template code, the process status, the
reason code for the process status and the creation date of the process.

**Severance Process ID is the unique system-generated identifier for this severance process.**

The remaining fields are maintained on the main severance process page.

**Service Agreement ID is the system-generated identifier of the service agreement to which the severance process is linked.**
Adjacent to the ID number is summary information about the SA.

**Severance Status defines the state of the severance process. The following values may exist:**

Active The system creates a severance process in the Active state. A severance process remains in this state until the last
event linked to the process is complete OR the customer pays the collection amount associated with the severance process
OR you want to stop the process for whatever reason. The Reason field tells you why a severance process is still in the
active state.


-----

Inactive A severance process becomes Inactive when the last event linked to the process is completed OR the customer pays
the collection amount on the severance process OR you want to stop the process for whatever reason. The Reason field tells
you how a severance process became inactive.

**FASTPATH:**
To completely understand the significance of a severance process' status, refer to The Lifecycle Of A Severance Process
And Its Events.

**Reason defines how a severance process became Inactive or why a severance process is Active. The following values may**
exist:

Canceled by User This reason should be used when a user manually inactivates a severance process (for whatever reason).

Canceled by System This reason is specified by the system when it cancels a severance process. The system automatically
cancels a severance process when sufficient credits have been posted to the process' service agreement since the process was
started.

Events Pending This reason is specified by the system when a process has pending events.

Completed This reason is specified by the system when it completes the last event linked to the severance process.

**Severance Process Template defines the severance events in the process. You can override these events on the**
**SeveranceEvents page. If you change the template after events exist, the system will remove the existing events and**
replace them with the new template's events.

**FASTPATH:**
For more information, refer to Setting Up Severance Process Templates.

**Create Date/Time defines the start date/time of the severance process. This is important as it affects the trigger dates of the**
process' severance events. This field becomes protected after the severance process exists on the database. If you need to
change the trigger date on the events you can navigate to the Events tab and change the dates manually. Alternatively, you
can perform the following "trick":

- Change the Severance Process Template to something (anything). Doing this causes the Create Date/Time to become
unprotected.

- Specify the date of the first severance event in the newly unprotected Create Date/Time.

- Change the Severance Process Template back to the desired value. When you change the template, the system removes
the events and creates new ones using the Create Date/Time.

The Collection Amount is the amount of debt that initially triggered the severance process.

The Amount Still Owing is the amount of debt older than the Severance Amount Base Date.

The severance process cancellation logic will cancel a severance process when its SA's debt no longer exceeds a given
amount (you define this threshold amount when you set up the system). Rather than compare a SA's total debt to the
threshold amount, the cancellation logic compares the SA's debt that is older than X days to the threshold amount. X is the
date specified in Severance Amount Base Date. You can have the system calculate this date for you by entering the age of
the arrears in the field embedded in Calculate Date Using __ Days In Arrears.

**FASTPATH:**
For more information, refer to How Are Severance Processes (and their Events) Canceled?

Process Functions for more instructions describing how to use this transaction.

**NOTE:**
We strongly recommend that you understand the information described in How Are Write-off Events Completed? before
using this page.

**FASTPATH:**
The number and type of events associated with a write-off process are defined by the process's write-off process
template (which is defined on the first page). Refer to Setting Up Write Off Process Templates for more information.

**Description of Page**

The top portion of every page in this page contains the following information:

**Write Off Process is a concatenation of summary information about this write-off process. It is composed of the name of**
the main customer on the account, the write-off status, the reason code for the write-off status, the write-off class control
name, and the creation date of the process.

**ID is the unique system-generated identifier for this write-off process.**

The Write Off Events scroll contains individual write-off events that comprise the write-off process. Only one event is
displayed at a time. The grid contains the customer contacts that were created by the system when a particular write-off
event was triggered (if any).

**Event Sequence is the unique identifier of the event.**

**Write Off EventStatus defines the state of the event. The following diagram shows the possible lifecycle of a write-off**
event:


-----

Write-off events are initially created in the pending state.

When the system sees a pending event with a Trigger Date on or before the current date, the system executes the event's
activity and completes the event.

You can cancel an individual write off event by setting the status to cancelled.

The Write Off Event Type defines the event's activity (e.g., the related debt is referred to a collection agency, a To Do
entry is generated, a letter is sent).

**FASTPATH:**
For more information refer to Setting Up Write Off Process Templates.

The Trigger Date defines the date when the system completes (i.e., executes) the event.

**FASTPATH:**
For more information about a write-off event's trigger date, see Write-off Event Trigger Date.

If the status of the event is complete, the Completion Date is displayed with the date on which the system completed the
event. If the status of the event is cancelled, the Canceled Date is displayed with the date on which the event was cancelled.

The Customer Contact information contains information when the event template causes a letter to be generated (because
letters are created by customer contacts).

###### How To Perform Common Write-Off Process Functions

The topics in this section describe how to perform common write-off process maintenance functions. Refer to The Lifecycle
Of A Write-off Process for more information about write-off processes. Refer to The Big Picture Of Write-off Processing
for high level information about write-off processing.

###### How To Create A Write-Off Process

99.9% of all write-off processes are created by the Write-Off Monitor and require no human intervention before they are
executed (refer to How Are Write-off Processes Created for information about how the account debt monitor creates writeoff processes). The other 0.1% are created by users on-line / real time. The following points describe how to create the
0.1%.

- Use Control Central to choose the account that requires a new write-off process.


-----

- After the account is populated on Control Central, choose the Write Off Process > Add option on the account context
**menu to transfer to the write-off process transaction in add mode.**

- After the Write-off Process - Main page appears, specify the appropriate Write Off Control. Write Off Control defines
the debt class (i.e., the type of debt) associated with the write-off process. This is important as it controls which service
agreements can be linked to the write-off process (every service agreement is associated with a specific debt class).
It's important to be aware that if an account's service agreements reference multiple write-off debt classes, a write-off
process must be created for each write-off debt class that you want to collect.

- Choose a Write Off Process Template. Write Off Process Template defines the write-off events in the process. You
can override these events on the Events page. For more information, refer to Setting Up Write-off Process Templates.

- Navigate to the SAs page to define the specific service agreement's whose debt is covered by this write-off process. You
must define at least one service agreement.

- Save the write-off process.

###### How To Change Write Off Events

When a write-off process is first created, it has one or more write-off events. The events are the activities that will be
performed in the course of the write-off process.

The number and type of events that are created when a write-off process is initiated are defined on the write-off process's
write-off process template. The following points describe how to add / change / delete events on a write-off process if the
defaulted events are not satisfactory.

- Use Control Central to choose the account with the write-off process whose events need to be changed.
After the account is populated on Control Central, choose the Write Off Process > Search option on the account
context menu to transfer to the write-off process transaction in update mode.

To add a new event, transfer to the Events tab and press the + button in the Write Off Events scroll to add a new event.
At this point, the event has not been added to the database; rather, it just exists in memory. Before you add the event to
the database, you must specify the following information:

- Choose an Event Sequence so that the new event will be positioned properly in respect of the other events.

- Choose a Write Off Event Status of Pending.

- Choose the desired Write Off Type Code.

- Use Trigger Date to define the date on which the event should be activated (i.e., completed).
To delete an existing event, transfer to the Events tab and use the scroll arrows to toggle to the desired write-off event.
When the desired write-off event appears, press the - button to remove the event. At this point, the event has not been
removed from the database; rather, it's been removed in memory.

To change an existing event, transfer to the Events tab and use the scroll arrows to toggle to the desired write-off event.
When the desired write-off event appears, make the desired changes.

After all desired changes have been made, save the write-off process.

###### How To Cancel A Write-Off Process

The system will automatically "remove" service agreements from a write-off process when the close (i.e., when their
balance becomes zero). When all service agreements are "removed" from a write-off process, the write-off process is
cancelled. Refer to How Are Write off Processes and Events Cancelled for more information.

The following points describe how to manually cancel a write-off process.

- Use Control Central to choose the account with the write-off process to be cancelled.


-----

- After the account is populated on Control Central, choose the Write Off Process > Search option on the account
context menu to transfer to the write-off process transaction in update mode. A list of all write-off processes associated
with the account appears. If only one write-off process exists, it is automatically selected for you.

- On the Main tab, click Cancel.

- When the warning dialog appears, click OK to continue. The write off process and its pending events are canceled.

##### Writing Off Uncollectable Debt

The Write-off pages described in this section describe the transaction used to manually transfer bad debt to a write-off
service agreement.

###### Write Off - Main

Most write-offs happen behind-the-scenes as part of the automated write-off processing. If you need to perform a partial
write-off or cannot wait for the automated process, open Menu > Credit & Collection > Write Off > Search.

**FASTPATH:**
Refer to The Big Picture of Write Off Processing for background information about the write-off process.

**Description of Page**

**Account contains the name of the main customer on the account. The Account ID is the account whose debt is being**
written off.

The Candidate SAs scroll contains one row for each of the account's service agreements that is eligible for write-off. The
system displays the respective age and amount of each SA's debt. The accumulated total of all such debt appears in Write
**Off Amount. The checkbox adjacent to this field is used to confirm that you want to write-off the adjacent debt.**

When you click the Create button, the system writes off the selected debt by executing the write-off algorithm that's
plugged in on the account's customer class. Refer to The Ramifications of Write Offs in the General Ledger for an
explanation of how the base-package algorithm (CCWO-DST) works.

###### How To Manually Write-Off Debt

To manually write-off debt:

- Select the Account in question on Write Off - Main.

- Select the debt to be written off for each Candidate SA. You do this by turning on the checkbox adjacent to Write Off
**Amount. You can also vary the amount of the Write Off Amount.**

- Click the Create button.

###### Write Off - Write Off SAs

The Write Off SAs page shows all write-off service agreements linked to the account along with their respective current and
payoff balance. Use Menu > Credit & Collection > Write Off > Search and navigate to the Write Off SAs page.

**Description of Page**


-----

**Account contains the name of the main customer on the account. The Account ID is the account associated with the WO**
SAs displayed below.

The grid contains an entry for every write-off service agreement linked to the account. The following information is
displayed for each write-off service agreement:

- The service agreement's SA Information is displayed.

- **Current Balance contains the WO SA's current balance (i.e., the amount written off).**

- **Payoff Amount contains the WO SA's payoff balance (i.e., the amount written off).**

**NOTE:**
**Write off SA. There is a field on SA type called Special Role. Only those SA types with a role of Write Off are**
displayed.

##### Collection Referral

The Collection Referrals page contains information about an account's debt that has been referred to a collection agency.

**FASTPATH:**
Refer to How Do Collection Agency Referrals Work? for more information about how the system creates and maintains
collection agency referrals as part of the automated write off processing. In theory, you need only access this page if you
need to override the automated processing.

Open Menu > Credit & Collection > Collection Agency Referral > Search to maintain this information.

**Description of Page**

The Agency Referrals scroll contains one entry for every collection agency referral associated with the account. The
following information is defined for each referral.

Use Collection Agency to define the agency to which the referral is being sent.

**Start Date is the date on which the referral was initially created.**

**Referral Status defines if the referral is Active or Closed.**

Use Comments to describe anything unusual about the referral.

The grid contains the history of interactions with the collection agency. Each time an account's debt is referred to a
collection agency, the system creates a referral history record.

You can communicate changes about the referral by inserting a new row in the collection. For example,

- If you need to change the referral amount, insert a row and indicate the Creation Date and a Referral History Reason
of Change Referral.

- If you need to cancel the referral, insert a row and indicate a Referral History Reason of Referral Cancellation.

- If the customer pays, insert a row and indicate a Referral History Reason of Referral Paid.

- If you need to add a new referral, insert a row and indicate a Referral History Reason of Initial Referral.

Collection agency referral records are interfaced to the respective collection agency using the batch process defined on the
collection agency control record (refer to Setting Up Collection Agencies). The Batch Control process and the respective
**Batch Number in which the records were interfaced to the collection agency are displayed adjacent.**

The System Generated switch is on for those collection agency referrals created as part of the automated write-off
processing. Refer to How Do Collection Agency Referrals Work? for more information.

###### Downloading Collection Agency Referrals

Collection referral records need to be periodically extracted and sent to collection agencies.

**C1-CAGYX - Collection Agency Referral Extract**
This batch was developed using the plug-in driven extract template. It contains a select record and process record algorithm.
The records can be extended to include custom fields that your implementation needs. The process records algorithm type
delivered with the system, C1-CAGYX-PR, contains instruction for extending the record.

###### Collection Agency Extract Record

The topics in this section describe the information that appears on each collection agency extract record type.

##### Payment Arrangements and Pay Plans

Payment arrangements and pay plans are very similar concepts in that they are both used to payoff debt. This section
describes each method.

**NOTE:**
To distinguish between payment arrangements and pay plans, it is helpful to understand some terminology: 1) an
agreement with a customer to pay off their debt as part of their future bills (sometimes referred to as "current bill plus")
is a payment arrangement, 2) an agreement with specifically scheduled payments is called a pay plan.

###### Setting Up Payment Arrangement Requests

A payment arrangement request is used to manage the step-by-step process of starting a payment arrangement. These steps
can include: checking the account’s eligibility for a payment arrangement, capturing the terms of the payment arrangement


-----

(i.e. amount of the outstanding debt to include in the payment arrangement, down payment amount, installment details,
etc.), performing required approvals, monitoring the payment of an applicable down payment, and the actual creation of the
payment arrangement service agreement. Refer to The Big Picture Of Payment Arrangement Requests for more information

The topics in this section describe how to set up a payment arrangement request.

###### Starting A Payment Arrangement Request

There are multiple ways start a payment arrangement request:

- From Control Central:

  - Select the Account.

  - Navigate to the Payment Agreements tab page

  - On the Payment Arrangement Requests zone, click on the New Payment Arrangement button.

- From the Main Menu: Navigate using Menu > Credit & Collection > Payment Arrangement Request > Add.

- From the Payment Arrangement Request Search portal, click on the Add button on the page header.

- From a page/zone that displays the Account: On the Account context menu, navigate using Go To Payment
**Arrangement Request > Add.**

All navigation options launch the Payment Arrangement Request Process Flow, which will take you through each of the
steps needed to set up a payment arrangement request.

###### Maintaining Payment Arrangement Requests

A payment arrangement request is used to start a payment arrangement. Aside from capturing the agreed upon terms of the
payment arrangement (such as the service agreements and debts to include, number of installments and installment amount),
it can also manage any applicable prerequisites for starting the payment arrangement, e.g. down payments, approvals, etc.

Refer toThe Big Picture Of Payment Arrangement Requests for an overview of payment arrangement request functionality.

This section describes how to view and maintain payment arrangement requests.

Navigate using Menu > Credit & Collection > Payment Arrangement Request > Search. You are brought to a query
portal with options for searching for payment arrangement requests.

Once a payment arrangement request record has been selected, you are brought to the maintenance portal to view and
maintain the selected record.

The Payment Arrangement Request zone shows the details of the payment arrangement request. Refer to the zone’s
embedded help for more information.

The Notes zone allows users to capture additional notes on the payment arrangement request.

###### Payment Arrangement Request Process Flow

The base product provides a Payment Arrangement Request process flow type that includes three steps:

- Execution of one or more eligibility criteria, to determine whether or not the account is eligible for a payment
arrangement. The results of each eligibility criteria and the overall eligibility result are displayed on the first panel of the
process flow

- Setting up the terms of the payment arrangement:

  - The service agreements and debt to include in the payment arrangement

  - If a down payment must be paid prior to starting the payment arrangement, the down payment amount can be a
percentage or a fixed-amount portion of the total payment arrangement amount


-----

  - The remaining payment arrangement amount (after down payment, if applicable)

  - The number of installments

  - The installment amount

- Review of the eligibility results and the agreed upon payment arrangement terms before submitting the payment
arrangement request

Refer to the Payment Arrangement Request process flow panels for more details. Also refer to Understanding Process
Flows for information about how process flows work, in general.

###### Viewing Payment Arrangement Request History

An account’s payment arrangement request history can be viewed on the Payment Arrangement Requests zone of the
Control Central – Payment Agreements page. Refer to this zone’s embedded help for more details.

###### Setting Up Payment Arrangements

A payment arrangement is an agreement with a customer to payoff severely overdue debt in installments. Bills sent to
customers with payment arrangements contain charges for both their current services and their payment arrangement
installment amount. Refer to The Big Picture Of Payment Arrangements for information about the financial ramifications of
payment arrangements and for a description of how the system monitors payment arrangements.

The topics in this section describe how to set up a payment arrangement and how to break a payment arrangement (if a
customer doesn't fulfill their obligations).

###### Pay Arrangement - Main

**NOTE:** This page is used to create the payment arrangement service agreement. If you require eligibility checking and
other prerequisites for starting a payment arrangement, set up a Payment Arrangement Request instead.

This page allows you to set up a payment arrangement. When you create a payment arrangement, the system performs the
following functions:

- It creates a payment arrangement service agreement (PA SA). It sets the installment amount on this service agreement
equal to the installment amount specified on this page.

- It transfers delinquent debt from each delinquent service agreement(s) to the new PA SA.

- As it transfers the debt to the PA SA, it creates synchronizing adjustments to reduce the PA SA's current balance by
the amount transferred. Why? Because when delinquent debt is transferred to the PA SA, its current balance increases.
Because current balance contains the amount the customer currently owes, this balance must be reduced because the
customer is going to payoff the debt in installments (and therefore they don't currently owe anything on the PA SA).

**NOTE:**
**Payment Arrangement Algorithm. The system only performs the above steps if the new PA SA's SA Type does not**
reference a Payment Arrangement algorithm. If your implementation uses a Payment Arrangement algorithm, then the
logic performed when a payment arrangement SA is created will depend on this algorithm.

You could do the above functions by adding a new service agreement (using the service agreement page) and creating
transfer adjustments (using the adjustment page). However, this is tedious. Rather, open Menu > Credit & Collection >
**Payment Arrangement > Add to set up a payment arrangement.**


-----

**Description of Page**

**SA (service agreement) Info and SA ID are displayed on every page. These values only appear after the payment**
arrangement service agreement (PA SA) exists on the database. The ID is a system assigned random number that stays with
the payment arrangement service agreement for life. The SA Info is a concatenation of important details about the payment
arrangement service agreement and its account.

The Current Balance that appears beneath SA Info contains the PA SA's current balance. When you initially set up a PA
SA this balance will be zero. It is only non-zero if the customer has not paid a billed installment.

**Payoff Balance beneath SA Info contains the PA SA's payoff balance. The payoff balance is the total amount to be paid off**
over the PA SA's life. It is only non-zero after delinquent funds have been transferred to the PA SA. This balance is only
displayed when it differs from the Current Balance.

**FASTPATH:**
Refer to Current Amount versus Payoff Amount for more information.

**Account contains the name of the main customer on the account. Account ID is the account associated with the PA SA.**

The occurrences of Current and Payoff Balance below Account are the account's respective balances. These values are
displayed to help you confirm exactly how much the customer currently owes versus how much they will have to payoff
over time (remember, after you transfer funds to a payment arrangement, the amount transferred is reduced from the
account's current balance).

The Candidate SAs scroll contains one row for each of the account's service agreements with aged debt. The system
displays the respective age and amount of each SA's debt. All debt that is checked will be transferred to the PA SA when
you click Create.

**WARNING:**
The system automatically indicates that all debt that isn't "new" (i.e., debt that the customer has seen on their bills)
should be transferred to the payment arrangement. It does this by checking each parcel of aged debt.

**Total is the sum of ALL current balances (not just the checked amounts) from all candidate SAs.**

The next two fields are used to populate the arrangement amount (i.e., the amount the customer will be billed on each bill).

- The Installments field exists to calculate the Arrange Amount (the next field) when a time period has been stipulated.
Simply enter the number of installments and tab out. When you tab out of the field, the system sets the Arrange Amount
equal to New Payoff Balance / Installments.

**NOTE:**
**Arrange Amount may not add up. The Arrange Amount is rounded up so that if you multiply the number of**
installments by the calculated installment amount, the result will be greater than the PA SA's payoff amount. Don't
worry - only the actual dollar amount of the PA SA's total debt will be billed by the system. The last installment will be
slightly lower than the other installments.

- Use the Arrange Amount field to define the payment arrangement's installment amount if a specific dollar amount has
been stipulated. For example, if the customer agrees to pay off their delinquent debt by paying an additional $50 on each
bill, you'd enter "50" in this field. Note - If you enter a dollar amount in this field and tab out, the system will calculate
the number of installments and display the number in the Installments field.

**New Payoff Balance contains the PA SA's payoff balance. This is the total amount of debt that will be paid off over the**
lifetime of the PA SA. This value equals the current payoff balance on the PA SA plus all selected debt from the Candidate
**SAs scroll.**

Define the CISDivision and SA Type of the payment arrangement service agreement.

**NOTE:**


-----

**Payment arrangement SA types. There is a field on SA type called Special Role. Only those SA types with a role of**
Payment Arrangement may be selected.

Clicking Create (or Change)causes the system to perform the following:

- It adds / updates a payment arrangement service agreement (PA SA). It sets the installment amount on this service
agreement equal to the installment amount specified on the page.

- It transfers delinquent debt from the delinquent service agreement(s) to the PA SA. The adjustment type used to transfer
these funds is defined on the PA SA's SA type.

- It reduces the current balance on the PA SA by the amount of debt transferred to the PA SA. Why? Because when
delinquent debt is transferred to the PA SA, its current balance increases. Because current balance contains the
amount the customer currently owes, this balance must be reduced because the customer is going to pay off the debt
in installments (and therefore they don't currently owe anything). The adjustment type used to transfer these funds is
defined on the PA SA's SA type.

**NOTE:**
**Payment Arrangement Algorithm. The system only performs the above steps if the new PA SA's SA Type does not**
reference a Payment Arrangement algorithm. If your implementation uses a Payment Arrangement algorithm, then the
logic performed when a payment arrangement SA is created will depend on this algorithm.

You can transfer to the History page to view the transfer adjustments that were created by the system when it transferred
the selected debt to the PA SA.

Clicking Break causes the PA SA to become broken. Please refer to the note below for what transpires when a PA is
broken.

**NOTE:**
**Break logic is in a plug-in. Please be aware that the logic that is executed when a payment arrangement is broken**
exists in a plug-in algorithm (plugged-in on the PA SA's SA type). An implementation can use either a Break Payment
Arrangement algorithm which the system calls when a payment arrangement is broken, or the Payment Arrangement
algorithm which the system calls when a payment arrangement is created, canceled or broken. These two algorithms are
mutually exclusive on the SA Type.

**Break Payment Arrangement Algorithm. The base package algorithm (SAT BREAK PA) expires the PA SA and**
cancels all related frozen adjustments, returning the debt to the original service agreements. Because this logic is in a
plug-in, you can develop alternative logic and plug it in if the base package logic is not satisfactory.

###### How To Set Up A Payment Arrangement

**NOTE:** The following steps only apply to setting up payments using the Payment Arrangement – Main page.

To set up a new payment arrangement:

- Select the Account in question.

- Select the debt to be transferred to the payment arrangement (by turning on/off the checkbox adjacent to the Candidate
**SAs amounts).**

- Enter the number of Installments and the total Arrange Amount.

- Define the CIS Division and SA Type of the new payment arrangement service agreement.


-----

**NOTE:** If the service agreement’s account’s CIS Division’s Restrict to Account CIS Division flag is set to
_Restricted, the CIS Division is set to the account’s CIS Division and cannot be changed_

- Click the Create button.

###### How To Add Additional Debt To A Payment Arrangement

To transfer additional debt to an existing payment arrangement:

- Select the SA ID of the existing payment arrangement.

- Select the debt to be transferred to the payment arrangement (by turning on/off the checkbox adjacent to the Candidate
**SAs amounts).**

- Enter the number of Installments and the total Arrange Amount.

- Click the Create button.

**NOTE:**
**After transfer. After transferring the funds to the payment arrangement service agreement, confirm the account's payoff**
and current balances make sense (the payoff balance is the total amount of debt that the account will eventually have to
payoff, the current balance is how much they currently owe, i.e., the amount that credit and collections monitors). The
account's payoff and current balances are displayed in the page's second section. If you do not understand the difference
between payoff balance and current balance, refer to Current Amount versus Payoff Amount.

###### How To Break A Payment Arrangement

You would break a payment arrangement when a customer doesn't make the agreed payments. Typically, your credit
and collections processes will break a payment arrangement behind-the-scenes. Refer to The Big Picture Of Payment
Arrangements for information about how the system monitors payment arrangements.

If you want to manually break a payment arrangement simply select the SA ID of the existing payment arrangement and
click the Break button.

###### How To Cancel A Payment Arrangement

You would cancel a payment arrangement if you made a mistake and never intended to set up the payment arrangement in
the first place. To cancel a payment arrangement

- Select the SA ID of the existing payment arrangement and navigate to the History tab.

- Click the Cancel button to cancel the transfer adjustments that were used to transfer debt to the payment arrangement
from the customer's regular service agreements.

- Next, navigate to the payment arrangement SA's (PA SA) financial history page (using the service agreement context
menu). You will see that there are a few non-canceled adjustments (these were used to change the PA SA's current
balance after debt was transferred to the PA SA). Cancel these adjustments by drilling down on these adjustments and
then click the Cancel button on the adjustment maintenance transaction.

- Finally, display the PA SA on the service agreement maintenance transaction and cancel the payment arrangement.

**NOTE:**


-----

**Payment Arrangement Algorithm. If the payment arrangement SA's SA Type references a Payment Arrangement**
algorithm, then the logic performed when the PA SA is canceled will depend on this algorithm.

###### Pay Arrangement - History

Open Menu > Credit & Collection > Payment Arrangement > Search and navigate to the History page to view the
transfer adjustments that were created by the system when it transferred the selected debt to the PA SA.

**Description of Page**

**SA (service agreement) Info and ID are displayed on every page in this page. These values only appear after the payment**
arrangement service agreement (PA SA) exists on the database. The ID is a system-assigned random number that stays
with the service agreement for life. The SA Info is a concatenation of important details about the service agreement and its
account.

**Current Balance beneath SA Info contains the PA SA's current balance. When you initially set up a PA SA this balance**
will be zero. It is only non-zero if the customer has not paid a billed installment.

**Payoff Balance beneath SA Info contains the PA SA's payoff balance. The payoff balance is the total amount to be paid off**
over the PA SA's life. It is only non-zero after delinquent funds have been transferred to the PA SA. This balance is only
displayed when it differs from the Current Balance.

Refer to Current Amount versus Payoff Amount for more information.

**Account contains the name of the main customer on the account. Account ID is the account associated with the PA SA.**

The occurrences of Current and Payoff Balance below Account are the account's respective balances. These values are
displayed to help you confirm exactly how much the customer currently owes versus how much they will have to payoff
over time (remember, after you transfer funds to a payment arrangement, the amount transferred is reduced from the
account's current balance).

The Adjustment Details area contains one row for each transfer adjustment used to transfer delinquent debt to the PA SA.
Click the Go To button to transfer to the adjustment page to view the details of an adjustment (or to cancel the adjustment if
you want to reinstate the debt on the originating service agreement).

**Total Frozen Adj is the total amount of debt transferred to the payment arrangement that has not been canceled.**

Clicking Cancel causes the system to cancel all related frozen adjustments, returning the debt to the original service
agreements. You must specify the cancel reason by selecting it from the drop down list when Payment Arrangement
Cancellation window is displayed.

**Total Canceled Adj is the total amount of debt transferred to the payment arrangement that has been canceled.**

###### Setting Up Pay Plans

A pay plan (PP) is an agreement with a customer to make specific payments on specific dates (as opposed to payment
arrangements where the customer makes fixed payments as part of their regular bills).

Consider the following situations that would require a pay plan:

- A customer makes a request to payoff severely overdue debt in one or more installments. The existence of the pay plan
insulates the portion of the debt covered by the plan from C&C processing (specifically, from the account debt monitor).

- A commercial or industrial customer cannot or will not post a deposit. This type of pay plan is not specifically paying off
past debt; rather, it can be viewed as an installment plan to prepay a regular service agreement.


-----

The topics in the following section describe how to set up a pay plan.

###### Pay Plan - Main

The pay plan transaction allows you to set up a pay plan. When you create a pay plan, the system performs the following
functions:

- It creates an active pay plan using the pay plan type entered.

- It defaults the customer as the payor if no third party is defined.

**FASTPATH:**
Refer to The Big Picture Of Pay Plans for information about the financial ramifications of pay plans and for a
description of how the system monitors pay plans.

Open Menu > Credit & Collection > Pay Plan > Search to maintain a customer's pay plan.

**Description of Page**

**Pay Plan and Pay Plan ID only appear after the pay plan is added to the database. Pay Plan ID is a system-assigned**
random number that stays with the pay plan for life. Pay Plan is a concatenation of important details about the pay plan.

**Account ID identifies the account of the customer for which the pay plan exists. This field is protected once the pay plan is**
Active.

The Status displays the status of the pay plan. Refer to The Lifecycle Of A Pay Plan for more information about a pay
plan's status.

**Created by displays the id of the user who created the pay plan and the date and time on which it was created.**

Clicking the Cancel button causes the pay plan's status to become cancelled.

**Last Updated by displays the id of the user who last modified the pay plan and the date and time on which it was changed.**

Select a Pay Plan Type. The Pay Plan Type defines the Debt Class whose debt is insulated by the pay plan. The account's
**Current Balance in this debt class appears beneath as well as the portion that is considered Delinquent Debt.**

If a 3rd party is responsible for the pay plan's payment, Third Party Payor must be checked, and the associated 3rd party
selected.

The Payor Account Id contains the account ID and name of the person responsible for making the pay plan's payments. If
a Third Party Payor is responsible, the payor's account appears; otherwise the account whose debt is insulated by the pay
plan appears.

The Start Date defines the first day on which the pay plan is tracked; it defaults to the current date.

**Pay Method defines the manner in which the customer intends to fulfill payments under this pay plan.**

**NOTE:**
**Significance of payment method. A pay method can have a grace period associated with it. This period controls when**
a scheduled payment is considered to be missed. For example, a pay method of "postal" might have a grace period of 3
days. This would give the customer 3 extra days to make the scheduled payments before the pay plan is broken.

In addition to grace period, pay method also control if the system will automatically create an automatic payment on the
scheduled payment date. If the pay method so indicates AND the account has been set up for automatic payment, the
PPAPAY background process will create Automatic Payments on the scheduled payment date.

The Scheduled Payments grid contains the pay plan's scheduled payments. The Scheduled Date and Scheduled Amount
must be entered for each scheduled payment. The Total Amount of the scheduled payments is displayed at the bottom.

Free format Comments can be entered to describe any special notes about the pay plan.

###### How To Set Up A Pay Plan

To set up a new pay plan:

- Select the Account in question on Pay Plan - Main.

- Select the Pay Plan Type for the type.

- Identify a Third Party Payor if there is one.

- Select a Pay Method.

- Enter one or more Scheduled Payments. The Total Amount of the scheduled payments should cover the customer's
**Delinquent Debt if you want the pay plan to protect the customer from additional credit and collection activity.**

- Click the Save button.

###### Reviewing Pay Plans

In addition to using this maintenance page for reviewing pay plans, Control Central has a pay plan tree that can be used to
view pay plan history, including current status. Refer to Pay Plan Tree for more information.

#### Financial Transactions

In this section, we describe the financial transactions generated as a result of your bills, payments and adjustments.

##### The Big Picture Of Financial Transactions

The topics in this section provide background information about a variety of financial transaction issues.

**FASTPATH:**
We strongly recommend familiarizing yourself with the topics described in The Financial Big Picture to fully appreciate
the system's financial architecture.

###### Bill Segment Financial Transactions

A bill segment has a related financial transaction. The financial transaction contains the financial effects of the bill segment
on the service agreement's current and payoff balances and on the general ledger.

If a bill segment is cancelled, another financial transaction is created to reverse the original financial transaction. The
cancellation financial transaction appears on the next bill produced for the account as a bill correction.

**FASTPATH:**
For more information about bill segment financial transactions, refer to Bill Details.


-----

###### Payment Segment Financial Transactions

A payment segment has a related financial transaction. The financial transaction contains the financial effects of the
payment segment on the service agreement's current and payoff balances and on the general ledger.

If a payment segment is cancelled, another financial transaction is created to reverse the original financial transaction. The
cancellation financial transaction appears on the next bill produced for the account as a negative payment.

**FASTPATH:**
For more information about payment segment financial transactions, refer to Payment Details.

###### Adjustment Financial Transactions

An adjustment has a related financial transaction. The financial transaction contains the financial effects of the adjustment
on the service agreement's debt and on the general ledger.

If the adjustment is eventually cancelled, another financial transaction will be linked to the adjustment to reverse its
financial effect. The cancellation financial transaction appears on the next bill produced for the account as an adjustment.

**FASTPATH:**
For more information about adjustment financial transactions, refer to Adjustment Details.

###### Financial Transactions And Aged Debt

When a financial transaction's related bill segment / payment segment / adjustment is frozen, the financial transaction (FT)
is also frozen. When an FT is frozen, its service agreement's debt is impacted. It is important to stress the following in
respect of this impact:

- The FT's GL details will be interfaced to the GL when the GL interface next executes.

- If the FT decreases the amount of debt, the customer's aged debt is affected immediately regardless of whether the FT
appears on a bill.

- If the FT increases the amount of debt, the amount the customer owes from an aged debt perspective may or may not be
affected by the FT. There is a switch on an FT called New Charge that controls the arrears behavior. If this switch is on,
the customer's aged debt will not reflect the FT amount until the FT is swept onto a bill. The moment the FT is swept
onto the customer's bill, the debt starts aging. If this switch is off, the date on which the FT starts aging must be defined
in the Arrears Date field.

- The amount a customer owes in total is immediately affected by the FT regardless of whether the FT appears on a bill.
This means that the amount of aged debt may not be in sync with the total amount owed. This seems odd, but is useful
from a credit and collections perspective. You see, you probably don't want to start aging a FT until the customer has
actually seen it.

###### Obscure Things That Can Happen

The topics in this section provide information about obscure things that can happen when a financial transaction (FT) is
frozen.


-----

###### A Stopped Service Agreement May Be Closed

If an FT causes a Stopped SA's current and payoff balances to become zero, the system closes the service agreement (i.e.,
the service agreement's status becomes Closed ).

###### A Closed Service Agreement May Be Reactivated

After a service agreement is closed (i.e., after it's stopped and paid-in-full), it's possible for some types of financial
transactions to be linked to the service agreement. These financial transactions could cause the current and/or payoff
balances to become non-zero. If this happens, the system reactivates the service agreement (i.e., the service agreement's
status becomes reactivated ).

When a service agreement becomes reactivated, it becomes eligible for review by the write-off process monitor (when
it next runs). The write-off process monitor will, in all likelihood, start a write-off process for the reactivated service
agreement.

Financial events that can be linked to a closed service agreement are:

- The cancellation of a bill segment

- The freezing of a payment segment

- The cancellation of a payment segment

- The freezing of an adjustment

- The cancellation of an adjustment

###### A Write-Off Process May Be Deactivated If The SA Is Closed

When a service agreement becomes Closed, it will be removed from any ongoing write-off processes. This removal could
cause the write-off process to become Inactive (if this is the last service agreement linked to the write-off process). The
inactivation of the write-off process, could, in turn, cause collection agency referrals associated with the write-off process to
be cancelled.

###### A Reactivated Service Agreement May Be Closed

After a service agreement has been reactivated (refer to the previous section for how this happens), a financial transaction
(or transactions) may be linked to it that will cause the current and payoff balance to return to zero. If this happens, the
system closes the service agreement (i.e., the service agreement's status becomes Closed ).

All types of financial transactions can be posted to a Reactivated service agreement.

###### A Collection Process May Be Canceled When A Credit FT Is Frozen

Periodically, the system determines if an account's debt violates your collection criteria. If so, a collection process is created
using the violated criteria's collection process template.

The Collection Process Monitor reviews an active collection process whenever one of its service agreements' debt is
reduced. Financial events that can cause service agreement debt to be reduced are:


-----

- The cancellation of a bill segment

- The freezing of a payment segment

- The freezing of an adjustment that credits a service agreement

At review time, the Collection Process Monitor removes any service agreement from a collection process when the service
agreement has no debt older than the arrears date on the collection process. When all service agreements are removed, the
collection process is cancelled.

**FASTPATH:**
Refer to The C&C Monitors for more information about debt monitoring.

###### A Severance Process May Be Canceled When A Credit FT Is Frozen

If the customer does not respond to a collection process's prodding, the system creates a severance process for each
delinquent service agreement associated with the collection process.

The system reviews an active severance process whenever its service agreements' debt is reduced. Financial events that can
cause service agreement debt to be reduced are:

- The cancellation of a bill segment

- The freezing of a payment segment

- The freezing of an adjustment that credits a service agreement

At review time, the system determines if the service agreement has no debt older than the arrears date on the severance
process. If so, the system looks at the severance process' severance process template:

- If the severance process template indicates that the process can be Usedto sever service, the system cancels all pending
severance events and deactivates the severance process. Note: the only severance processes that are not used to sever
service are those that request reconnection of a cut service.

- If the canceled process has field activities,

- If the field activities are not linked to a field order and are still in the pending status, the system cancels the field
activities.

- Otherwise, the system generates worklist entries to alert an operator that field activities have been dispatched. The
operator must determine how to handle these activities because they could already be scheduled for dispatch (or
completed!).

**NOTE:**
**Real time cancellation. Unlike collection processes, the system cancels severance processes real time (i.e., there is**
no equivalent of the collection process monitor for severance processes). Why are severance processes canceled real
time? Because a severance process may have events that create field activities to sever service. These events need to be
canceled the moment the FT is frozen, we can't wait until a background process runs. This means that if a customer pays
in person for a service agreement that is pending severance, the system will cancel the process and its field activities (if
any) the moment the payment is entered.

**FASTPATH:**
Refer to The C&C Monitors for more information about debt monitoring.


-----

###### One Or More Algorithms May Be Executed

If the FT is linked to a service agreement whose SA type has Freeze Algorithms, these algorithms will be executed when
the FT is frozen. Because you can code whatever you please in an algorithm, anything could happen. Examples of such
algorithm include:

- An algorithm that routes consumption to third party service providers when a bill is frozen (refer to STG SND CONS
for more information). This type of algorithm would be plugged in on SA types whose consumption can be interfaced to
other service providers.

- A bill message can be added to the account when the system detects that its deposit has been paid in full (refer to DEP
PIF MSG for more information). This type of algorithm would be plugged in on deposit SA types.

In addition, FT freeze algorithms can also be defined on an account's customer class. Because you can code whatever you
please in an algorithm, anything could happen. An example of such an algorithm is one that cancels match events when an
FT is cancelled (refer to CNCL FT MEVT for more information). This type of algorithm would be plugged in on customer
classes associated with open item customers.

###### The Big Picture of Balance Control

The balance control processes are used to check the financial integrity of your system. The contents of this section describe
how these processes work.

###### The Balance Control Background Processes

The following diagram illustrates the balance control background processes:

###### BCGNEW - Create A New Balance Control Group


-----

This process creates a Pending balance control group if one doesn't already exist. You may wonder why an entire process
is dedicated to such a trivial task. The reason is because the next process, BCASSIGN, is a multi-threaded (i.e., parallel)
process and we only need one Pending balance control group regardless of the number of threads used to assign balance
control ID's to financial transactions.

###### BCASSIGN - Assign New Financial Transactions A Balance Control Group

This multi-threaded (i.e., parallel) process assigns the Pending balance control group to new FTs whose freeze date/time is
before the create date/time of the balance control record.

###### BCGSNAP - Insert BC Members And Check Financial Integrity Of All FTs

This process performs the following two functions:

- It summarizes new financial transactions under the current Pending balance control group as follows:

- It creates a balance control member for every combination of Division, SA Type and FT Type referenced on the
financial transactions belonging to the balance control group.

- It updates each balance control member with the following information:

- The number of financial transactions (FTs)

- The sum of the total amounts on the FTs in this balance control group.

- The sum of the current amounts on the FTs in this balance control group.

- The sum of the total amounts from all FTs (in this and all other balance control groups).

- The sum of the current amounts from all FTs (in this and all other balance control groups).

- It sets the status of the balance control group to Complete.

- It checks the integrity of the financial transactions in each historical Balance Control Group. It does this by summarizing
EVERY financial transaction throughout time and determining if the sums are in sync with the values maintained on
the balance control members. If integrity problems are detected, a detailed error message is displayed on the run control
associated with the process.

If you opt to run the balance control processes on a nightly basis, you will find that the verification processing will take
longer every night (because there are more financial transactions over time). In order to deal with this issue, the BCGSNAP
process has a parameter that allows you to control which of the above functions is implemented (it's call VERIFY-ONLYSW). In order to speed nightly processing, run this process with the switch set to "G" (this causes new financial transactions
to be summarized under a new balance control). Then, once a week (or month), run this process with the switch set to
"Y" (this checks the financial integrity of all financial transactions in the system).

If you run the balance control processes less frequently, you can set the VERIFY-ONLY-SW to "N" (this causes both of the
above functions to execute).

###### Consider A Backup At This Point

We recommend you backup your database AFTER you run the above processes. Why? So that if a financial integrity
problem is spotted in the future, you can compare the current database against the backup to see what changed.

###### Balance Control Information Is Available Online


-----

Your internal auditors may be interested in the total number and amount of financial transactions that have been posted
since a given point in time. You can use the Balance Control page to see this information.

###### The GL Interface

The following diagram illustrates the GL Interface.

###### GLASSIGN - Assign GL Account Numbers To GL Details

The GLASSIGN process assigns GL account numbers to the GL details associated with financial transactions. GL account
numbers are assigned as follows:

- Every GL detail references a distribution code.

- Every distribution code references a GL assignment algorithm. The base package algorithm simply uses the default GL
account associated with the distribution code. However, you can construct your own algorithm(s) to assemble your GL
account numbers in your desired fashion. Refer to Setting Up Distribution Codes for more information about the GL
format algorithm.

- The GLASSIGN process simply calls each GL's details distribution code's GL assignment algorithm and updates the GL
detail with the result (i.e., the GL account number). This GL account number is then used by the GLDL process when it
creates the consolidated journal entry that's interfaced to the GL.

**NOTE:**
**If incorrect GL account numbers get assigned to GL details... If you do not plug in the correct algorithm or your**
algorithm is wrong, you can correct the GL account numbers that are assigned to the GL details. How? Write a simple
program that resets the GL account numbers on the erroneous GL details. Then run GLASSIGN. GLASSIGN will reexecute the distribution code GL assignment algorithm and refresh the account number accordingly.


-----

###### GLS - Prepare FTs for Download

The GLS process creates FT download staging records for all FTs that are ready to be posted to the GL (the FT download
staging records are stored on the FT/Process table). Each FT download staging record is marked with a batch control ID and
run number.

- The batch control ID is the process responsible for creating the flat file that contains the consolidated journal entry that is
interfaced to your general ledger. The batch control ID is defined on Installation Options - Financial. The system comes
with a single GL download program (GLDL - Create General Ledger Download Flat File). The GL account numbers
are provided by the GL account algorithms that are specified on the distribution codes. Refer to Setting Up Distribution
Codes for more information about the GL account algorithm.

- The run number is the batch control ID's current run number.

This process also changes the status of the FT to distributed. You may not change the FT's GL details after this time.

###### GLDL - Create General Ledger Download Flat File

The GLDL process creates the flat file that contains the consolidated journal entry that is interfaced to your general ledger.
One header and multiple detail records are created as described below. At the conclusion of the batch process, a validation
is performed to compare debits against credits. If they are not equal, the process terminates with an error.

###### Header Record Layout

Field Name Format Source/Value/Description

REC_TYPE A1 1 ( 1 is used for header records )

BATCH_CD A8 The code for the batch process that created

the file. (This value will always be 'GLDL'.)

BATCH_NBR N10 The batch process will be run many times.

This field indicates which of those runs

produced a particular output file. This may

be thought of as an instance identifier for the

batch process.

BATCH_RERUN_NBR N10 Any given instance of the GLDL batch

process may be re-run at any time. If this

instance has been re-run, this field will be

populated with a number indicating how often.

EXTRACT_DTTM A26 The date and time of the run that created a

particular output file.

DETAIL_REC_CNT N12 The number of details records

DETAIL_REC_TOTAL_DR N13.2 This is the sum of FINANCIAL_AMOUNTs

from all detail records that were greater than

zero (debits).


-----

DETAIL_REC_TOTAL_CR N13.2 This is the sum of FINANCIAL_AMOUNTs

from all detail records that were less than zero

(credits).

###### Detail Record Layout for GLDL

**NOTE:**
A record is created for each unique occurrence of REC_TYPE, GL_DIVISION, CURRENCY_CD, GL_ACCOUNT
and ACCT_PERIOD. If a given GL account has debit and credit FINANCIAL_AMOUNTs, two records will be created

  - one shows the debit amount, the other shows the credit amount.

Field Name Format Source/Value/Description

REC_TYPE A1 2 ( 2 is used for detail records )

GL_DIVISION A5 This is the GL Division from the CI_FT record.

It determines a) which Accounting Calendar

will be used to calculate the Accounting

Period (below) and b) the currency of the FT.

CURRENCY_CD A3 The currency in which the Amount is

denominated.

GL_ACCOUNT A254 Contains the GL account number as supplied

by the distribution code's GL account

algorithm.

ACCT_PERIOD A6 An accounting period in the format YYYYPP

where YYYY is the fiscal year and PP is the

accounting period. This is derived from the GL

detail's FT's accounting date and GL division.

FINANCIAL_AMOUNT N13.2 This is the debit or credit amount. Debits are

represented by positive numbers; credits are

represented by negative numbers. If a given

GL account has debit and credit entries, two

records will be created - one shows the debit

amount, the other shows the credit amount.

STAT_CODE A8 This is the GL distribution code's statistic code

(if any)

STAT_AMOUNT N13.6 This is the statistical amount from the GL

detail lines

**NOTE:**
The GLASSIGN process updates an FT's GL details with the appropriate GL account number.

##### Financial Transaction


-----

Payment segments, adjustments and bill segment have a corresponding financial transaction. The financial transaction is
created by the system when any of the source transactions is created. It contains the financial effects of its corresponding
adjustment / bill segment / payment segment.

**FASTPATH:**
**For background information, refer to The Big Picture Of Financial Transactions.**

The topics in this section describe the financial transaction page.

###### Financial Transaction - Main

Use Menu > Financial > Financial Transaction to update and maintain financial transaction information.

**NOTE:**
**Navigating from source transactions. On the bill, payment, and adjustment maintenance pages, you can click the**
financial transaction go to button to transfer to this page.

**Description of Page**

Most of the attributes on this page are display-only. The following points describe the conditions under which certain fields
may be modified:

- **Accounting Date may be modified until the financial transaction (FT) is interfaced to the GL (i.e., until the GL**
**Distribution Status is Distributed ).**

- **New Charge may be modified until the FT is swept onto a bill (when the next bill is completed for the FT's account). If**
**New Charge is modifiable and turned off, Arrears Date must be specified.**

- **Show on Bill and Correction can be modified until the FT is frozen.**

The remainder of this section defines each of the fields on the page.

**FT Type is the type of financial transaction. Values are: Adjustment, Adjustment Cancellation, Bill Segment, Bill Segment**
Cancellation, Pay Segment, and Pay Segment Cancellation. Click the go to button to view the originating transaction on the
adjustment, bill, or payment page.

**FT ID is the system-assigned, unique identifier of the financial transaction.**

**SA ID is the system-assigned, unique identifier of the service agreement to which the financial transaction is linked.**

**Bill ID is the system-assigned, unique identifier of the bill to which the financial transaction is linked. This field is only**
populated after the FT is swept onto a bill (and this happens when the next bill is completed for the FT's account).

**Sibling ID is the system-assigned, unique identifier of the source transaction associated with the FT.**

- If this FT is associated with a bill segment, Sibling ID contains the unique identifier of the bill segment.

- If this FT is associated with a payment segment, Sibling ID contains the unique identifier of the payment segment.

- If this FT is associated with an adjustment, Sibling ID contains the unique identifier of the adjustment.

**Parent ID contains the following:**

- If this FT is associated with a bill segment, Parent ID contains the unique identifier of the bill with which the bill
segment is associated.

- If this FT is associated with a payment segment, Parent ID contains the unique identifier of the payment with which the
payment segment is associated.

- If this FT is associated with an adjustment, Parent ID contains the adjustment type.

**Create Date/Time are the date and time the FT was created.**


-----

**Accounting Date is the accounting date that will be used by the general ledger to define the accounting period(s) into which**
the FT will be booked.

**CIS Division is the CIS division associated with the FT. This comes from the CIS division linked to the FT's service**
agreement's SA type.

**GL Division is the GL division associated with the FT. This comes from the GL division linked to the FT's service**
agreement's SA type.

**Show on Bill indicates if the FT will be shown on the customer's bill. You should only turn this off for erroneous FTs**
that should not be shown to the customer. For example, if you cancel / rebill a bill segment and you want to suppress the
resultant FTs on the printed bill, turn this switch off.

**New Charge indicates if the FT's charge only starts aging when the FT is swept onto the next bill produced for the account.**
If you want to manually enter an Arrears Date you must turn this switch off. The system leaves this switch set when
assigning an arrears date during the bill completion process. This is done so the system knows which FTs were assigned an
arrears date during bill completion. If a completed bill is reopened, the arrears date is reassigned when the bill is completed.

**Not In Arrears indicates if the FT's financial impact has been canceled and therefore should not be considered for arrears**
purposes. This switch is turned on by the system when a FT's source transaction in canceled (both the original FT and the
cancellation FT are marked as Not In Arrears).

**Match Event ID is the system-assigned, unique identifier of the match event to which the financial transaction is linked.**
This field is only enabled for Open Item Accounts. Be aware that changing a financial transaction's match event can result
in the balancing / unbalancing of the prior and newly referenced match events.

**Arrears Date is the date the FT starts aging. This field is typically blank until the FT is swept onto the account's bill. If you**
want to start aging an FT on an historical date (for whatever reason), enter the appropriate Arrears Date. (Note - you must
uncheck the "New Charge" box first in order to do this.) If the arrears date is assigned manually it is not updated during bill
completion nor is it adjusted when a bill is reopened and completed again.

**Correction causes the FT to be summarized in the correction area of the bill-at-a-glance. This is set by the system**
automatically when a bill segment is cancelled / rebilled after its parent bill is completed (i.e., sent to the customer).

**Redundant indicates if the FT's financial impact is considered irrelevant. This only happens after an FT has reached an age**
that is no longer relevant for aging purposes (e.g., when the FT is older than 120 days - or whatever age has been set as the
Oldest Bucket Age on the Installation Options) and when its balance is exactly equal to zero with respect to other redundant
FTs of the service agreement.

**Transferred Out indicates if the FT has been transferred to a service provider. This could only happen if the FT is**
associated with a SA that is associated with a "they bill for us" service provider. Refer to They Bill For Us for more
information.

The Frozen switch is turned on when the FT has been frozen (i.e., posted to the service agreement's payoff and/or current
balances). If this switch is on, both Freeze Date/Time and Frozen By are populated.

**Current Amount contains the FT's impact on the service agreement's current amount.**

**Payoff Amount contains the FT's impact on the service agreement's payoff amount.**

**FASTPATH:**
For more information, refer to Current Balance versus Payoff Balance.

**Currency Code is the currency code associated with the FT's account.**

**GL Distribution Status defines the status of the FT in respect of its interface to the general ledger. When an FT is first**
created, its status is Pending . When an FT is frozen, this value is set to Generated. If you modify the GL details, the status
becomes Modified. After it has been marked for interface to the general ledger by the GLS process, the status becomes
Distributed.


-----

**GL Extract Dates display the Scheduled date that the GL details will be marked for interface to the general ledger. Note**
that this date is typically only set to a future date for FTs associated with automatic payments. Actual displays the date that
the GL details were actually posted to the general ledger.

The grid at the bottom shows the FT's debits and credits (i.e., the detail journal lines). Debits are shown as positive amounts,
credits are negative amounts. The following points describe rules governing if and how the information in the grid can be
modified:

- The FT GL details may not be modified if the FT is Pending or Distributed.

- All Amounts must sum to zero.

- Multiple FT GL details may be set to affect the Total Amount (although they are normally generated with one GL
checked to affect total amount).

- All FT GL's checked to affect Total Amount must sum to the Payoff Amount of the FT.

The following information is displayed:

- **Sequence number is the system-assigned, unique identifier of the journal line.**

- **Total Amount defines if the journal line contains the total of the other journal lines. For example, on a bill segment for**
utility service, this would be turned on for the receivable account because its amount equals the sum of the other payable
and revenue GL accounts.

- **Distribution Code is the CIS distribution code from which the GL account constituents are derived.**

- If the GL Account has been populated, the GL account number is displayed.

**FASTPATH:**
Refer to GLASSIGN - Assign GL Account Numbers To GL Details for more information about how the GL account is
populated.

- **Amount defines the journal line's amount.**

- **Statistic Amount defines the statistical amount that will be posted to the GL. This value is only populated on**
distribution lines created for calculation rules designated as affecting GL statistical quantity.

- **Characteristic Type and Characteristic Value describe the characteristic value that was used when the line's amount**
was calculated. This information is only displayed if the journal line was derived from bill calculation lines that were
calculated using a bill factor (because only bill factor's use characteristic values). Refer to An Illustration Of A Bill
Factor And Its Characteristics for more information.

**NOTE:**
**Tax reporting. A journal line's characteristic value is NOT interfaced to the GL. We have included this attribute on the**
journal line so that tax reporting can be performed from this system (tax reporting typically necessitates showing each
taxing authority - the characteristic value - that participated in a given tax payable GL account).

associated with this distribution code is displayed.

###### Financial Transaction - FT Process

Use Menu > Financial > Financial Transaction and navigate to the FT Process page to view those ancillary processes
that may be triggered as a result of this financial transaction.

**NOTE:**


-----

**Algorithms cause financial transactions to be linked to batch processes. Financial transactions get associated with**
a given process / batch number when certain algorithms are executed. For example, when a bill segment is frozen, the
system executes the freeze algorithms associated with the bill segment's service agreement's SA type. One of these
algorithms may check if there are service providers who are interested in the bill segment's consumption, and if so,
schedule the consumption to be downloaded by linking the bill segment's financial transaction to the service provider's
consumption download process.

**Description of Page**

This page shows the Batch Processes associated with a given Financial Transaction. Information on this page may not be
modified. This information appears purely for audit purposes.

##### Account Financial History

This portal shows how an account's current and payoff balance have changed over time. You can access the portal from
**Menu > Financial Query > Account Financial History.**

Refer the portal’s embedded help for more details.

**FASTPATH:**
**For information about current and payoff balance, refer to Current Amount versus Payoff Amount.**

##### Account Bill / Payment History

This portal shows an account's bills and payments. You can access the portal from Menu > Financial Query > Account
**Bill / Payment History .**

For balance-forward accounts, bill rows contain the balance presented on the respective bill, and payment rows contain the
amount of the respective payment. However, for open-item accounts, this query behaves differently. Refer to the portal’s
embedded help for more details.

**NOTE:**
**Credit Notes or Correction Notes. The Bill Correction option on the Installation record controls whether Credit Notes**
or Correction Notes are allowed. The default transaction type filter displayed is for Credit Note. If your implementation
uses Correction Notes, you'll need to change the transaction type filter to reflect this. This is done by overriding the label
for lookup value CRNT on the customizable lookup field TXN_FLTR_TYPE_FLG .

##### SA Financial History

This portal shows how a service agreement’s current and payoff balance have changed over time. You can access the portal
from Menu > Financial Query > SA Financial History .

Refer to the portal’s embedded help for more details.

**FASTPATH:**
**For information about current and payoff balance, refer to Current Amount versus Payoff Amount.**

##### SA Non-Accrual Accounting Balance

**NOTE:**
**Only relevant if you practice non-accrual accounting. This transaction is only relevant if you practice non-accrual**
accounting (e.g., you only pay the taxing authorities when the customer pays you, you defer revenue recognition till a
later date, or a combination of the two). Refer to Payables Cash Accounting and Deferred Accrual Accounting for more
information about non-accrual accounting.

This page displays a grid that shows a service agreement's non-accrual accounting balance for each non-accrual holding
distribution code that's been booked to. Use Menu > Financial Query > SA Non-Accrual Accounting Balance to open
this page.

**Description of Page**

The following columns are displayed in the grid:

**Holding Distribution Code This is a general ledger distribution code used as the holding account for non-accrual**
accounting. Each holding account that's been used by this service agreement will appear here.

**Payable Distribution Code This is the general ledger distribution code to which the payable is (or will be) transferred**
when the cash event occurs or when the designated revenue recognition date elapses. The system supports revenue
recognition on the bill due date.

**FASTPATH:**
**For more information on how the distribution codes are set up, refer to Setting Up Distribution Codes.**

**Payoff Balance This column shows the service agreement's balance for each non-accrual holding account. If this amount is**
non-zero, it indicates that for this service agreement we are still holding some payables back until payment is received by
the customer, at which time some or all of this amount will be transferred to the payable distribution code.

**Accounting Method This column shows which accounting method is used for the distribution.**

**Accounting Priority This column shows the priority level associated with the distribution code. If more than one**
distribution code is to receive a payable then the priority level, along with debt age, will determine the order in which the
transfers are made.

**FASTPATH:**
**For information about non-accrual accounting, refer to Payables Cash Accounting and Deferred Accrual Accounting.**

##### Balance Control

This page is used to summarize the financial transactions that belong to a particular balance control group.

**FASTPATH:**
Refer to The Big Picture of Balance Controlfor more information.

**NOTE:**


-----

**Balance Control information is current only as of the Create Date/Time listed. The information displayed on the**
page is captured when the balance control background process is run. Any financial activity subsequent to the create
date and time will not be shown.

Use Menu > Financial Query > Balance Control to open this page.

**Description of Page**

This page displays summarized financial information for a particular balance control group. It also details financial
information for all SA Types that belong to the group.

The following fields are displayed on the page:

**Group ID This is a sequential value that uniquely identifies a particular balance control run. The Group ID is assigned and**
incremented automatically every time the Balance Control background process is run.

**Status This is the status of the balance control record: Pending, and Complete . The status of the balance control record**
will only be pending while the balance control background process is being executed. Balance control information is only
reliable if the status is complete.

**Create Date/Time This is the date and time that the balance control record was created. Financial information displayed on**
this page will only contain information for financial transactions frozen before this date and time.

**Current Amount This is the sum of the current amounts of all FTs that belong to the balance control group.**

**Payoff Amount This is the sum of the payoff amounts of all FTs that belong to the balance control group.**

**Current Balance This is the sum of the current amounts of all FTs that belong to this balance control group plus all earlier**
balance control groups. Therefore this is the instantaneous current balance of the entire CIS as of the create date and time.

**Payoff Balance This is the sum of the payoff amounts of all FTs that belong to this balance control group plus all earlier**
balance control groups. Therefore this is the instantaneous payoff balance of the entire CIS as of the create date and time.

The number of FT information details the number of bill segments, pay segments, adjustments and their cancellations that
belong to the balance control group.

**Adjustment The total number of adjustments that belong to this balance control group.**

**Adjustment Cancellation The total number of adjustment cancellations that belong to this balance control group.**

**Bill Segment The total number of bill segments that belong to this balance control group.**

**Bill Segment Cancellation The total number of bill cancellations that belong to this balance control group.**

**Pay Segment The total number of pay segments that belong to this balance control group.**

**Pay Segment Cancellation The total number of pay cancellations that belong to this balance control group.**

The SA Type scroll summarizes the FTs that belong to a particular SA Type within the balance control group - otherwise all
fields are defined as above. You can scroll through all SA Types that belong to the balance control group.

**SA Type The SA Type being summarized.**

##### Match Event

**WARNING:**
Match Events are only used if you practice Open Item Accounting.

Match events are used to match debit and credit financial transactions together. When financial transactions are linked to a
balanced match event, they no longer affect the customer's arrears.

You can use the match event page to do the following:


-----

- Add, change, delete, and cancel match events.

- Add and remove financial transactions from / to a match event.

- Designate financial transactions as being "in dispute" (disputed financial transactions do not affect aged debt until they
are resolved).

- View all unmatched financial transactions linked to an account.

**FASTPATH:**
Refer to Match Events for a full description of the lifecycle of a match event and a description of how the system
automatically creates match events.

###### Match Event - Main

A typical match event matches a bill's financial transactions with a payment's financial transactions. The Main page allows
you to define the bill(s) and payment(s) whose financial transactions are matched together. Use Menu > Financial >
**Match Event > Search to open this page.**

**NOTE:**
**Debit must equal credits. Before a match event impacts a customer's arrearage, its debits and credits must net to zero**
for every service agreement referenced on the match event. Until that time, the financial transactions on a match event
continue to affect arrearage. The only exception is the case of disputes.

**You can match any debit and credit. While the above describes the matching of bills and payments, it's important to**
remember that a match event matches any type of debit with any type of credit. This means that a match event could
match a bill with a credit or correction note, or a payment with a payment cancellation.

**You can match any number of payments under a match event. While most match events deal with a single bill and a**
single payment, there's no limitation to the number of payments on a match event. The only restriction is that the debits
and credits must net to zero for all service agreements.

**It is better not to mix multiple bills on a single match event. For purposes of bill balance information, it is strongly**
recommended that you compose your match events with financial transactions limited to a single bill. If you mix
financial transactions from multiple bills on a single match event you will not be able to determine the unpaid balance of
a partially paid bill.

**You can match specific financial transactions. While most match events deal with every financial transaction on a**
bill and payment, a match event can deal with individual financial transactions. For example, a match event could match
a bill segment with a combination of a payment segment and a write-off adjustment. If you need to add or remove a
specific financial transaction (i.e., a bill segment, payment segment, or adjustment), navigate to the FT Details tab.
Perhaps a better way to differentiate between this page and the FT Details tab is to consider the example of a bill with
100 bill segments. When you link this bill to a match event, you are actually linking its 100 financial transactions. If you
wanted to add only a subset of this bill's financial transactions to the match event, you'd use the FT Details tab.

**FASTPATH:**
Refer to How To for instructions describing how to perform common match event maintenance functions.

**Description of Page**

This page is used to maintain the financial transactions (FTs) that are linked to a match event. The remainder of this section
defines each of the fields on the page.


-----

**Match Event Info and Match Event ID only appear after the match event exists on the database. The ID is a system**
assigned random number that stays with the match event for life. Match Event Info is a concatenation of important details
about the match event and its account.

The next section contains the sum of the Debit and Credit financial transactions linked to the match event. If the debits and
credits do not sum to zero, the Difference is also shown.

**Account ID defines the account whose financial transactions are matched under this match event. This field is gray after the**
match event is added to the database.

**Match Event Status defines the state of the match event.**

- Match events are initially created in the open state. Please note that you may delete an open match event.

- The system automatically changes an open event's status to balanced when the sum of the Debit(s) equals the sum of the
**Credit(s)for each service agreement on the match event. It's worth stressing that a match event may contain financial**
transactions from many service agreements and each service agreement's financial transactions must sum to zero before
the match event can become balanced.

- You may re open a balanced event (by adding / removing items so that the match event becomes unbalanced).

- You can cancel a balanced or open match event by changing the Match Event Status to cancelled. You must also define
a Cancel Reason if you cancel a match event. Refer to How Are Match Events Cancelled? for more information about
cancellation.

Turn on Dispute if this match event exists to designate certain financial transactions as disputed. In addition,

- Describe the reason for the dispute in Remarks.

- Link the disputed financial transactions to the match event by selecting the bill(s) below. If only a subset of a bill is
disputed:

- Click on the respective hyperlink in the Unmatched Debits column grid (this will transfer you to the next tab with these
financial transactions displayed).

- Select the bill segments that you want to designate as disputed.

- Press the Link / Unlink button to link the selected bill segments to the match event.

**NOTE:**
**Disputing items on a balanced event. The Dispute switch will be protected when the match event is Balanced or**
Cancelled. If the items on a balanced event are being disputed, you must add / remove items so that the match event
becomes Open before you can turn on the Dispute switch.

The remainder of the page is dynamic depending on the Match Event Status:

- If the status is Balanced or Open, a grid appears containing a summary of the bills, payments, credit or correction notes,
and payment cancellations that contribute financial transactions to the match event (note, we refer to these collectively as
"contributing objects" in the following discussion). The following columns appear in this grid:

- **Transaction Type defines whether the contributing object is a Bill, Payment, Payment Cancellation, or Credit or**
Correction Note. In the rare situation when unbilled financial transactions are linked to the match event, a transaction
type of Not Billed Yet appears. If the contributing object is a bill its bill id is also displayed. If sequential bill
functionality is enabled, the bill's sequential id is displayed instead.

- **Matched Activity Information contains summary information about the contributing object. This column is blank if the**
transaction type is Not Billed Yet.

- The remaining columns contain the count and amount of each contributing object's financial transactions categorized as
follows (note, you can drill down on the count or amount to see the specific financial transactions (FT's) on the next tab).

- **Matched Debits summarizes the contributing object's debit FT's that are linked to this match event. A checkbox appears**
if the count is greater than zero. If you select the checkbox and press the Link / Unlink button, these debits will be
removed from the match event.


-----

- **Matched Credits summarizes the contributing object's credit FT's that are linked to this match event. A checkbox**
appears if the count is greater than zero. If you select the checkbox and press the Link / Unlink button, these credits will
be removed from the match event.

- **Other Debits summarizes the contributing object's debit FT's that are NOT linked to this match event.**

- **Other Credits summarizes the contributing object's credit FT's that are NOT linked to this match event.**

**NOTE:**
**Adding more financial transactions to a balanced match event. When a match event is Balanced, the grid showing**
unmatched FT's is suppressed (and therefore you can't add additional FT's to the match event). To expose this grid,
simply change the status of the match event to Open.

- If the status is Open, a second grid appears containing a summary of the bills, payments, credit notes, correction
notes and payment cancellations with at least one unmatched financial transaction (we refer to these collectively as
"unmatched objects" in the following discussion). The following columns appear in this grid:

- **Transaction Type defines whether the unmatched object is a Bill, Payment, Payment Cancellation, Credit, or Correction**
Note. A transaction type of Not Billed Yet is used for unbilled financial transactions (e.g., adjustments generated
between bills). If the unmatched object is a bill its bill id is also displayed. If sequential bill functionality is enabled, the
bill's sequential id is displayed instead.

- **Unmatched Activity Information contains summary information about the unmatched object. This column is blank if**
the transaction type is Not Billed Yet.

- The remaining columns contain the count and amount of each unmatched object's financial transactions categorized as
follows (note, you can drill down on the count or amount to see the specific financial transactions (FT's) on the next tab).

- **Unmatched Debits summarizes the unmatched object's debit FT's that are not linked to any match event. A checkbox**
appears if the count is greater than zero. If you select the checkbox and press the Link / Unlink button, these debits will
be added to the match event.

- **Unmatched Credits summarizes the unmatched object's credit FT's that are not linked to any match event. A checkbox**
appears if the count is greater than zero. If you select the checkbox and press the Link / Unlink button, these credits will
be added to the match event.

- **Matched Debits summarizes the unmatched object's debit FT's that are linked to any match event.**

- **Matched Credits summarizes the unmatched object's credit FT's that are linked to any match event.**

**NOTE:**
**Credit Notes or Correction Notes. The Bill Correction option on the Installation record controls whether Credit Notes**
or Correction Notes are allowed. The default Transaction Type displayed is for Credit Note. If your implementation uses
Correction Notes, you'll need to change the transaction type filter to reflect this. This is done by overriding the label for
lookup value CRNT on the customizable lookup field TXN_FLTR_TYPE_FLG.

The last section contains the running total of the Debit and Credit financial transactions that have been selected / unselected
in the above grids. If debits and credits do not sum to zero, the Difference is also shown. These values differ from the
values on the top of the page as they are updated when a user selects / unselects an object (whereas the values at the top of
the page are only updated when the database is changed).

The Link / Unlink button becomes enabled when you select an object in the grids. When you press this button, the financial
transactions related to the object are added to / removed from the match event.

###### Match Event - FT Details


-----

On the Main tab, you can add and remove bills, payments, credit notes, correction notes and payment cancellations to /
from a match event. When you do this, you are actually adding and removing all of the financial transactions linked to these
objects. For example, when you link a bill with 100 bill segments to a match event, you are actually linking its 100 financial
transactions.

You need only use the FT Details tab when you need to add or remove specific financial transactions. For example, you
would use the FT Details tab if you need to remove 1 of a bill's 100 financial transactions from a match event.

Use Menu > Financial > Match Event > Search and navigate to the FT Details page (note, you can also open this page
using many of the hyperlinks on the Main and SA Subtotals tabs).

###### How To Perform Common Match Event Functions

 How To Find The Match Event Associated With A Financial Transaction

If you need to find the match event on which a financial transaction (FT) was matched, display the FT in question on
Financial Transaction - Main and then use the "go to" button adjacent to the Match Event to drill to the match event.

**NOTE:**
The easiest way to display a financial transaction is to find its corresponding bill, payment or adjustment and then drill
down on the desired transaction.

###### How To Dispute An Item

Refer to Disputing Items for background information about disputes.

If a customer wants to dispute an item:

- Turn the match event's dispute switch on.

- Link the disputed financial transaction to the match event.

- Describe in the match event's comments the reason for the dispute.

###### How To Match A Small Mismatch

Assume the following scenario arises:

- A bill is produced for $2000

- The customer pays $1993

- An unbalanced match event will result because the customer didn't pay exactly what is owed

If you want to match this payment to the bill (and leave $7 for the next bill), do the following:

- Create a transfer adjustment of $7 where the transfer from / to service agreement is the same. This results in a debit
financial transaction (FT) of $7 and a credit FT of $7.

- Create a match event (or update the unbalanced match event) where the matched FTs are:

- The $1993 payment

- The credit side of the transfer adjustment ($7)


-----

- And the $2000 bill

- Then, if the customer pays their next bill in full, the $7 debit (associated with the transfer adjustment) will be swept onto
it.

**NOTE:**
**Automating small mismatches. The algorithm responsible for matching a payment to a specific bill can have a**
tolerance amount defined on it. If the payment is within the tolerance limit, this algorithm will do the above for you. In
other words, you don't have to manually do the above if you populate the tolerance limit appropriately on this algorithm.
Refer to DSOV BILL-ID for more information about this algorithm.

#### Deposits

In this section, we describe how to manage your deposits.

##### The Big Picture Of Deposits

The topics in this section provide background information about a variety of deposit issues.

**FASTPATH:**
We strongly recommend familiarizing yourself with the topics described in The Financial Big Picture to fully appreciate
how deposits fit into the system's financial architecture.

###### Cash Deposits

Before you can bill a customer for a deposit, there must be a deposit service agreement (SA). Deposit SAs will be created
by a CSR using Start/Stop Service (the same page used to create all other types of service agreements).

Deposit SAs behave just like any other service agreement in that:

- A deposit SA must reference an SA type. Refer to Service Agreement Type Controls Everything for information about
how SA type controls a service agreement's behavior.

- Bill segments will be produced to bill the customer for a deposit. Note, bill segments associated with deposit SAs will
appear on the same bill as other bill segments related to its account (i.e., a bill could contain a combination of utility,
deposit, and non-utility bill segments).

- When a customer makes a payment, it will be distributed amongst its account's SAs based on each SA's payment
distribution priority. This means a single payment could relieve receivable accounts (associated with utility service
agreements) and increase a payable account (associated with the deposit service agreement). Refer to Distributing A
Payment Amongst An Account's Service Agreements for more information.

- You can use a transfer adjustment to relieve debt on some other type of service agreement (by transferring all or part of
the deposit's credit balance to another service agreement).

- You can use an A/P adjustment to cause a check to be created if you need to manually refund a deposit.

- When you no longer require the deposit, a CSR will stop the deposit SA using Start/Stop Service (the same page used to
stop all other types of service agreements). Refer to Refunding Deposits for information about how the refund actually
takes place.


-----

**FASTPATH:**
Refer to Deposit Class Controls Everythingfor information about deposit interest, the recommended deposit amount
algorithm, and how deposits are refunded.

**NOTE:**
**An account can have many deposits. You can view all deposits (both cash and non-cash) linked to an account on**
Account - Deposits.

###### Refunding Deposits

To refund a deposit, you simply need to change the deposit SA's state to pending stop. The system does everything else (i.e.,
calculates interest and refunds the deposit to the customer).

There are three ways in which a deposit SA's state can become pending stop:

- The Deposit Refund background process (DEPRFND) make a deposit service agreement pending stop when it detects
that the customer meets the automatic refund criteria. Refer to Defines The Conditions That Cause The System To
Automatically Refund A Deposit for a description of how to define the conditions that control automatic refund.

- An operator, at their discretion, may refund a deposit by stopping the deposit SA using Start/Stop Service (the same page
used to stop all other types of service agreements). This page simply changes the deposit SA's state to pending stop.

- The system changes the state of a deposit service agreement to pending stop when it recognizes that all other SAs of its
deposit class have also been stopped. This may be necessary, for example, when a customer's utility service agreements
have been severed for non-payment. Refer to Deposit Seizures When Other SAs Are Stopped for more information.

The system changes the state of a pending stop SA to stopped when the process responsible for Finalizing Pending Stops
next runs.

When a deposit SA becomes stopped, the system calculates interest through the stop date. Refer to Controls Interest
Calculation for a description of how interest is calculated.

**NOTE:**
If you can't wait for this process to run, simply display the deposit SA on Service Agreement - Main Information and
press the stop button.

When the stopped deposit SA is final billed, the system produces a final bill segment that shows the deposit amount being
returned to the customer. When the bill segment's bill is completed, the deposit is refunded to the customer as per the
deposit refund algorithm on the deposit's deposit class. Refer to Controls How Deposits Are Refunded To A Customer for a
description of how a deposit is refunded.

**WARNING:**
None of the base package deposit refund algorithms create an A/P adjustment when the deposit service agreement is
final billed. Rather, they depend on the write-off preprocessing to actually refund the deposit to the customer.

###### Partial Refunds

You can perform a partial refund by creating an adjustment for the deposit SA. If you want to refund the adjustment with a
check, this adjustment should be an A/P adjustment (i.e., one that is interfaced to A/P). If you want to refund the adjustment
by offsetting some other service agreement's debt, create a transfer adjustment (transferring from the deposit SA to the SA
to be relieved).


-----

After creating the adjustment, you'll find that the deposit SA has a positive current amount due (because you debited the
deposit SA to refund the credit amount). You should create another adjustment to return the current amount of the deposit to
zero. It's important to use an adjustment type that only affects current amount when you do this.

After getting the deposit's current amount back to an expected amount, you will have to change the deposit SA's Total
Amount To Bill to reflect the amount of deposit you want to hold for the customer. So, for example, if you were holding a
$500 deposit and you want to refund $100, you should change the deposit SA's Total Amount To Bill to be $400.

###### Total Amount To Bill

Most deposit service agreements contain a "Total Amount To Bill" field. The label for this field is defined on the SA type
(on the Billing tab). For deposit SAs, it should be labeled something liked Cash Deposit Amount. This field should reflect
the deposit amount you WANT to hold on this service agreement. Please be aware of the following in respect of this field:

- If the payoff balance (i.e., the current deposit held) is less than the Total Amount To Bill, the system will generate a bill
segment to charge the customer for the deposit.

- If the deposit service agreement uses a recurring charge (i.e., you bill the total amount in installments), the amount billed
to the customer will not exceed the recurring charge amount (unless the bill segment is prorated).

- If the deposit service agreement does not use a recurring charge, the amount billed will equal the difference between
Total Amount To Bill and the service agreement's payoff balance.

- If you need to bill an incremental deposit on an existing deposit service agreement, simply change the deposit service
agreement's Total Amount To Bill.

- If the payoff balance (i.e., the current deposit held) is greater than the Total Amount To Bill, the system will NOT refund
the excess deposit.

**NOTE:**
**SA Type and Total Amount to Bill. A deposit service agreement's SA type controls if the deposit service agreement**
uses Total Amount to Bill. Typically, the only SA types that indicate this field can be used are loan and deposit service
agreements.

###### Current Balance versus Payoff Balance

**WARNING:**
If you do not understand the difference between payoff balance and current balance, refer to Current Amount versus
Payoff Amount.

The current balance on a deposit SA contains the amount of the deposit that has been billed, but not paid. The payoff
balance on a deposit SA contains the amount of deposit being held. The payoff balance is a negative number because your
company owes this money to the customer.

The financial ramifications of a deposit SA are predictable (if you're an accountant). The following table outlines the
different financial events and their impact on the general ledger, arrearage history, and the amounts due (both current and
payoff).

**NOTE:**


-----

It's important to be aware that everything that is shown in this table is controlled by how you set up the deposit SA type's
bill segment type, payment segment type, and adjustment types. Refer to Service Agreement Type Controls Everything
for how to do this.

The following points describe the events in the above table:

- **Deposit billed. In this example, the customer is billed for $100 deposit.**

- The customer really thinks they owe the billed amount, $100. Therefore, current amount is affected. However, if the
customer was to cash out, they wouldn't owe your organization anything, therefore payoff amount is not affected.

- Notice that the GL is not affected when the deposit is billed. This is because most organizations do not show a receivable
for billed deposits (as it's not a true receivable).

- Because current amount changed by $100, arrearage history is affected accordingly.

- **Payment received. With any luck, the client will pay the $100 that was billed.**

- The payment has a normal affect on the GL (debit cash, credit deposit payable). The deposit payable GL account is
defined as the deposit SA type's Distribution Code.

- The amount the customer thinks they owe decreases by $100, therefore current amount is affected by the payment
amount. And, if the customer was to cash out, your organization would owe the customer $100, therefore payoff amount
is affected by the payment amount.

- Because current amount changed by $100, arrearage history is affected accordingly.

- **Interest calculated. In this example, the system calculates interest of $5.**

- The interest is posted to the GL (the interest expense distribution code is defined on the respective adjustment type).

- The interest amount didn't affect how much the customer thinks is due them. Therefore current amount is unaffected.
However, if the customer was to cash out, your organization would owe them $100 + $5 (the interest) therefore payoff
amount is affected by $5.

- Because current amount is not changed, arrearage history is not affected.

###### Multiple Deposits Linked To A Single Account

The system has been designed to allow your customers to have multiple deposits. This is necessary when a deposit is
restricted to a specific type of debt. For example, if separate deposits are held for regulated and unregulated debt (and
a customer could hold a combination of regulated and unregulated debt), you'd need one deposit for regulated debt and
another for unregulated debt.


-----

**NOTE:**
**Deposit class. A deposit's deposit class controls the service agreements that are covered by a given deposit. A deposit's**
deposit class is defined on its SA type. Refer to Designing Your Deposit Classes for more information.

It's important to be aware that if your company has multiple classes of deposits, the system will recommend and refund
deposits for each individual deposit class. For example, if you have both regulated and unregulated deposit classes, the
system will recommend separate deposits for each class. And at refund time, a deposit will be distributed to only those
service agreements associated with its deposit class (i.e., a regulated deposit will not be used to satisfy unregulated debt).

###### Deposits and Credit & Collections

The account debt monitor monitors deposit service agreements just as it monitors every other service agreement for overdue
debt. If the amount of debt on the deposit SA violates your collection criteria, a collection process will start.

**FASTPATH:**
Refer to The Lifecycle Of A Collection Process And Its Eventsfor more information.

It's important to be aware that deposit debt can be treated differently from other types of debt linked to an account by
creating a specific debt class for the deposit SA type.

**FASTPATH:**
Refer to Designing Your Collection Procedures for more information about how to have different collection criteria for
different debt classes.

The type of severance process associated with a deposit SA is probably rather simple - you probably will want a To Do
entry generated to advise an operator that a customer hasn't paid their deposit.

**FASTPATH:**
Refer to The Lifecycle Of A Severance Process And Its Eventsfor more information.

Please see Deposit Seizures When Other SAs Are Stopped for a description of how the system seizes an active deposit
service agreement when normal (i.e., non-cash deposit) service agreements are stopped.

After a deposit SA is stopped, it will be "final billed" the next time the account is billed. Refer to Refunding Deposits
for more information about how deposit refunds are "final billed". If a credit balance remains on the deposit SA after it
is final billed, the Write-Off Monitor will process the deposit SA just like it processes all unpaid and final billed service
agreements. If you set up the deposit SA's write-off controls properly (i.e., you plug in the appropriate refund and writedown algorithms), the write-off monitor will refund / write-down the credit balance (thus causing the deposit SA to close).

###### Deposit Seizures When Other SAs Are Stopped

Consider the situation when a severance process cuts a service due to non-payment. At some point, if the customer doesn't
pay, you'll want to seize the deposit and apply it to the overdue debt. To implement this, the system simply stops the deposit
SA when it stops the last SA in its deposit class (refer to Finalizing Pending Stops for more information about stopping
service agreements). Then, when the account is next billed, the standard deposit refund process will offset outstanding debt
before it is refunded to a customer.

Refer to Refunding Deposits for a complete description of how the system refunds a stopped deposit SA's balance to other
service agreements in its deposit class.


-----

**NOTE:**
**Deposit class refund method is the key. It's important to stress that the only way the system will use a deposit to offset**
overdue debt is if the deposit's deposit class has a refund method that does this. If you've set up a deposit class' refund
method to cut a check for the entire deposit amount, the system will not offset outstanding debt. Refer to Deposit Class Refund Method for more information.

###### Non-Cash Deposits

When an account is required to post a deposit, they can remit cash or some other type of surety (e.g., letters of credit, surety
bonds, 3 rd party deposits). When cash is remitted, a deposit service agreement is used. When some other type of surety is
used, a non-cash deposit must be created.

Non-cash deposits are held in respect of an account and an account may have an unlimited number of non-cash deposits
(note: cash deposits are held in respect of a deposit service agreement that is linked to remitting account). Refer to Account

- Deposits for more information.

Each non-cash deposit must reference a non-cash deposit type. Besides defining the type of surety, the non-cash deposit
type also controls:

- Whether such types of non-cash deposits can be highlighted when they are due to expire via the creation of a To Do entry
(refer to TD-NCDEX for more information about this To Do entry).

- Whether a reference to a cash-deposit (i.e., service agreement) must be specified. Refer to 3rd Party Deposits for more
information about how a cash deposit can be referenced by another party.

**FASTPATH:**
Refer to Setting Up Non-Cash Deposit Types for more information.

In addition to non-cash deposit type, each non-cash deposit must reference a deposit class. Why? Because the system
amalgamates cash and non-cash deposits when it determines if an account is holding an adequate deposit.

**FASTPATH:**
Refer to What Do Deposit Classes Do? for more information.

If you need to use a non-cash deposit to satisfy an account's debt, you must "cash in" the non-cash deposit. When the cash
arrives, create a payment and apply it to the customer's outstanding service agreements.

###### Third Party Deposits

A third party deposit arises when a third party remits cash to cover the deposit needs of one or more accounts. Both cash
and non-cash deposits must be created to record a third party deposit. The following example will explain how to do this.

Assume the Salvation Army remits $5,000 on behalf of 50 customers (where each customer's account is allocated $100). In
this situation, you'd create the following information in the system:

- The Salvation Army must have an account with a deposit service agreement.

- When the Salvation Army remits the funds:

**WARNING:**


-----

If you do not understand the difference between payoff balance and current balance, refer to Current Amount versus
Payoff Amount.

- Create an adjustment to "bill" the deposit service agreement (causing the deposit SA's current balance to be $5,000 and
the payoff balance to be 0).

- Add a payment for the $5,000 against the Salvation Army's account. This payment will cause the deposit SA's current
balance to be 0 and the payoff balance to be -$5,000. Note, if you don't mind the Salvation Army's current balance to be $5,000 after the payment is made, you wouldn't have to create the adjustment to "bill" the deposit.

- Create a non-cash deposit for each of the 50 accounts being covered by the cash deposit. On each non-cash deposit,
define the appropriate non-cash deposit type (e.g., 3rd party deposit) and amount $100 each.

- Interest will be applied to the Salvation Army's deposit service agreement as per the interest algorithm on the deposit
SA's deposit class.

- If you need to use the Salvation Army's payment to payoff overdue debt, you will use a transfer adjustment(s) to transfer
from the deposit service agreement to the respective overdue service agreement(s).

**IMPORTANT:**
Be aware that the system will allow the sum of third party deposits to exceed the amount of the cash deposit (in our
previous example, the system would allow you to create $6,000 worth of third party non-cash deposits even though only
$5,000 of cash was remitted).

###### Deposit Class Controls Everything

A deposit service agreement's SA type references a deposit class. The topics in this section describe how deposit class
controls the behavior of a deposit SA.

**FASTPATH:**
Refer to Setting Up Deposit Classes for a complete description of the business rules governed by a deposit class.

###### Controls Interest Calculation

Interest is applied to a deposit SA when:

- A deposit SA is stopped. Refer to Refunding Deposits for a description of how a deposit SA can be stopped.

- The Apply Interest background process (DEPINTRF) determined that sufficient time has passed since interest was last
calculated. The amount of time between interest calculations is defined on the deposit class.
A deposit SA's deposit class controls the following interest calculation functions:

  - The frequency of interest calculation.

  - The algorithm used to calculate the amount of interest (note, the interest rate is defined using a bill factor plugged in
on this algorithm).

  - The method used to refund the interest.

**NOTE:**
**Adjustments are used to apply interest. Interest is applied to a deposit SA using an adjustment (the adjustment type is**
also defined on the deposit class).


-----

###### Controls The Recommended Deposit Amount

The following events cause the calculation of the recommended deposit amount:

- The Deposit Review background process (DEPRVW) compares an account's existing deposit (if any) to the
recommended amount.

A user requests a deposit calculation for a new deposit service agreement by pressing the button on the Start
Confirmation.

A deposit service agreement's deposit class controls the algorithm used to derive the suggested deposit amount.

###### Defines The Conditions That Cause The System To Recommend A New or Additional Deposit

The Deposit Review background process (DEPRVW) will recommend an additional deposit be billed if the customer
doesn't satisfy the definition of a good customer.

It's important to be aware that if your company has multiple classes of deposits, the system will recommend deposits for
each individual deposit class used by an account. For example, if an account has both regulated and unregulated deposit
classes, the system will recommend separate deposits for each class.

When the Deposit Review process analyzes an account's debt, it uses the following deposit class attributes:

- The definition of a good customer (the system only recommends deposits for bad customers).

- The tolerance percent that must be exceeded before the system will recommend an additional deposit for a customer.
This tolerance percent prevents the recommendation of small amounts.

- The method used to derive the recommended deposit amount.

Assuming the C1-CR-UP-DRR review method algorithm is specified on the deposit class, the system does not automatically
produce bills when an additional deposit is needed. Rather, the system's recommendations appear on the Deposit Review
page. To implement a recommendation, an operator should change the deposit SA's Total Amount To Bill or add a new
deposit SA.

**NOTE:**
**Non-cash deposits are included. It's important to be aware that the system compares the recommended deposit amount**
against the sum of deposits on hand for a given deposit class. When amalgamating the total deposit on hand, the system
includes both cash (i.e., deposit SA's payoff balance) and non-cash deposits.

###### Defines Automatic Refund Conditions

The Deposit Refund background process (DEPRFND) will refund a deposit to a customer when conditions defined on the
deposit SA's deposit class are met. For example, a deposit's deposit class may indicate the system should automatically
refund a deposit after the deposit has been held for 6 months and the customer is a good customer (the definition of a "good
customer" is also on the deposit class).

###### Controls How Deposits Are Refunded To A Customer


-----

The method used to refund a deposit to a customer is defined on the deposit SA's deposit class. For example, a deposit's
deposit class may indicate the system will first apply the deposit to outstanding debt first and, if funds remain, cut a check.

It's important to be aware that if your company refunds deposits by first offsetting outstanding debt, the system will only
offset debt within an individual deposit class. For example, if a customer has two deposits - one for regulated debt, the other
for unregulated debt - the regulated deposit will only be used to offset regulated debt.

###### Deposit Background Processes

The topics in this section describe the background processes that automate deposit processing.

###### Deposit Interest

The Deposit Interest background process (DEPINTRF) examines all cash deposit service agreements (i.e., service
agreements with a SA type with a special role of Cash Deposit ). If enough time has passed since interest was last
calculated, interest will be calculated using the service agreement's deposit class' Interest Refund Algorithm. Note: interest
will be automatically calculated every X months where X is defined in the deposit class' Months Between Interest Refund.

###### Deposit Refund

The Deposit Refund background process (DEPRFND) examines all cash deposit service agreements (i.e., service
agreements with a SA type with a special role of Cash Deposit ). If the account meets the service agreement's deposit class'
Refund Criteria Algorithm, the system changes the service agreement's state to Pending Stop. Refer to Refunding Deposits
for a description of what happens next.

###### Review Deposits

The Review Deposits background process (DEPRVW) examines all accounts with service agreements that are governed
by a deposit class (i.e., service agreements with an SA type that references a deposit class). If the account fails the deposit
class' Good Customer Algorithm, the system calculates the recommended deposit amount (using the deposit class' Deposit
Recommendation Algorithm). If the recommended amount exceeds the amount of deposit currently requested, the system
will request an additional deposit. The deposit class' Review Method Algorithm is used to determine what action to take if
the system requests an additional deposit. The system's recommendations appear on the Deposit Review page.

You may optionally provide a Deposit Class as input to restrict the review to account whose service agreements reference
that deposit class.

**NOTE:**
**Preventing small recommendations. The system uses the deposit class's Review Tolerance Percentage to prevent the**
recommendation of small deposits by the Deposit Review background process. For example, if this field contains 10(%),
the system would only recommend an additional deposit if the existing requested deposit amount is less than 90% of the
recommended amount.

**Multiple deposits could be recommended for an account. Because an account can have service agreements that**
belong to multiple deposit classes, it is possible for a multiple recommendations to be generated for an account.


-----

##### Deposit Review

The Deposit Review page shows all accounts for which an additional deposit is recommended.

**NOTE:**
The Review Deposits background process inserts rows on this query.

**Multiple deposits could be recommended for an account. Because an account can have service agreements that**
belong to multiple deposit classes, it is possible for a multiple recommendations to be generated for an account.

Open this page using Menu > Financial Query > Deposit Review.

**Description of Page**

Use Account ID and / or Deposit Class to filter the rows. Each row displays and account / deposit class that holds an
inadequate deposit.

**NOTE:**
**Rows are also displayed for errors. Please be aware that if the Recommend Additional Deposit background process**
encounters an error when it attempts to calculate an account's recommended deposit, these errors also appear as rows in
this query.

Press the button to add a new deposit SA for the customer. Pressing this button causes Start/Stop Service to open.
When this page opens, you should create a new deposit service agreement for the customer (by referencing the appropriate
division / SA Type).

If the customer has one or more deposit service agreements, the drill button will be enabled. Pressing it will cause the
Service Agreement - Main Information page to open. When this page opens, you can change Total Amount To Bill to
reflect the total amount of deposit you want to hold. When billing next runs, it will bill the customer for the marginal
difference between the current deposit held and the deposit amount to bill.

**FASTPATH:**
Refer to Defines The Conditions That Cause The System To Recommend A New or Additional Deposit for how rows
are added to this query.

#### Statements

In this section, we describe how to manage your customer's statements.

##### The Big Picture of Complex Statements

Statements allow you to set up a person to receive a consolidated report of the financial activity for one or more accounts
and/or service agreements. This allows you to model complex account scenarios, including the following examples.

- Satellite offices for a company are each responsible for paying their own bill, but the head office would like a
consolidated report of the bills for all the satellite offices once a month. In this case, each satellite office is set up as an


-----

account covering the services for their office. The head office does not want to receive individual copies of each bill, but
rather a consolidated report of the financial activity for all the offices.

- The head office is responsible for paying the bill. The satellite offices should receive a copy of only their portion of the
bill. In this case, a service agreement is set up for each satellite office under the head office's account. Each satellite
office should receive a copy of the bill segment information for their office's service agreement.

- The head office is responsible for paying the bill. Multiple departments need to see copies of the electric portion of the
bill. As illustrated by this scenario, a service agreement or account may appear on many statements.


-----

The topics in this section provide additional information about how to set up statements.

###### Constructing Statements

Statements are produced for a person. Each statement contains the financial transactions for one or more service
agreements. The service agreements may belong to any number of accounts. Over time, a person may receive many
statements.

When setting up a person to receive statements, it's important to note that a person can receive different statements for
different groupings of service agreements. For example, the head office may want a statement of the financial details for the
western division offices separately from the eastern division offices.

For each separate statement a person wishes to receive, you will set up a statement construct. On the statement construct,
you define the service agreements and/or accounts whose financial information should appear on the statement. If you
specify an account on a statement construct, billing information for all the service agreements linked to the account will be
included on the statement. The superset of service agreements and accounts defined on a statement construct are called the
"construct details".

**FASTPATH:**
Refer to Statement Construct Maintenance for more information.

###### Producing Statements

 Statement Cycles

The accounts and service agreements linked to a statement construct may have different bill cycles and as a result, their bills
are produced on different dates. So when should a statement containing the consolidation of all this financial information be
produced? To answer this question, there is a statement cycle.

Just as with a bill cycle, the statement cycle has a schedule. A statement cycle's schedule controls when a statement should
be produced. Each statement construct will point to its own statement cycle.

**FASTPATH:**


-----

Refer to Statement Construct Maintenance and Statement Cycle for more information.

###### Create Statements Background Process

This statement construction background process (STMPRD) is responsible for periodically creating statements. It works as
follows:

- All statement cycles are selected with pending schedules whose production date is on or before the business date.

- For each such cycle, all of its statement constructs are selected. For each statement construct:

  - If a statement already exists for the cycle schedule and construct, it is deleted (this allows for reproduction after
a mess up). Note well, this is true even if the statement is printed as you may have only spotted the problem after
viewing the printed statement.

  - A statement is created.

  - All SAs associated with the construct details effective on the business date are extracted.

  - All "SA snapshots" associated with bills whose BILL DATE is within the construct detail's start and end dates that
are not already linked to one of the construct's statements are linked to the new statement. Note, an "SA snapshot" is
created for every service agreement linked to an account when a bill is completed for an account.

  - If no "SA snapshots" are found, the statement is removed.

**NOTE:**
The following diagram illustrates how the above logic could result in multiple bills for a single service agreement being
linked to the same statement.

**FASTPATH:**
Refer to Statement Maintenance for more information about a statement and its details.

**NOTE:**


-----

**This process is rerunnable. If a problem occurred during the statement creation, simply run the background process**
again. It will clean up all existing statements for each construct in the current cycle schedule and start again.

**FASTPATH:**
Refer to Printing Statements for more information for how a separate background process uses the information snapshot
on a statement to construct the extract file used to print the statements.

###### Statement Routing

Just as with bills, statements require routing information in order for the system to understand how and where to send the
statements. For example, the system needs to know the method of routing, the number of copies and the format of the
statement. This information is captured on a statement construct.

###### Where Are Statements Sent

The system extracts a statement's address as per its statement construct's address source. Note, if the address source is
Person and the person has a seasonal address effective on the business date, the seasonal address will be used.

If you need to reprint a statement because it was addressed incorrectly, correct the person's address, and then reprint the
statement (by pressing the Reprint button on the statement). When you press this button, the statement will be marked for
downloading. When your download process next runs, it simply extracts the statement construct's current address.

###### On-Line Statement Production

Statements may be produced on-line as well as in batch. To produce a statement on-line, simply go to the Statement page,
select the correct Construct ID and choose the Generate button.

This statement will include the financial information related to bills for the accounts and service agreements linked to this
construct, with the following criteria:

- The bills do not already appear on a statement

- The bill dates fall within the "effective period" for the statement construct. In other words, the bill falls within the start
and end period for the statement construct details.

**FASTPATH:**
Refer to Statement Maintenance for more information.

###### How to Regenerate a Specific Statement

There may be times when a specific statement needs to be regenerated. For example, perhaps a cancel / rebill has occurred
since the statement was produced, and you wish to recreate the statement to reflect this.

If you need to regenerate a statement using up-to-date information, simply delete the statement and generate a new
statement. This may be done on-line.

**NOTE:**


-----

Statements may be deleted, even if they have already been printed. This enables you to delete and regenerate statements.

**FASTPATH:**
Refer to Statement Maintenance for more information.

###### Printing Statements

The contents of this section describe the technical implementation of printing statements.

###### Statement Route Types Control The Information Merged Onto Statements

Every statement references a statement route type. The route type controls the following statement print functions:

- It contains an algorithm that is responsible for extracting the information merged onto your statements. Specifically,
algorithms of this type create the "flat file records" that are passed to your statement print software. Algorithms of this
type are called under the following scenarios:

  - The background process that builds the flat file that's passed to your statement print software calls these algorithms to
construct the "flat file records" for each statement.

  - If your statement print software has the ability to construct a real-time image of a statement (in a PDF), you can plugin an Online Statement Image algorithm on the Installation Record. This type of algorithm will call the statement's
dispatch group extract algorithm to extract the information that is merged onto the statement. Refer to Technical
Implementation Of Online Statement Display for the details.

- Refer to The Statement Extract Records for examples of the record layouts passed to the document composition
application.

- It contains the ID of the background process that builds the flat file that's passed to your statement print software.
The base package example of this process (STMDWLD) simply calls each statement's construct's route type's extract
algorithm to format the information placed onto the flat file.

###### Technical Implementation Of Online Statement Display

Users can view an image of any statement if you setup the following:

- Plug-in an Online Statement Display algorithm on the Installation Record. Refer to ONSD-ST for an example of such an
algorithm. Note, if your statement print software is not capable of producing a PDF containing an image of a statement,
users will not be able to view images of statements.

- Plug-in the appropriate extract algorithm on each statement route type. Algorithms of this type format the records that
contain the information that is passed to your printing software. Refer to STEX-TX for an example of such an algorithm.

When you plug-in these algorithms, a button appears on Statement - Main. When a user presses this button, the following
takes place:

- The installation record's Online Statement Display algorithm is executed.

- This algorithm calls the statement's route type's extract algorithm. This algorithm constructs the information that's
merged onto the statement and returns it to the Online Statement Display algorithm. This algorithm, in turn, passes it to
your statement print software.


-----

- Your statement print software renders an image of the statement in a PDF and returns it to the Online Statement Display
algorithm.

- And finally, the Online Statement Display algorithm displays the PDF in a separate Adobe session.

###### Technical Implementation Of Printing Statements In Batch

The background process that extracts statement information (STMDWLD) reads all statements in a given run number that
are marked with its batch control ID. For each statement, it creates numerous records on a flat file. These records contain
the information that is merged onto your statements.

The base package example of this process (STMDWLD) simply calls the extract algorithm on the statement route type to
format the information placed onto the flat file. Refer to Statement Route Types Control The Information On Statements for
more information.

**NOTE:**
**If your software doesn't support online statement display. The algorithm that formats statement extract records that's**
plugged in on statement route type serves two purposes: 1) it formats the records used to construct online images of a
statement, and 2) it formats the records downloaded to your statement print software in batch. If your statement print
software does not support the rendering of statement images real time, there is no need to create an extract algorithm.
Rather, you should simply develop your own download process that both formats the extract records and downloads
them (and then specify this batch process on your statement route type).

###### Reproducing The Statement Print Flat File

You can reproduce the flat file at any time. Simply request the STMDWLD process and specify the run number associated
with the historic run.

###### How To Reprint A Specific Statement

If you need to reprint a specific statement, navigate to Statement - Main and press the Reprint button.

If your implementation has enabled the online creation of statement images, you can also press the Display Statement
button on this page and then print the resultant PDF on your local printer.

###### The Statement Extract Records

Numerous different types of records are interfaced to the document composition application. However, they all share a
common structure:

- The first 4 bytes are called the Printer Key. This field is a record type used by the document composition application
statement template.

- The next 186 bytes are called the Sort Key. This field is used to ensure the various records used to construct a printed
statement appear in the correct order in the interface file.

will appear on statements.

- **Construct Detail ID is a system generated unique identifier of the construct detail.**

##### Statement Maintenance

Statements allow you to set up a Person to receive a consolidated report of the financial activity for one or more accounts
and/or service agreements. The topics in this section describe how to maintain statements.

**NOTE:**
**The system creates most statements behind-the-scenes. Most statements are created by the system when it processes**
the statement cycle schedule. You should only have to access the statement pages to regenerate a statement or to
add a statement real-time. For information about how the system creates statements, refer to The Statement Creation
Background Process.

###### Lifecycle of a Statement

The following diagram illustrates the lifecycle of a statement.

**Pending: A statement is created in this state and will remain in this state until the statement details are extracted. When that**
occurs, it will transition to printed.

**Printed: A statement transitions to this state after the details of a statement have been extracted.**

###### Statement - Main

transactions appear.

#### Sales & Marketing

The sales and marketing functionality satisfies many diverse requirements. For example, you can use this functionality to:

- Enroll new customers using a single transaction (i.e., you don't have to use the person, premise, service point, and start/
stop transactions to enroll a new customer who resides at a new premise).

- Sell new products to existing customers.


-----

- Update person, account and premise information using a single transaction.

- Market your services to prospects from a marketing list (and measure the success of your efforts). If the customer
responds to your sales efforts, the system will automatically setup the customer, premise and related service agreements.

- Setup marketing surveys and record your customers' responses.

- Quickly create one-time charges.

- Setup proposals for prospective services (and then send a quotation to the customer for these services).

- And more...

The topics in this section provide more information about the sales and marketing functions.

##### The Big Picture of Campaigns, Packages, and Orders

Three objects are at the heart of the sales and marketing functionality: Campaigns, Packages, and Orders.

- A package defines a basket of goods and services that can be offered to a customer or a prospect.

- A campaign is a structured effort to offer a given set of packages to existing customers or new prospects.

- An order is created for each customer / prospect to which a campaign is targeted.

The topics in this section provide background information about these objects.

###### An Overview of Campaigns, Packages and Orders

An order is used to define:

- Demographic information about a customer / prospect.

- Geographic information about the service address.

- The customer's response to eligibility-oriented questions. For example, you can pose questions like: Who is your current
energy service provider? / Would you like to pay automatically? / What is your date of birth?

After the above information is defined, the order transaction presents packages that may be offered to the customer. A
package controls the various types of service agreements that will be created if the customer selects the package.

**NOTE:**
**The customer must be eligible for a package. When you setup a package, you define its eligibility criteria. For**
example, you can setup a package that is only applicable to commercial customers in Toronto who pay automatically
and who commit to a one-year service contract.

If the customer elects to take a package, the order transaction sets up / updates the "V" (along with all of the ancillary things
that happen when service is initiated, e.g., field activities are created). Please note that in addition to setting up the "V", it's
also possible to populate / update other information when a package is selected. For example, you could have the system
setup the customer's automatic payment options.

**NOTE:**
**An order can be completed without creating service agreements. It is possible to use the order transaction to simply**
create / update persons and accounts. Refer to Marketing Surveys and Setting up a New Customer Prior To Using Start/
Stop for more information.

All orders must reference a campaign. An order's campaign defines:


-----

- How the campaign's orders use accounts and premises. For example, you can indicate that a given campaign is only
targeted at existing premises (thus preventing the creation of a new premise when an order is completed).

- The type of information defaulted onto an order. For example, you can setup a campaign to default a given account
management group on all orders linked to the campaign. This account management group will subsequently default onto
the new account when the order is completed.

- The validation rules that control how its orders use accounts and premises. Specifically, on a campaign you define if
an account / premise is required / optional / not allowed on its orders. In addition, if an account / premise is required or
optional, you can control whether new accounts / premises can be created when an order is completed (the alternative
is to force each order to use an existing account / premise). These controls prevent the unwanted proliferation of new
accounts and premises for campaigns that are targeted at existing accounts and premises.

- The eligibility-oriented questions that are posed to the customer when an order is taken. For example, the questions
indicated above - Who is your current energy service provider? / Would you like to pay automatically? / What is your
date of birth? - are all defined on the order's campaign.

- The superset of packages that can be offered to a customer whose order references this campaign. An order's campaign
defines the types of packages that may be selected.

- In addition to the above, campaigns also control high-level eligibility rules and business process flows.

**NOTE:**
**Bottom line.Campaigns allow you to define a group of packages that a customer is eligible to purchase. Every time a**
campaign is targeted at a customer, an Order is created. The information entered on the order qualifies the customer for
one of the campaign's packages. If a customer elects to take a package, the "V" is setup / updated along with all of the
ancillary things that happen when service is initiated, e.g., field activities are created, workflow processes are initiated,
etc.

###### Supported Business Processes

Before providing examples of specific business processes, we'd like to highlight that you have control over some aspects
of the user-interface flow (i.e., the screen navigation is not hard-coded). The following illustration highlights the potential
user-interface flow:

**NOTE:**


-----

**Bottom line. You can navigate to the order transaction from many places in the system. After you complete an order,**
you are transferred to an appropriate transaction. The specific transaction is controlled by you when you setup the order's
campaign.

The topics that follow illustrate specific business process flows that are possible in your implementation of the sales and
marketing functionality.

###### Marketing to Prospects from a Marketing List

The following business process flow illustrates how the sales and marketing functionality would be used to market to
prospects uploaded from a marketing database.

The following points describe the steps in this business process:

- An upload interface creates an order for each entry in a marketing database.

**NOTE:**
The system is not supplied with a dedicated interface to upload a marketing list.

- Each order is routed to a salesperson via a To Do entry (or via a predictive dialer if your company supports this type of
technology).

- The first step in the salesperson's interaction with the prospect will be to confirm the information uploaded from the
marketing list (e.g., is your Bob Smith?, is your address 15 Main St?, etc.). Any changes are made to the information
saved on the order.

- The salesperson's next step involves posing eligibility-oriented questions related to the campaign. Examples of questions
include:

  - **What is your date of birth? This type of question might be asked if you have packages that are only marketed to**
senior citizens. Potential answers would be a valid date that's in the past.

  - **Would you be interested in our full-service option (electricity, digital cable and gas)? Potential options are: yes**
and no.

  - **Who is your current electric service provider? Potential answers are: Utility.Com, Reliant Resources, Other.**

  - **Would you like to pay automatically? Potential answers are: Yes, No.**

  - **Would you like to pay using a levelized payment plan? Potential answers are: Yes, No.**

  - Etc.


-----

- The gathered information is saved on the order and then the system displays the packages that can be offered to the
customer. The available packages may be restricted based on information on the order. For example, some packages
are only applicable to senior citizens, while others are only applicable to customers whose current service provider is
Utility.com.

- If the customer is interested in a package, the salesperson selects it. Prior to the order being completed, the package
confirmation page is shown. On this page are additional instructions about the package and a description of how the
system will be updated if the package is selected (e.g., the types of service agreements will be displayed). In addition, the
package may require additional information before it can be chosen. For example, the package may only be selectable if
the customer agrees to pay automatically. In this situation, the package confirmation page will require the salesperson to
enter the customer's bank and bank account.

- After entering all package-specific information, the order is completed. When the order is completed, the "V" is setup
and all work necessary to satisfy the order is initiated (e.g., field activities are created, workflow processes are initiated,
etc.).

- And finally, the user is returned to Control Central - Account Info where an overview of the customer is displayed. From
this page, the user can drill down to any service agreement (or to start/stop) to perform any fine-tuning.

- Please be aware that the page to which you are transferred after order completion is controlled by a field on the order's
campaign. In our example, it made sense to transfer the user to Control Central as it provides a nice confirmation to the
user (it shows a great deal of information about an account). However, you could setup the campaign to take the user to
virtually any page in the system. You'll see good examples later in this discussion.

###### Marketing to Pre-Selected Customers

The following business process flow illustrates how the sales and marketing functionality would be used to market
additional services to existing customers selected by a background process.

The following points describe the steps in this business process:

- A background process creates an order for each customer to be targeted under a marketing campaign.

**NOTE:**
The base package does not have an example of such a background process. Please speak to your support team if you
require assistance in developing this type of process.

- Sales people would then process the order as described above.


-----

###### Real-Time Marketing of Additional Services to a Customer

The following business process flow illustrates how the sales and marketing functionality would be used to market
additional services to existing customers when they call in.

The following points describe the steps in this business process:

- When you find the customer's record on Control Central - Search, you are automatically transferred to the Account
Information portal. One of the zones on this page contains the campaigns that can be offered to the customer.

**NOTE:**
The "potential campaigns" zone only appears if the CSR has modified their preferences to display this zone.

- If you select a campaign from this zone, you are transferred to the Order transaction.

**NOTE:**
An order's campaign controls whether the Main or Questions & Misc Fields tab is initially displayed when the order
transaction is invoked from this zone. For example, you might want to have the Main tab displayed if you want the
order-taker to confirm the customer's demographic information before posing questions. Alternatively, you may want
to skip this step and immediately present the order-taker with the campaign's questions. Keep in mind that the user can
always display the other tab regardless of what is initially displayed.

- You then process the order as described above.

**NOTE:**
**An easy way to create one-time charges. The above business process illustrates how the selection of a package will**
create one or more new service agreements for a customer. If your organization levies one-time charges (e.g., tree
trimming charges, damage assessments, etc.), you can also use the order transaction to create both a "one-time charge"
service agreement and create the related billable charge when the order is completed. To do this, setup a campaign with
a separate package for each possible one-time charge. If an order is created for this type of campaign and the relevant
package is selected, the system will setup the new billable charge service agreement and link the billable charge to it.
Refer to An Easier Way To Create One Time Charges for an example of such a campaign.

###### Real-Time Marketing of Services to a Prospect


-----

The following business process flow illustrates how the sales and marketing functionality would be used to market services
when a new customer calls.

**WARNING:**
We do not recommend using this business process if your organization's service territory is predefined (i.e., if you've set
up the premises and service points for your entire service territory). Why? Because it can result in the creation of new
premises and / or service points and you probably don't want this to happen if you've already set everything up. While
it is possible to disable the creation of new service points and premises by developing new plug-ins, we'd recommend
using the business process described under How To Add A New Customer From Control Central if a new customer
calls in and you have predefined premises and service points.

The following points describe the steps in this business process:

- You look for the customer using Control Central - Search. Because the customer is new, you push the Add Order button
on Control Central to transfer to the Order transaction.

- You then process the order as described above.

In order to take advantage of the above business process, it's important that you understand the following points:

- When the order page is opened for a new customer, the order's campaign is defaulted from the installation record. The
default campaign on the installation record is "generic" because we don't know anything about the customer (they are
new) and therefore we cannot default a campaign targeted to their customer class or geography.

- This default campaign on the installation record must be constructed using one of the following approaches:

  - The default campaign has a package for every potential type of customer who can call up. While this is possible, it's
probably not realistic as the data setup burden required to define every type of package could be onerous. However, if
you have a limited number of service agreements, this approach is feasible.

  - The default campaign could just be a "dummy" campaign that has no packages. The "real" campaigns will only be
shown after basic information about the customer has been recorded on the order and the "show eligibility" button is
pressed. These campaigns appear in the order's eligibility tree. The selection of a campaign in this tree will cause the
order's campaign to be switched. Note, because the "dummy" campaign has no packages, no packages will appear in
the order's eligibility tree when the dummy campaign is referenced on an order.

- The order is then processed as described above.

###### Setting up a New Customer Prior To Using Start/Stop

The following business process flow illustrates how the sales and marketing functionality would be used to create a new
customer prior to using Start/Stop to start service at an existing premise.


-----

**NOTE:**
The following business process is similar to that described under How To Add A New Customer From Control Central.
The only difference is that the Order transaction is used to create a new person and account rather than the Person
transaction. The order transaction may be a better choice because it lets you define many attributes on person, account
and premise that are not accessible on the person page. For example, the order transaction lets you define the customer's
automatic payment option, bill after date, override due date, etc. In addition, on an order's campaign, you can define
default values of many field values (both real fields and characteristics). These default values are presented on the order
transaction and may be overridden by the user at will.

The following points describe the steps in this business process:

- You look for the customer using Control Central - Search. Because the customer is new, you push the "Add Order"
button on Control Central to transfer to the Order transaction.

- You record additional demographic and geographic information about the new customer and confirm all values defaulted
from the order's campaign. After all required information is entered, you press the Update Cust. Info and Go To Start/
Stop button to create the new person and account and transfer to Start/Stop to identify the new services desired by the
customer.

**NOTE:**
**The button's existence and label are dynamic. In the above example, we indicated that there is a button on the order**
page called Update Cust. Info and Go To Start/Stop. This button's presence on the page and its label are controlled
by fields on the campaign. When pressed, the "V" is updated with information on the order and the user is transferred to
the "post completion" page (which is also defined on the campaign). You would only enable this button on campaigns
whose orders can be completed without selecting a package. In the above example, the campaign doesn't have any
packages (because service is intended to be started using Start/Stop). In Examples of Campaigns and Packages we show
other examples of how these fields would be setup for different types of campaigns.

In order to take advantage of the above business process, it's important that you understand the following points:

- When the order page is opened as a result of pressing the Add Order button on Control Central - Search, the order's
campaign is defaulted from the installation record. The default campaign on the installation record is "generic" because
nothing is known about the new customer and therefore it is impossible to default a campaign targeted to their customer
class or geography.

- The campaign on the installation record should be setup to contain default information for the "average" customer. For
example, if you typically deal with residential customers, the information on the default campaign should be residentialoriented.


-----

- When a user takes an order for a new customer, they'll change the default information when appropriate. For example,
if an industrial customer were being added, they'd change the customer class to "industrial" and then ask to see the
campaigns such a customer is eligible to choose (these alternate campaigns are displayed in the order's eligibility tree).
For example, if you've setup campaigns with eligibility rules that are targeted at industrial customers and the customer
class on the order has been changed to "industrial", the user will see these campaigns in the eligibility tree. The user can
then change the campaign's order by simply clicking on the desired campaign.

**NOTE:**
The above example illustrates how an order can be completed without causing the creation of service agreements. Refer
to Marketing Surveys and Prelude to Start Stop for examples of such campaigns.

###### Examples of Campaigns and Packages

The topics that follow provide examples of campaigns and packages that support several different scenarios. Your
organization's campaigns and packages may differ markedly from these examples. Factors that will influence your sales and
marketing objects include:

- Whether the type of goods and services marketed to your customers / prospects differs depending on some trait of the
customer or the region in which they are located. For example,

  - Your company may have very straightforward packages that only differ based on whether the customer is industrial,
residential or commercial. If this describes your company, the setup process will be simple.

  - Alternatively, your company might offer different packages to residential customers based on whether they pay
automatically, whether the customer is a senior citizen, whether they purchase multiple services from you, etc. If
this describes your company, then you'll have to define the various eligibility criteria and the respective packages
applicable to customers who satisfy each criterion.

- Whether premises exist prior to order taking. For example, a company that distributes a commodity has a well-defined
geographic area and therefore new premises typically don't arise when orders are taken.

- Whether your company offers many different types of goods and services.

- Whether your rates have charges / discounts that are only applied to some customers. For example, you might have
discounts that are applied if the customer is a senior citizen or an employee.

- Which of the Supported Business Processes you implement.

Use the information that follows to form an intuitive understanding of campaigns and packages. After attaining this
understanding, you'll be ready to design your own campaigns and packages.

###### Campaigns Without Packages

An order that references a campaign without packages will never create service agreements. The following topics describe
scenarios when such a campaign would be used.

###### Marketing Surveys

Some organizations conduct "marketing surveys" to determine general trends amongst their customer base. The following
diagram illustrates how such a campaign might look:


-----

Note the following about this campaign:

- If the campaign is used to establish new customers, you can define information to default onto orders created for
new customers. Because marketing surveys are targeted at existing customers, you don't need new customer default
information on the campaign.

- You can define questions to be posed to customers when an order is taken when you setup a campaign. For a "marketing
survey" campaign, you'd define each of the survey questions and the permissible answers. When a customer is surveyed,
an order is created and their answers are saved on the order.

- On a campaign, you can define additional fields to be updated on persons, accounts and premises when orders associated
with the campaign are completed. For example, you could indicate that the account's override due date and automatic
payment options should be confirmed when an order is taken. Because marketing surveys are typically only asking
questions, you wouldn't need to define additional customer information fields to be confirmed. However, you can if you
want.

- All campaigns need at least one eligibility rule. These rules control whether the campaign appears in the "eligible
campaigns" content zone when a customer is selected on Control Central. These rules also control whether the campaign
appears on an order's eligibility tree (campaigns that appear in this tree are alternate campaigns that may be used on the
order). Our example has assumed that this is a residential customer survey and therefore it only needs a single eligibility
rule. Refer to The Big Picture Of Campaign Eligibility Rules for more information.

- Because this campaign is used purely to manage a marketing survey, it doesn't need any packages. Packages are only
necessary if service agreements are created when an order is completed.


-----

- Because this campaign doesn't have packages, we have indicated that the button that allows orders to be completed
without selecting a package is enabled. If you don't enable this button, a user won't be able to complete a marketing
survey (and it is only during order completion when the "V" is updated with the information on the order). Notice that we
have assigned the button a label of Complete Survey.

- This campaign should be setup to transfer the user to Control Central - Account Info after the survey is completed.

###### Prelude to Start/Stop

Consider the example illustrated above under Setting up a New Customer Prior To Start/Stop. In this example, the order
transaction is used to create a new person and account; no service agreements are created when the order is completed.
Rather, after the order is completed, the user is automatically transferred to Start/Stop where they can create service
agreements. The following diagram illustrates how such a campaign might look:

Note the following about this campaign:

- Because this campaign is used to establish new customers, you should define new customer default information. The
order taker can override these default values.

- If we assume you don't ask marketing / eligibility-oriented questions when you take-on a new customer then this
campaign would not require any questions.


-----

- On a campaign, you can define additional fields to be updated on the related person, account and premise when orders
associated with the campaign are completed. For example, you could indicate that the account's override due date and
automatic payment options should be confirmed when an order is taken. In our example, we are assuming that we want
to define the customer's automatic payment options and their date of birth.

- As described under Marketing Surveys, a campaign's eligibility rule(s) control whether the campaign appears in the
"eligible campaigns" content zone and on an order's eligibility tree. This campaign is odd in that we don't want it to ever
appear as an "eligible campaign" because it's only used for NEW customers. In order to make this work you must:

  - Define an eligibility algorithm on this campaign that prevents it from appearing as an "eligible campaigns". Refer to A
Campaign That Is Never Eligible for more information.

  - Update the installation record to indicate that this campaign is the one that should be used on orders created when a
user presses the "Add an Order" button on Control Central - Search. Refer to Setting up a New Customer Prior To
Starting Service for more information about the flow of this business process.

- Because this campaign is used purely to add accounts and persons, it doesn't need any packages. Packages are only
necessary if service agreements are created when an order is completed.

- Because this campaign doesn't have packages, we have indicated that the button that allows an order to be completed
without selecting a package is enabled. If you don't enable this button, a user won't be able to complete the order (and
it is only during order completion when the "V" is updated with the information on the order). Notice that we have
assigned the button a label of Update The V and Go To Start.

- This campaign should be setup to transfer the user to Start/Stop after the order is completed.

###### Campaigns With Simple Packages

As explained under Campaigns Without Packages, there are several situations that might necessitate a campaign without
packages. In this section, we describe simple scenarios of campaigns with packages.

###### An Easier Way To Create One Time Charges

We use the term "one-time charge" to describe ad hoc charges, e.g., tree trimming charges, damage assessments, etc. The
following points describe how one-time charges are levied if you don't use the order transaction:

- Determine if the customer to be invoiced already has an appropriate "one-time charge" service agreement. If one doesn't
exist, you must create one using Start/Stop Service.

- Next, a billable charge is added to the "one-time charge" service agreement (using Billable Charge Maintenance).
The billable charge contains the invoice lines and amounts. The system will produce the bill for this charge when the
account's bill cycle next executes.

Rather than going through the above multi-step process, you can also use the order transaction to create both a "one-time
charge" service agreement AND create the billable charge. In addition, if the customer receiving the charge is new, the
order transaction will also create a new person and account at the same time.

To take advantage of this facility, you must set up a campaign that has a separate package for each type of one-time charge
as illustrated below. When an order is taken for such a campaign, the user simply selects the package that corresponds
with the desired one-time charge. The system will then create the necessary customer and financial information when the
package is confirmed.

**NOTE:**
**Billing of one-time charges. The order transaction will not cause a bill to be generated for the customer. Rather, the**
next time the account is billed, the system will see that there's an unbilled billable charge and create a bill segment for
it. This bill segment will appear on the customer's regular bill along with their other charges. If you'd prefer to create
the bill for the one-time charges immediately, you could setup the campaign to automatically transfer the user to the


-----

bill transaction where they can create an ad hoc bill. If you do this, you'll need to create a new plug-in algorithm on the
billable charge SA type to automatically activate the service agreement when it is created (otherwise the user would
have to manually activate the billable charge service agreement before the bill can be generated).

Note the following about this campaign:

- One-time charges can be levied against both new and existing customers. This means that orders associated with this
campaign may cause new customers to be created. Therefore, we have specified information to default onto orders for
new customers on the campaign. Note that we defined "residential-oriented" default values as the majority of one-time
charges are levied against residential customers.

- If we assume you don't ask marketing / eligibility-oriented questions when you levy a one-time charge then this
campaign would not require any questions.

- We have assumed that you are not capturing miscellaneous fields when you levy a one-time charge.

- As described under Marketing Surveys, all campaigns need at least one eligibility rule. We have assumed that this
campaign's packages can be selected by all types of customers and have therefore specified an eligibility algorithm that
will be true for all customers.

- Because this campaign has packages, we have indicated that the button that allows an order to be completed without
selecting a package is disabled. This means a user must choose one of the packages to complete the order.

- You might want to setup this campaign to automatically transfer the user to the bill transaction after the order is
completed. See the note above the illustration for more information.

- We have assumed that this campaign can be used to levy two kinds of one-time charges - a tree trimming charge and a
damaged line charge - and therefore this campaign requires two packages. Note the following about each package:

  - A package's eligibility rules control whether the package can be selected when an order is taken. With more
sophisticated campaigns, you may have packages that are only applicable to certain types of customers. In our


-----

example, we've assumed that these types of one-time charges can be levied against all customers and have therefore
used "universal" eligibility criteria (i.e., there are no eligibility restrictions). Refer to A Package That Is Always
Eligible for more information.

  - On a package, it's possible to define additional questions to be posed if a package is selected. In our example, there are
no additional questions to be posed for the one-time charge packages.

  - On a package, it's possible to define additional fields to be captured if a package is selected. In our example, there are
no additional fields to be captured.

  - On a package, you define the types of service agreements to be created if a package is selected. In our example, we
only need a single service agreement created / updated if the package is selected and therefore there's just one entry in
**SAs To Create. Please note the following about the information used to create this service agreement:**

- The SA Type is one that's used for a billable charge service agreement.

- The SA Type's Start Option is one that will automatically create a billable charge when a service agreement is created
(if a start option references a billable charge template, a billable charge will be created when this start option is used). In
our example, we have assumed a different start option has been setup for each type of one-time charge.

- Billable charge service agreements do not require service points and therefore SP Type is not applicable.

- We've indicated a Start Algorithm of Billable Charge . Refer to STRM-AS for an example of such an algorithm (type).

###### Campaigns With Complex Packages

The Campaigns With Simple Packages illustrated campaigns with very simple packages. In this section, we describe a
campaign with more complex packages.

###### Packages Limited By Answers And Field Values

Assume your organization has a campaign with several packages. Each package has the following restrictions in respect of
its use:

- "Package 1" can be offered to residential customers in California who are senior citizens.

- "Package 2" can be offered to residential customers in California who live in single-family homes who are not senior
citizens and who heat their homes with electricity.

- "Package 3" can be offered to residential customers in California who live in single-family homes who are not senior
citizens and who heat their homes with gas.

- "Package 4" can be offered to residential customers in California who live in multi-family homes who are not senior
citizens.

Also assume that all customers are encouraged to pay automatically.

The following diagram illustrates how such a campaign might look:


-----

The topics that follow describe the campaign and packages used to support this scenario. We'll start by explaining each
package. Then we'll describe how the campaign will be setup. This seems backwards, but it mirrors how you should design
this type of campaign:

- Senior Citizen Package

- Single-Family Electric Package

- Single-Family Gas Package

- Multi-Family Package

- The Campaign

**Senior Citizen Package**

The package that is offered to residential customers in California who are senior citizens has the following traits:

- It has eligibility rules that restrict its use to customers who meet the following criteria:


-----

  - Customer class = Residential

  - Division = California

  - Birth date equates to that of a senior citizen

- We only need a single service agreement created if the package is selected and therefore there's just one entry in SAs To
Create. Please note the following about the information used to create this service agreement:

  - The SA Type is one that's used for an electric residential service agreement (hence the E-RES SA type).

  - The SA Type's Start Option is one that will automatically setup the service agreement with the appropriate rate and
contract options for a senior citizen.

  - The service agreement needs to be linked to an electric residential service point (hence the E-RES SP type).

  - We've indicated a Start Algorithm of Start SP Service. Refer to STRM-VT for an example of such an algorithm
(type).

- We have not shown additional questions or miscellaneous fields in this package. This is because this package doesn't
have additional questions or additional fields.

Top of the Page

**Single-Family Electric Package**

The package that is offered to residential customers in California who live in single-family homes who are not senior
citizens and who heat their homes with electricity has the following traits:

- It has eligibility rules that restrict its use to customers who meet the following criteria:

  - Customer class = Residential

  - Division = California

  - Birth date does not equate to that of a senior citizen

  - The premise is a single-family home

  - The premise is heated with electricity

- We only need a single service agreement created if the package is selected and therefore there's just one entry in SAs To
Create. Please note the following about the information used to create this service agreement:

  - The SA Type is one that's used for an electric residential service agreement (hence the E-RES SA type).

  - The SA Type's Start Option is one that will automatically setup the service agreement with the appropriate rate and
contract options for this type of customer.

  - The service agreement needs to be linked to an electric residential service point (hence the E-RES SP type).

  - We've indicated a Start Algorithm of Start SP Service. Refer to STRM-VT for an example of such an algorithm
(type).

- We have not shown additional questions or miscellaneous fields in this package. This is because this package doesn't
have additional questions or additional fields.

Top of the Page

**Single-Family Gas Package**

The package that is offered to residential customers in California who live in single-family homes who are not senior
citizens and who heat their homes with gas has the following traits:

- It has eligibility rules that restrict its use to customers who meet the following criteria:

  - Customer class = Residential

  - Division = California


-----

  - Birth date does not equate to that of a senior citizen

  - The premise is a single-family home

  - The premise is heated with gas

- We only need a single service agreement created if the package is selected and therefore there's just one entry in SAs To
Create. Please note the following about the information used to create this service agreement:

  - The SA Type is one that's used for a gas residential service agreement (hence the G-RES SA type).

  - The SA Type's Start Option is one that will automatically setup the service agreement with the appropriate rate and
contract options for this type of customer.

  - The service agreement needs to be linked to a gas residential service point (hence the G-RES SP type).

  - We've indicated a Start Algorithm of Start SP Service. Refer to STRM-VT for an example of such an algorithm
(type).

- We have not shown additional questions or miscellaneous fields in this package. This is because this package doesn't
have additional questions or additional fields.

Top of the Page

**Multi-Family Package**

The package that is offered to residential customers in California who live in multi-family homes who are not senior citizens
has the following traits:

- It has eligibility rules that restrict its use to customers who meet the following criteria:

  - Customer class = Residential

  - Division = California

  - Birth date does not equates to that of a senior citizen

  - The premise is a multi-family home

- This package requires additional information that was not requested at the campaign-level. We're going to assume that
the multi-family rate needs to know the number of units in the building. This means that this package needs an additional
field (number of units).

- We only need a single service agreement created if the package is selected and therefore there's just one entry in SAs To
Create. Please note the following about the information used to create this service agreement:

  - The SA Type is one that's used for an electric residential service agreement (hence the E-RES SA type).

  - The SA Type's Start Option is one that will automatically setup the service agreement with the appropriate rate and
contract options for this type of customer.

  - The service agreement needs to be linked to an electric residential service point (hence the E-RES SP type).

  - We've indicated a Start Algorithm of Start SP Service. Refer to STRM-VT for an example of such an algorithm
(type).

- We have not shown additional questions in this package. This is because this package doesn't have additional questions.

Top of the Page

**The Campaign**

Note the following about this campaign:

- Orders can be created for both new and existing customers. Because new customers are possible, we have specified
information to default onto orders for new customers. Note that we defined "residential-oriented" default values (but
remember, these values can be overridden on the order).


-----

- The questions on the campaign are those whose answers play a part in each package's eligibility. You could also ask
additional marketing survey-oriented questions that have nothing to do with package eligibility.

- The miscellaneous fields highlight an interesting situation. Notice that the date-of-birth and "automatic payment" fields
are optional. However the field that holds the number of dwelling units is "only applicable on packages". When a field
has this designation, the user will only be prompted to supply this field's value if a package is chosen where this field is
applicable. In our example, only the Multi Family Package uses this field. This package will be setup to indicate that this
field is required whereas the other packages will be setup to indicate that this field is not used.

**NOTE:**
**Bottom line. The "miscellaneous fields" on a campaign must also include package-specific fields.**

- All campaigns need at least one "highlight rule". These rules control whether the campaign appears in the "eligible
campaigns" content zone when a customer is selected on Control Central. Also note that "highlight rules" also control
whether the campaign appears on an order's eligibility tree (campaigns that appear in this tree are alternate campaigns
that may be used on the order).

- We're going to assume that this is a residential campaign and therefore you would specify a highlight rule that returns
true if the customer's customer class is residential.

- Because this campaign has packages, we have indicated that the button that allows an order to be completed without
selecting a package is disabled. This means a user must choose one of the packages to complete the order.

- This campaign is setup so that the user will be transferred to Control Central - Account Info after the order is completed.
This is a subjective decision as you could transfer the user to a variety of transactions. It's just that the Account Info page
provides a nice confirmation of how the customer looks after the order has updated / created new information.

###### Packages Limited By Current State Of Service

Assume your organization has a campaign with several packages. Each package has the following restrictions in respect of
its use:

- "Package 1" can be offered to residential customers in California who have gas service, but don't have electric service.

- "Package 2" can be offered to residential customers in California who have electric service, but don't have gas service.

- "Package 3" can be offered to residential customers in California who have neither electric nor gas service.

The following diagram illustrates how such a campaign might look:


-----

The topics that follow describe the campaign and packages used to support this scenario. We'll start by explaining each
package. Then we'll describe how the campaign will be setup. This seems backwards, but it mirrors how you should design
this type of campaign:

- Has Gas / No Electricity Package

- Has Electricity / No Gas Package

- No Electricity / No Gas Package

**Has Gas / No Electricity Package**

The package that is offered to customers that currently have gas service, but don't have electricity service has the following
traits:

- It has eligibility rules that restrict its use to customers who meet the following criteria:

  - Customer has gas service

  - Customer doesn't have electricity service

- Refer to A Package With Service Type Comparisons for more information.

- We only need a single service agreement created if the package is selected and therefore there's just one entry in SAs To
Create. Please note the following about the information used to create this service agreement:

  - The SA Type is one that's used for an electric residential service agreement (hence the E-RES SA type).

  - The SA Type's Start Option is one that will setup the service agreement with the appropriate rate and contract
options.

  - The service agreement needs to be linked to an electric residential service point (hence the E-RES SP type).


-----

  - We've indicated a Start Algorithm of Start SP Service. Refer to STRM-VT for an example of such an algorithm
(type).

- We have not shown additional questions or miscellaneous fields in this package. This is because this package doesn't
have additional questions or additional fields.

**Has Electricity / No Gas Package**

The package that is offered to customers that currently have electric service, but don't have gas service has the following
traits:

- It has eligibility rules that restrict its use to customers who meet the following criteria:

  - Customer has electric service

  - Customer doesn't have gas service

- We only need a single service agreement created if the package is selected and therefore there's just one entry in SAs To
Create. Please note the following about the information used to create this service agreement:

  - The SA Type is one that's used for a gas residential service agreement (hence the G-RES SA type).

  - The SA Type's Start Option is one that will setup the service agreement with the appropriate rate and contract
options.

  - The service agreement needs to be linked to a gas residential service point (hence the G-RES SP type).

  - We've indicated a Start Algorithm of Start SP Service. Refer to STRM-VT for an example of such an algorithm
(type).

- We have not shown additional questions or miscellaneous fields in this package. This is because this package doesn't
have additional questions or additional fields.

**No Electricity / No Gas Package**

The package that is offered to customers that don't currently have electricity or gas service has the following traits:

- It has eligibility rules that restrict its use to customers who meet the following criteria:

  - Customer doesn't have electric service

  - Customer doesn't have gas service

- We need two service agreements created (one for electricity, one for gas).

- We have not shown additional questions or miscellaneous fields in this package. This is because this package doesn't
have additional questions or additional fields.

##### The Big Picture Of Package Eligibility Rules

The packages described under Examples of Campaigns and Packages have a variety of eligibility rules. Designing these
rules can be easy or time-consuming; it all depends on the complexity of your business rules. We'll walk you through
several examples to help you form an intuitive understanding of how to setup eligibility rules. Once you've acquired this
intuition you'll be ready to design the eligibility rules for your own packages.

**NOTE:**


-----

Don't confuse package eligibility rules with those associated with a campaign. Package eligibility rules control whether
a customer is allowed to choose a package on the order transaction. Campaign eligibility rules control whether a
campaign is highlighted on the "eligible campaigns" content zone and on an order's eligibility tree.

###### Criteria Groups versus Eligibility Criteria

Before we provide concrete examples of eligibility criteria, we need to explain two concepts: Criteria Groups and Eligibility
Criteria. A package's criteria groups control whether a customer is eligible to choose a package. At a high level, it works
like this:

- A criteria group has one or more eligibility criteria. A group's criteria control whether the group is considered TRUE or
FALSE for a given customer.

- When you create a group, you define what should happen if the group is TRUE or FALSE. You have the following
choices:

  - The customer is eligible to choose the package

  - The customer is not eligible to choose the package

  - The next group should be checked.

We'll use the following example to help illustrate these points. Assume a package exists that can only be selected if:

- The customer resides in California and their current retail supplier is company A, B or C

- OR, the customer resides in Nevada and their current retail supplier is company X, Y or A

This package requires two eligibility groups because it has two distinct conditions:

- IF (STATE = CALIFORNIA AND (SERVICE PROVIDER IN (A, B, C))

- IF (STATE = NEVADA AND (SERVICE PROVIDER IN (X, Y, A))

If either condition is true, then the customer is eligible for the package.

You'd need to setup the following criteria groups in order to support this requirement:


Group

No.


Group Description If Group is TRUE If Group is FALSE


1 Customer resides in California

and their current retail supplier is

company A, B or C


Eligible Check next group


-----

2 Customer resides in Nevada

and their current retail supplier is

company X, Y or A


Eligible Ineligible


The following criteria will be required for each of the above groups:

Group 1: Customer resides in California and their current retail supplier is company A, B or C


Seq Logical Criteria If Eligibility Criteria is

TRUE


If Eligibility Criteria is

FALSE


If Insufficient Data


10 State = California Check next condition Group is false Group is false


20 Electric retail supplier in

(A, B, C)


Group is true Group is false Group is false


Group 2: Customer resides in Nevada and their current retail supplier is company X, Y or A


Seq Logical Criteria If Eligibility Criteria is

TRUE


If Eligibility Criteria is

FALSE


If Insufficient Data


10 State = Nevada Check next condition Group is false Group is false


20 Electric retail supplier in

(X, Y, A)


Group is true Group is false Group is false


The next section describes how you'd setup the specific logical criteria in each of the groups.

###### Defining Logical Criteria

When you setup an eligibility criterion, you must define two things:

- The field to be compared

- The comparison method

You have the following choices in respect of identifying the field to be compared:

- You can choose one of the miscellaneous fields on the order (keep in mind that miscellaneous fields also hold the
answers to any questions posed on the order).

- You can execute an algorithm to retrieve a field value from someplace else in the system. This is a very powerful feature,
but it's not terribly intuitive. We'll present a few examples later in this section to illustrate the power of this approach.

You have the following choices in respect of identifying the comparison method:

- You can choose an operator (e.g., >, <, =, BETWEEN, IN, etc.) and a comparison value.

- You can execute an algorithm whose job it will be to perform the comparison (and return TRUE, FALSE or
INSUFFICIENT DATA). This is also a very powerful feature, but it's not terribly intuitive. We'll present a few examples
later in this section to illustrate the power of this approach.

The Examples Of Package Eligibility Rules provide numerous examples to help you understand this design.

###### Examples Of Package Eligibility Rules

The topics in this section provide examples about how to setup package eligibility rules.


-----

###### A Package That Is Always Eligible

If a package is always eligible, it still needs an eligibility group. Good examples of such packages are shown under
An Easier Way To Create One Time Charges. A package that is always eligible would require the following eligibility
information:


Group

No.


Group Description If Group is TRUE If Group is FALSE


1 Always eligible Eligible Eligible

The following criteria will be required for this group:

Group 1: Always eligible

Seq Field to Compare Comparison Method If TRUE If FALSE If Insufficient Data


10 Algorithm: retrieve

order's account


Algorithm: Always

true


Group is true Group is true Group is true


This group's criterion is odd in that it's not comparing anything. In order to setup this criterion, you have to use the
following "trick":

- Field to Compare. You can pick any miscellaneous field on the campaign. If the campaign has no miscellaneous fields,
you'll need to setup an algorithm to retrieve a field from the order (refer to PKEL-ENRFLD for an example of this type
of algorithm). In the above example, we used an algorithm to retrieve the order's account.

- Comparison Method. We chose a comparison algorithm that always returns a value of TRUE (refer to PKCC-DEFAULT
for an example of this type of algorithm).

- You'll notice that if a value of TRUE is returned, the Group is true (and we've setup the group to indicate a true group
means the customer is eligible for the package).

We understand this is a little complicated, but this design provides the power necessary to support very complex criteria.
The following sections provide more examples to help you form a better understanding of these concepts.

###### A Package With A Time Span Comparison

The Senior Citizen Package has the following eligibility rules:

- Customer class = Residential

- Division = California

- Birth date equates to that of a senior citizen

These rules require only one eligibility group on the package. It would look as follows:


Group

No.


Group Description If Group is TRUE If Group is FALSE


1 Residential, Calif, Senior Eligible Ineligible

The following criteria will be required for this group:

Group 1: Residential, Calif, Senior


-----

Seq Field to Compare Comparison Method If TRUE If FALSE If Insufficient Data


10 Algorithm: retrieve

order's customer

class

20 Algorithm: retrieve

order's division

30 Misc Field On Order:

Date of Birth


= R Check next condition Group is false Group is false

= CA Check next condition Group is false Group is false


Algorithm: True if

senior


Group is true Group is false Group is false


The first two criteria are easy; they simply retrieve a field on the order and compare it to a given value. If the comparison
doesn't result in a TRUE value, the Group is false (and, the group indicates that if the group is false, the customer isn't
eligible for the package). If the comparison results in a TRUE value, the next condition is checked.

The last criterion contains a time span comparison. Time span comparisons are used to compare a date to something. In
our example, we have to determine the age of the customer based on their birth date. If the resultant age is > 65, they are
considered to be a senior citizen. To pull this off, you can take advantage of a comparison algorithm supplied with the base
package as described below.

- Field to Compare. The miscellaneous field in which the customer's birth date is held is selected.

- Comparison Method. We chose a comparison algorithm that returns a value of TRUE if the related field value (the
customer's date of birth) is greater than 65 years (refer to PKCC-TIMESPN for an example of this type of algorithm).

You'll notice that if a value of TRUE is returned by the True if senior algorithm, the group is true (and we've setup the
group to indicate a true group means the customer is eligible).

**NOTE:**
**The time span algorithm can be used to compare days, weeks, months, etc. Refer to PKCC-TIMESPN for more**
information about this algorithm.

###### A Package With Service Type Comparison

The Has Gas / No Electricity Package has the following eligibility rules:

- Customer has gas service

- Customer doesn't have electricity service

These rules require only one eligibility group on the package. It would looks as follows:


Group

No.


Group Description If Group is TRUE If Group is FALSE


1 Has Gas, Doesn't Have Electricity Eligible Ineligible

The following criteria will be required for this group:

Group 1: Has Gas, Doesn't Have Electricity

Seq Field to Compare Comparison Method If TRUE If FALSE If Insufficient Data


10 Algorithm: check if

customer has gas

service


= TRUE Check next condition Group is false Group is false


-----

20 Algorithm: check if

customer has electric

service


= TRUE Group is false Group is true Group is false


Both criteria are similar - they check if the customer has a given type of service and act accordingly. We used a "field to
compare" algorithm to pull this off, but this algorithm is a bit counter intuitive (but understanding it will provide you with
another way to implement complex eligibility criteria):

- Field to Compare. We chose a "field to compare" algorithm that checks if an account has service agreements that belong
to a given set of service types. It returns a value of TRUE if the customer has an active service agreement that matches
one of the service types in the algorithm. In our example, the "check if customer has gas service" algorithm returns a
value of TRUE if the customer has at least one active service agreement whose SA type references the gas service type.
The "check if customer has electric service" algorithm is almost identical, only the service type differs. Refer to PKELSVCTYP for an example of this type of algorithm.

- Comparison Method. We simply compare the value returned by the algorithm to TRUE and indicate the appropriate
response.

**NOTE:**
**Bottom line. The "field to compare" algorithm isn't actually returning a specific field's value. Rather, it's returning a**
value of TRUE or FALS (this is not a misspelling). This value is, in turn, compared by the "comparison method" and the
group is set to true, false or check next accordingly.

###### A Package With More Complex Operators

One of the eligibility groups described under Criteria Groups versus Eligibility Criteria has the following eligibility rules:

- Customer must live in California

- Service provider is A, B or C

The eligibility group in which these rules would be defined looks as follows:


Group

No.


Group Description If Group is TRUE If Group is FALSE


1 Lives in California, current service

provider is either retailer A, B or

C

The following criteria will be required for this group:


Eligible Ineligible


Group 1: Lives in California, current service provider is either retailer A, B or C

Seq Field to Compare Comparison Method If TRUE If FALSE If Insufficient Data


10 Algorithm: retrieve

order's state

20 Misc Field On Order:

Current electric

supplier


= CA Check next condition Group is false Group is false

IN A, B, C Group is true Group is false Group is false


This example is very simple. The only thing worth pointing out is that a number of operators can be used when you define a
"comparison method". Refer to Package - Eligibility for the complete list of operators.


-----

##### The Big Picture Of Campaign Eligibility Rules

In the previous section, we explained how to Design Eligibility Rules For A Package. In this section, we explain how to
design eligibility rules for a campaign.

A campaign's eligibility rules control two things:

- Whether the campaign appears in the Eligible Campaigns content zone. This content zone suggests possible campaigns
for the current customer displayed on control central. You might want to use this zone if you have different campaigns
that are offered to different types of customers. Refer to Real-time Marketing of Additional Services to a Customer for an
example of how this content zone can be used to "up sell" additional services.

- Whether the campaign appears on an order's eligibility tree. Campaigns that appear in this tree are alternate campaigns
that may be used on the order. Refer to Real-time Marketing of Services to a Prospect for an example of how an order's
eligibility tree can contain alternate campaigns for an order.

Designing these criteria can be easy or time-consuming; it all depends on the complexity of your business rules. We'll walk
you through several examples to help you form an intuitive understanding of how to setup campaign eligibility rules. Once
you've acquired this intuition you'll be ready to design the eligibility rules for your own packages.

**NOTE:**
Don't confuse eligibility rules for a package with those associated with a campaign. Package eligibility rules control
whether a customer is allowed to choose a package. Campaign eligibility rules control whether a campaign is
highlighted on the Eligible Campaigns content zone and on an order's eligibility tree.

###### Campaign Eligibility Rules Are Not Strictly Enforced

While the system prevents ineligible packages from being selected for an order (based on the package's eligibility rules), the
system does not strictly enforce a campaign's eligibility rules. In other words, a user can change the campaign on an order to
any active campaign. This "laxness" is intentional; otherwise it could become impossible to change an order's campaign.

It might be more helpful to think of campaign eligibility rules as "highlight conditions". These "highlight conditions" simply
control whether the campaign appears in the Eligible Campaigns content zone and on an order's eligibility tree.

###### Campaign Eligibility Rules Are Defined Using Algorithms

You define a campaign's eligibility rules using one or more algorithms on the campaign. These algorithms are relatively
straightforward as they simply return one of the following values:

- Eligible. Meaning the customer is eligible for the campaign.

- Ineligible. Meaning the customer is not eligible for the campaign

- Check Next Algorithm. Meaning that the next algorithm should be checked. You'd only design an algorithm to return
such a value if multiple algorithms are used to determine a customer's eligibility for a campaign.

**NOTE:**
**Bottom line. A customer is eligible for a campaign if at least one of its eligibility algorithms returns a value of**
"eligible".

The Examples Of Campaign Eligibility Rules provide numerous examples to help you understand this design.


-----

###### Examples Of Campaign Eligibility Rules

The topics in this section provide examples about how to setup campaign eligibility rules.

###### A Campaign That Is Always Eligible

If a campaign is always eligible, it would require a simple eligibility algorithm that returns an indication that it is always
eligible. A good example of such a campaign is shown under An Easier Way To Create One Time Charges. Refer to CAELDEFAULT for an example of this type of eligibility algorithm.

###### A Campaign That Is Never Eligible

If a campaign is never eligible, it would require a simple eligibility algorithm that returns an indication that it is ineligible. A
good example of such a campaign is shown under Prelude To Start/Stop. Refer to CAEL-DEFAULT for an example of this
type of eligibility algorithm.

###### A Campaign For Residential Customers

If a campaign should only be targeted at residential customers, it would require a simple eligibility algorithm that returns
an indication of eligible if the customer's customer class is residential. A good example of such a campaign is shown under
Marketing Surveys. Refer to CAEL-CC for an example of this type of eligibility algorithm.

###### A Campaign For California, Residential Customers

If a campaign should only be targeted at residential customers in California, it would require two eligibility algorithms:

Algorithm No Algorithm Example Algorithm


1 Indicate Check Next Algorithm if customer

class is "residential"


Refer to CAEL-CC for an example of this type

of eligibility algorithm.


2 Indicate Eligible if division is "California" Refer to CAEL-DIV for an example of this type

of eligibility algorithm.

##### Designing Campaigns and Packages

Designing campaigns and packages can be simple or challenging. Factors that will influence the complexity of the design
process include:

- Whether the type of goods and services marketed to your customers / prospects differs depending on some trait of the
customer or the region in which they are located. For example,


-----

  - Your company may have very straightforward packages that only differ based on whether the customer is industrial,
residential or commercial. If this describes your company, the setup process will be simple.

  - Alternatively, your company might offer different packages to residential customers based on whether they pay
automatically, whether they are a senior citizen, whether they purchases multiple services from you, etc. If this
describes your company, then you'll have to define the various eligibility criteria and the respective packages
applicable to customers who satisfy each criterion.

- Whether premises exist prior to order taking. For example, a company that distributes a commodity has a well-defined
geographic area and therefore new premises typically don't arise when orders are taken.

- Whether your company offers many different types of goods and services.

- Whether your rates have charges / discounts that are only applied to some customers. For example, you might have
discounts that are applied if the customer is a senior citizen or an employee.

- Which of the Supported Business Processes you implement.

The topics in this section provide a structured approach to design your campaigns and packages.

###### Determine The Place Of Start/Stop

Before you can design your campaigns and packages, you must determine if your organization will use start / stop to initiate
new service agreements or whether new service can be initiated using the order transaction. Refer to Order versus Start /
Stop for information to help you make this decision.

If you decide to use start / stop to initiate service, we'd recommend creating the following types of campaigns:

- Create a campaign similar to that described under Prelude to Start / Stop.

- If you levy one-time charges, you may also want to create a campaign similar to that described under An Easier Way To
Create One Time Charges.

- If your organization performs marketing surveys, you may also want to create a campaign similar to that described under
Marketing Surveys.

If you decide to use the order transaction to initiate new service, follow the steps outlined in the following sections. Note
that we use the example described under Packages Limited By Answers And Field Values when describing the design
process.

###### Determine Which Types Of Service Agreements Are Created

**WARNING:**
We have assumed that you have already designed your organization's SP types, SA types, start options and rates. If you
have not yet done this, we recommend familiarizing yourself with the concepts described in Designing SP Types, Rates
and Defining Service Agreement Types before designing your campaigns and packages.

Start off by determining the different types of service agreements that can be created if a package is selected. In our
example campaign, only one SA type is used - E-RES (electric residential service).

###### Determine The Different Start Options That Exist For Each Type Of Service Agreement


-----

After you know which SA types are going to be created, determine the potential start options that can be used for each SA
type. In our example campaign, several start options are possible for the E-RES (electric residential service):

SA Type Start Option

E-RES Senior

E-RES Single-Elec Heat

E-RES Single-Gas Heat

E-RES Multi-Family

###### Determine The SP Type (if any) For Each Service Agreement

The SA types and start options control how the service agreement will look (i.e., they control the rate, contract riders,
characteristics, interval profiles, time-of-use maps, etc. defaulted onto new service agreements created when a package is
selected). During this step, you define the SP type of the service point that will be linked to the service agreement. If several
different types of SP types can be used for a service agreement, you'll have to choose one as this is the type of service point
that will be created when the service agreement is created. If you plan to allow the package to be used to start service at an
existing premise (and you don't want the system to create new service points), you will have to develop new plug-ins. Please
speak to your implementation group if you need more information.

In our example campaign, only one SP type is created (or reused if the premise already has a service point of this type) - ERES (electric residential service point):

SA Type Start Option SP Type

E-RES Senior E-RES

E-RES Single-Elec Heat E-RES

E-RES Single-Gas Heat E-RES

E-RES Multi-Family E-RES

**NOTE:**
**Many service agreements don't need SP types. For service agreements that don't use service points (e.g., deposit**
service agreements, charitable contributions, one-time charges, etc.), you don't have to reference a SP type.

###### Determine The Method Used To Create Each Service Agreement

For each SA Type / Start Option / SP Type combination, determine the algorithm that will be used to create the service
agreement and the service point. The base package is supplied with a limited number of such algorithm types (refer to
STRM-AS and STRM-VT for examples).

SA Type Start Option SP Type Start Method

E-RES Senior E-RES Algorithm: Create new service

agreement and stop old service

agreement if active SA with the

same service type exists

E-RES Single-Elec Heat E-RES Algorithm: Create new service

agreement and stop old service


-----

agreement if active SA with the

same service type exists

E-RES Single-Gas Heat E-RES Algorithm: Create new service

agreement and stop old service

agreement if active SA with the

same service type exists

E-RES Multi-Family E-RES Algorithm: Create new service

agreement and stop old service

agreement if active SA with the

same service type exists

###### Extract Algorithms From The Start Method

The start methods illustrated above all require the same algorithm:

Algorithm Type Algorithm Parameter Values

Create SP and create SA (see STRM-VT) Always create new SA and stop existing SA 2 (stop existing service)

###### Determine Which Combinations Can Be Grouped Under A Package

Now you determine which combinations of service agreements can be offered to a customer as a package. In our example
campaign, a customer can only choose one type of service agreement (i.e., each entry in our table is mutually exclusive).
This means that each entry is a separate package:

Package SA Type Start Option SP Type Algorithm

1 E-RES Senior E-RES STRM-VT (Switch Option)

2 E-RES Single-Elec Heat E-RES STRM-VT (Switch Option)

3 E-RES Single-Gas Heat E-RES STRM-VT (Switch Option)

4 E-RES Multi-Family E-RES STRM-VT (Switch Option)

**FASTPATH:**
Refer to Packages Limited By Current State Of Service for an example of a package that has multiple service
agreements.

###### Determine Package Eligibility Rules

The topics in this section describe the eligibility rules for each package in our example campaign.

**NOTE:**
**Assumption. This section assumes you are comfortable with the information in The Big Picture Of Package Eligibility.**


-----

###### Eligibility Rules For Package 1

Package 1 (the senior package) in our example campaign has the following eligibility rules:

- Customer class = Residential

- Division = California

- Birth date equates to that of a senior citizen

These rules require only one eligibility group on the package. It would looks as follows:


Group

No.


Group Description If Group is TRUE If Group is FALSE


1 Residential, Calif, Senior Eligible Ineligible

The following criteria will be required for this group:

Group 1: Residential, Calif, Senior

Seq Field to Compare Comparison Method If TRUE If FALSE If Insufficient Data

- Customer class = Residential

- Division = California

- Birth date does not equate to that of a senior citizen

- Lives in a single-family home

- House is heated with electricity

These rules require only one eligibility group on the package. It would looks as follows:


Group

No.

###### Eligibility Rules For Package 3

Package 3 (the single-family / gas heat package) in our example campaign has the following eligibility rules:

- Customer class = Residential

- Division = California

- Birth date does not equate to that of a senior citizen

- Lives in a single-family home

- House is heated with gas

These rules require only one eligibility group on the package. It would looks as follows:


Group

No.


Group Description If Group is TRUE If Group is FALSE


1 Residential, Calif, Non Senior,

Single Family, Gas Heat

The following criteria will be required for this group:

Group 1: Residential, Calif, Non Senior, Single Family, Gas Heat

###### Eligibility Rules For Package 4

Package 4 (the multi-family package) in our example campaign has the following eligibility rules:

- Customer class = Residential

- Division = California

- Birth date does not equate to that of a senior citizen

- Lives in a multi-family home

These rules require only one eligibility group on the package. It would looks as follows:


Group

No.


Group Description If Group is TRUE If Group is FALSE


1 Residential, Calif, Non Senior,

Multi Family

The following criteria will be required for this group:

Group 1: Residential, Calif, Non Senior, Single Family, Gas Heat

Group is false Check next condition Group is false

Group is true Group is false Group is false


###### Extract Algorithms From The Eligibility Rules

The eligibility rules illustrated above require the following algorithms:

Algorithm Type Algorithm Parameter Values


Retrieve a field from the order for eligibility

Retrieve Order's Customer Class Field name: CUST_CL_CD

Retrieve Order's Division Field name: CIS_DIVISION


Time span comparison (see PKCC-TIMESPN) Determine if birth date equates to that of a

senior


Time span type: YEAR

Operator: >=


-----

Comparison Value: 65

###### Extract Miscellaneous Fields From The Eligibility Rules

During this step, you extract miscellaneous fields that must be captured on the order in order drive your eligibility rules.

Misc. Field Where Stored Why Is It Needed

Date of birth Person characteristic Numerous eligibility rules use this field to

determine if a customer is a senior citizen

Type of Residence Premise characteristic Numerous eligibility rules use this field to

qualify a customer for a package

Type of Heat Premise characteristic Numerous eligibility rules use this field to

qualify a customer for a package

**NOTE:**
**Fields explicitly referenced on every order. You'll notice that we didn't list those fields referenced in the eligibility**
rules that are explicitly referenced on every order (e.g., customer class, state, division, etc.). This is because these types
of fields come "for free".

###### Determine Additional Information That Is Required If A Package Is Selected

During this step, you determine if there's any information that needs to be created when a package is selected that can't be
defaulted from its start option. In our example campaign, package 4 (the Multi-Family Home package), also needs to know
the number of housing units at the premise (this information is probably needed to calculate a specific charge in the rate).
None of the other packages require additional information. The extra field has been appended to our miscellaneous field
table.

Misc. Field Where Stored Why Is It Needed

Date of birth Person characteristic Numerous eligibility rules use this field to

determine if a customer is a senior citizen

Type of Residence Premise characteristic Numerous eligibility rules use this field to

qualify a customer for a package

Type of Heat Premise characteristic Numerous eligibility rules use this field to

qualify a customer for a package

Number of Units in House Premise characteristic The electric SA created by package 4 requires

the number of units when it calculates the

ongoing bill segments

###### Determine If There Are Additional Questions / Fields For Your Packages


-----

Our example campaign indicates that all customers are encouraged to pay automatically. In order to pay automatically
several fields are required (Start Date, End Date, Autopay Source (i.e., bank / credit card), Account Number, Account
Name, Expiration Date). These fields are not "explicitly referenced" on the order and therefore must be captured as
miscellaneous fields. We have appended these fields to our list of miscellaneous fields:

Misc. Field Where Stored Why Is It Needed

Date of birth Person characteristic Numerous eligibility rules use this field to

determine if a customer is a senior citizen

Type of Residence Premise characteristic Numerous eligibility rules use this field to

qualify a customer for a package

Type of Heat Premise characteristic Numerous eligibility rules use this field to

qualify a customer for a package

Number of Units in House Premise characteristic The electric SA created by package 4 requires

the number of units when it calculates the

ongoing bill segments

Auto Pay Start Date Account / Autopay Start Date Column Used if a customer pays automatically

Auto Pay End Date Account / Autopay End Date Column Used if a customer pays automatically

Auto Pay Source Account / Autopay Source Used if a customer pays automatically

Auto Pay Account Number Account / Autopay Account ID Used if a customer pays automatically

Auto Pay Account Name Account / Autopay Account Name Used if a customer pays automatically

Auto Pay Account Expiration Date Account / Autopay Account Expiration Date Used if a customer pays automatically

We're going to assume that we don't capture any additional marketing-oriented questions. If we did, we'd need additional
fields to hold the response to each question.

###### Determine If Additional Instructions Should Be Shown

If a package is selected, you can present additional instructions to the user informing them of special tasks they should
perform (or special instructions they should give to the customer). For example, you could instruct the user to inform
customers who aren't senior citizens that they should call back if they become seniors as they may qualify for a better rate.
These instructions can be defined on each package.

For the sake of brevity, we will assume no additional instructions are necessary when a package is selected.

###### Determine If There Are Campaign-Level Fields / Questions

Next, you determine if there are additional fields that need to be captured regardless of the package that's selected. For
example, you may want to capture additional demographic or geographic information for marketing purposes.

While our example campaign has no such requirement, for illustration purposes we'll assume you ask the customer to rate
the quality of service they have experienced (assuming they are a current customer). This additional question requires
another entry in our list of miscellaneous fields.

Misc. Field Where Stored Why Is It Needed

Date of birth Person characteristic Numerous eligibility rules use this field to

determine if a customer is a senior citizen


-----

Type of Residence Premise characteristic Numerous eligibility rules use this field to

qualify a customer for a package

Auto Pay Account Name Account / Autopay Account Name Used if a customer pays automatically

Auto Pay Account Expiration Date Account / Autopay Account Expiration Date Used if a customer pays automatically

Service Rating Person characteristic Campaign level marketing question

###### Determine The Properties Of Every Miscellaneous Field

At this point, you have amalgamated all miscellaneous fields required for the campaign and its packages. Now you have to
define the following for each field:

- Prompt On Order. This is the prompt that will prefix the field when the order is taken. The following table provides
examples.

- Campaign Applicability. This controls whether the field is optional, required, or only applicable on package(s).

  - A value of required means the order taker must enter a valid value before packages are displayed for selection.

  - A value of optional means the order taker can leave the field blank prior to package selection. You can make an
optional field required on individual packages. For example, you would probably make Date of birth required on the
Senior package.

  - A value of only applicable on packages is used for fields that are only captured for specific packages. Fields of this
type are suppressed prior to package selection. When you setup a package, you indicate if the field is applicable (if so,
the user is only prompted for the field if the package is selected).

- Type Of Response. This controls where the field is stored when the order is completed and how it is validated. You have
two options: characteristic or column.

  - If a field is a Characteristic, you must define which entity the characteristic value is to be stored on when the order is
completed ( Person, Account, Premise or Order ). You must also define the Characteristic Type as this controls the
characteristic value entered by the user.

  - If a field's value resides is a column (as opposed to a characteristic value), you must define the column reference. A
field's column reference controls three things:

- How the field's value is retrieved. A field's value is retrieved when an existing person / account / premise is referenced on
an order.

- How the field's value is validated. A field's value is validated before package eligibility is determined and before the
order is completed.

- How the field's value is posted (i.e., updated on the database). A field's value is posted when an order is completed.

**FASTPATH:**

Refer to Extract Column References From Miscellaneous Fields for more information about column references.

- Default Value On Order. This controls whether the order taker is supplied with a default value when an order is created.
Note well: for optional and only applicable on package fields, you can specify a different default value on each package.

There are three types of algorithms referenced in the above table:

- Retrieval algorithm. A column's retrieval algorithm retrieves the column's current value from the database. You'll notice
that only one of our columns uses a retrieval algorithm. This is because we've used a sophisticated example of a group of
columns that are retrieved at the same time. When you have such a group of columns, nominate one of the columns to do
the retrieval work and specify the retrieval algorithm on it.

- Validation algorithm. A column's validation algorithm validates the column's value prior to the database being updated.
You'll notice that only one of our columns uses a validation algorithm. This is because we've used a sophisticated
example of a group of columns that are validated as a group. When you have such a group of columns, nominate one of
the columns to do the validation work and specify the validation algorithm on it.

- Post algorithm. A column's post algorithm updates the column's value on the database when the order is completed.
You'll notice that only one of our columns uses a post algorithm. This is because we've used a sophisticated example of a
group of columns that are posted together. When you have such a group of columns, nominate one of the columns to do
the posting work and specify the posting algorithm on it.

Notice that we have indicated that one of the columns has a "foreign key reference". You declare a "foreign key reference"
if the valid values for a column are defined on another table in the system (this also affects the order user interface as a
dropdown appears for columns that have foreign key references). In our example, Auto Pay Source is the only column
whose valid values are defined on the automatic payment source control table.

###### Extract Algorithms From The Column References

The column references illustrated above require the following algorithms:

###### Determine Account / Premise Dependency For Each Column Reference

Later in the design process (see Determine How The Campaign Behaves), you define on the campaign whether an account
(and premise) is required, optional or not allowed on its orders. Your selection impacts how you setup column references.
This is a little complicated so let's use an example:

- Assume you've setup a campaign to indicate a premise can optionally be defined on its orders.

- If the order-taker doesn't define a premise on an order, any premise-oriented questions and miscellaneous fields (Q&MF)
should be suppressed on the order.

- It's easy for the system to know which Q&MFs to suppress when a Q&MF's response is held in a characteristic (because
you must define on the campaign if the response will reside in an account, premise, person or order characteristic). For
column reference Q&MFs, the system doesn't know if the response is account-oriented, premise-oriented or neither
because algorithms handle the validation / updating of the response.

- Therefore, when you use column references on a campaigns Q&MFs, you must define if the responses are accountoriented or premise-oriented (so that the system can suppress the Q&MF when the user doesn't enter an account or
premise on the order).

The following table contains the column references defined above as well as their dependency

Column Reference Question Dependency

Auto Pay Start Date Must have account

Auto Pay End Date Must have account

Auto Pay Source Must have account

Auto Pay Account Number Must have account

Auto Pay Account Name Must have account


-----

Auto Pay Expiration Date Must have account

You'll notice that each column reference is account-oriented (this is because automatic payment fields are stored on the
respective account).

###### Determine If Any Properties Are Overridden On Any Package

At this point, you have defined the properties of all miscellaneous fields at the campaign level. You now need to determine
if any of your packages need to override any of these properties. In general, you can only override miscellaneous fields
whose campaign applicability is optional or only applicable on package(s).

Our example campaign has only two overrides:

Package 1 requires the following miscellaneous field overrides:


Misc. Field Override Prompt (seen if a

package is selected)


Override Package Applicability Override Default Value


Date of birth Not overridden Required Not overridden

Package 4 requires the following miscellaneous field overrides:


Misc. Field Override Prompt (seen if a

package is selected)


Override Package Applicability Override Default Value


Number of Units in House Not overridden Required 2

**WARNING:**
If you override field properties on a campaign's packages, you will not be able to change the properties of the field at the
campaign level.

###### Determine The Eligibility Rules For The Campaign

**NOTE:**
**Assumption. This section assumes you are comfortable with the information in The Big Picture Of Campaign**
Eligibility.

The easiest way to determine a campaign's eligibility is to examine each package's eligibility criteria and abstract common
eligibility restrictions onto the campaign. It's important to remember that campaign-level eligibility is only used to highlight
if the campaign MAY contain applicable packages; campaign-level eligibility is not strictly enforced.

The packages on our example campaign are all targeted at residential customers in California. Therefore we'll take
advantage of two base package algorithms to construct the campaign's eligibility criteria.

Algorithm Type Algorithm Parameter Values


Check if account's customer class is in a

predefined list (see CAEL-CC)


If customer class is "residential", check next

algorithm


If customer's customer class is in list: 30

(check next)

If customer's customer class is not in list: 20

(ineligible)


-----

Check if account's division is in a predefined

list (see CAEL-DIV)


List of customer classes: R

If division is "California", customer is eligible If customer's CIS division is in list: 10 (eligible)

If customer's CIS division is not in list: 20

(ineligible)

List of customer classes: CA


###### Determine How The Campaign Behaves

The final step before you're ready to setup the campaign involves defining a variety of behavioral functions as described
below:

- You need to define how the campaign uses accounts and premises. Specifically, on a campaign you define if an account /
premise is required / optional / not allowed on its orders. In addition, if an account / premise is required or optional,
you can control whether new accounts / premises can be created when an order is completed (the alternative is to force
each order to use an existing account / premise). These controls prevent the unwanted proliferation of new accounts and
premises for campaigns that are targeted at existing accounts and premises.

- Many fields on an order (e.g., phone type, customer class, division, account management group) can be defaulted on
orders created for new customers. You will see these fields on Order - Main. Think about each such field and whether a
default value is appropriate. Keep in mind that the order taker can override any of these default values.

- An order taker can indicate that they want to hold an order if they need to do further research before continuing with an
order. A background process (TD-ECBK) will create a To Do entry for held orders as a reminder to get back in touch
with the customer on a future date. You can define the default To Do role assigned to such To Do entries when you
create a campaign. Keep in mind that this value can be overridden when the order taker holds an order.

- You can indicate on a campaign the transaction to which the user should be transferred when orders are completed. Refer
to Supported Business Processes for examples of how you might want to use this field.

###### Setup Sequence

And now you're ready to set up your campaign. The following points describe the order in which this should be done:

**WARNING:**
We have assumed that you have already designed your organization's SP types, SA types, start options and rates. If you
have not yet done this, we recommend familiarizing yourself with the concepts described in Designing SP Types, Rates
and Defining Service Agreement Types before designing your campaigns and packages.

- Setup any new column references required by the campaign's miscellaneous fields. You will have to leave the retrieve,
validate and post algorithms blank until after the next step.

- Setup any new algorithms required by:

  - The packages' eligibility rules.

  - The packages' start methods.

  - The campaign's eligibility rules.

  - The campaign's column references.

- Update the relevant column references with the appropriate retrieve, validate and post algorithms.

- Setup any new characteristic types required by the campaign's miscellaneous fields.


-----

- Create the campaign using the information you designed above. Specifically:

  - You defined the question and miscellaneous fields under Determine The Properties Of Every Miscellaneous Field.

  - You defined the eligibility rules under Determine The Eligibility Rules For The Campaign.

  - You defined everything else under Determine How The Campaign Behaves.

  - We recommend leaving the campaign's status as Inactive until all packages are entered.

- Create the campaign's packages using the information you designed above. Specifically:

  - You defined the question and miscellaneous field overrides under Determine If Any Properties Are Overridden On A
Package.

  - You defined the eligibility rules under Determine Package Eligibility Rules.

  - You defined the instructions under Determine If Additional Instructions Are Required.

- Change the campaign's status to Active.

**NOTE:**
**The default campaign on the installation record. If the campaign you've setup is the "default" campaign used when a**
user presses the Add Order button on Control Central, make sure to specify it as the default campaign on the installation
record. Refer to Setting up a New Customer Prior To Starting Service for more information.

##### Other Useful Information

The topics in this section contain miscellaneous information about the sales & marketing functions.

###### Order versus Start/Stop

There are two different ways to start service for a customer:

- As described under definitions, you can use the order transaction to start service.

- Alternatively, you can use start / stop.

The following table provides insight into the pros and cons of each method (after this table you will find our
recommendations):

Issue Order Start/Stop


New customer setup Information about the new customer can be

entered on the order page. A person / account

will be setup when the order is completed.

New premise setup Information about the new premise can be

entered on the order page. A premise (and

service points) will be setup when the order is

completed.

Updates to existing customer information Changes to a customer's existing account

and/or person info may be entered on the

order page. The related person and/or

account will be updated when the order is

completed.


A new person and account must be setup

prior to using Start/Stop. See How To Add A

New Customer From Control Central for more

information.

A new premise and service point(s) must be

setup prior to using Start/Stop.

Start/Stop cannot be used to update person

or account information. Rather, you must

transfer to the person or account page and

make the necessary changes.


-----

Incomplete orders The order transaction allows you to record

customer information and hold it without

starting service. The customer can call back in

the future and you can continue where you left

off.

Stop current service, start new service The order transaction does not currently

provide a mechanism for stopping service (it

can only be used to start service).


Automatic versus manual start option

selection (start options are used to default

a great deal of information onto a service

agreement)

Starting premise and non-premise oriented

services


If a customer selects a package, the system

creates service agreements using the start

options defined in the package (i.e., you do

not have to select a start option for each

service agreement that's created).

If a customer selects a package, the system

can create both premise and non-premise

oriented service agreements. For example,

when a package is selected, the system can

create electric, gas, deposit, and charitable

contribution SAs (based on the information

defined on the package).


Changes after completion An order cannot be modified after it is

completed. Any changes (cancellations prior

to starting service, changes of the start date,

etc.) must be performed using the start/stop

transaction.

Field activity visibility After an order is completed, the user is

transferred to control central where field

activities associated with the premise can be

seen in trees and context zones.

Address changes Address changes entered on the order

transaction are applied when an order is

completed (i.e., when a package is selected).

They are not held awaiting service agreement

activation.

Based on the above, we'd recommend the following:


You cannot leave a start half-finished - you

either have to complete the start or cancel it.

Start/Stop can be used to stop a customer's

current service and start new service.

When you start service, you must define

the specific start option for each service

agreement created (actually, you only have to

do this for those types of service agreements

that use start options).

Multiple premise-oriented service agreements

can be created in one interaction. However, a

separate interaction is required for each non
premise oriented service agreement.

The start/stop transaction allows you to cancel

and make changes to pending start service

agreements.

All field activities associated with all premises

associated with all pending starts / stops are

shown on the start / stop transaction.

When you enter an address change on the

start / stop transaction, this address changed

is saved until the first pending start or stop

is activated. This means that the address

change is effectively held until the start/stop is

activated.



- If your organization has well-defined service locations (i.e., premises) AND a premise's service point type controls the
types of services offered to the customer, you should probably only use the order transaction to setup new customer
information. The new service agreements should be setup using start / stop. See Prelude To Start/Stop for more
information.

- In all other situations, we'd recommend using the order transaction to start service. If customers typically stop and start
service in tandem, we'd recommend the following steps:

  - Stop the customer’s existing service using start / stop.

  - Return to Control Central - Account Info and select the appropriate campaign from the appropriate portal zone. Keep
in mind that the portal zones displayed on this page are based on the user's preferences and security profile. Therefore
this zone may not be available to all users.

  - When you select the appropriate campaign, you'll be transferred to the order transaction where you can start the
desired package for the customer.


-----

###### Orders Cannot Be Changed After They Are Completed

The Lifecycle of an Order indicates that once an order is complete, it cannot become pending again. In addition to this rule,
we'd like to stress that once an order is complete, you cannot make any changes to the order except to add new log entries.

###### Premise and SP Characteristics May Be Populated From Postal Defaults

If you specify a new premise on the order transaction and you complete the order, a new premise will be created. This
premise's characteristics can be populated from two different sources:

- You could have designed the campaign to have its orders capture premise characteristics. You do this by adding
miscellaneous fields to the campaign that are premise characteristics.

- You could have set up postal defaults for the premise's country and postal code.

If a given characteristic is referenced on both of the above, the characteristic value on the campaign is used as the premise's
characteristic value.

As described above, service points may be created when a package is selected (it depends on the SA to Create algorithm
that you've used on the selected package). The base package algorithms that create a new service point when a package is
selected will populate the service point's characteristics using the information on the postal defaults (if specified). Refer to
STRM-VT for an example of this type of SA to create algorithm.

###### To Do List Processing

In the base package, there are two To Do lists that may be affected by orders:

- Highlight pending orders. This To Do list contains orders that are in the pending state. Refer to Pending To Do Entries
(TD-EPND) for more information about this To Do list.

- Highlight held orders. This To Do list contains orders that are in the held state. Refer to Held To Do Entries (TD-ECBK)
for more information about this To Do list. Refer to Order - Hold Dialog for more information about holding orders.

###### Hold and Cancel Reason Codes

In Lifecycle of an Order, we illustrated how a user can hold a pending order. Before a user can hold an order, they must
supply an Order Hold Reason.

The same is true if a user wants to cancel a pending or held order (i.e., they must supply a Order Cancellation Reason).

These reason codes are purely for audit purposes.

###### Automatically Cancelling Old Orders

The system is delivered with a batch process, Cancel Pending/Held Orders (C1-CNPHO), that can be used to cancel held
and/or pending orders that have been open for more than a specified number of days. Refer to the batch control description
for more detail.


-----

The delivered process is built using the Plug-in Driven Background Processes framework. Your implementation can
introduce alternate logic, by duplicating this batch control and replacing the select and/or process records algorithms. For
example, you can introduce a process record algorithm to create a To Do Entry instead of cancelling the order. Adjust the
batch parameters to align with any custom logic you introduce.

###### Additional Things Can Happen When An Order Is Completed

An optional plug-in spot exists on customer class where you can introduce additional logic to be executed when an order is
completed for an account that belongs to this customer class.

Another optional plug-in spot exists on campaign where you can introduce additional logic to be executed when an order is
completed for the campaign.

###### New Premises and Accounts Are Only Created if an Order is Completed

It's important to understand that a premise and account are only created when an order is completed. This means you can
explore alternatives with a prospect who resides at a new premise without introducing the premise / account. However, the
system creates a person if you save an order so that an audit of the customer interaction exists in the system.

###### Premise Geographic Types Are Populated In An Unusual Way

A premise's geographic ID's are used by Control Central when you look for a customer / premise using geographic
identifiers.

**NOTE:**
**Geographic coordinates are optional. An installation option controls whether at least one geographic coordinate is**
required on every premise.

The following points describe how the geographic ID's are populated on premises that are created when an order is
completed:

- If a postal default exists for the new premise's country / postal code, any geographic identifiers on the postal default are
copied onto the new premise.

- If a postal default hasn't been setup for the new premise's country / postal code, the premise will have a single geographic
identifier. It is constructed as follows:

  - The geographic type is defaulted from the campaign.

  - The geographic value is set to ***.

**NOTE:**
**Potential error. If neither the campaign nor the postal defaults results in a geographic type AND the installation record**
indicates at least one geographic type is required on a premise, an error is generated explaining that either postal defaults
or the campaign should be populated with default geographic information.


-----

###### Account And Premise Usage Are Controlled By The Campaign

When you set up a campaign, you define how the campaign's orders use accounts and premises. Refer to the description of
Account Usage and Premise Usage under Campaign - Main for more information.

##### Maintaining Orders

The order transaction can be used to satisfy many diverse requirements. For example, you can use an order to:

- Enroll new customers using a single transaction (i.e., you don't have to use the person, premise, service point, and start /
stop transactions to enroll a new customer who resides at a new premise).

- Sell new products to existing customers.

- Update existing person, account and premise information using a single transaction.

- Market your services to prospects uploaded from a marketing list (and measure the success of your efforts). If the
customer responds to your sales efforts, the system will automatically setup the customer, premise and related service
agreements.

- Setup marketing surveys and record your customers' responses.

- Quickly create one-time charges.

- Set up proposals for prospective services (and then send a quotation to the customer for these services).

- And more...

The topics in this section describe the order transaction. Refer to The Big Picture of Campaigns, Packages and Orders for
general information about orders.

###### Lifecycle of an Order

The following diagram illustrates the lifecycle of an order.

Pending An order starts its life in the Pending state. An order remains in this state until you Cancel, Complete or Hold it.


-----

Held You Hold an order when you want to save an order pending future information. For example, you would hold an
order if you need to perform research on the perfect rate for the customer before completing the order. A Held order can be
Completed or Canceled.

Complete When a customer selects a package of goods and services, the "V" is updated, service agreements are initiated,
and the order becomes Complete. No changes may be made to a Complete order.

Canceled A Pending or Held order may be Canceled.

###### Order User Interface Flow

The diagram that appears below illustrates the anticipated navigation path used to process an order.

**WARNING:**
An order's campaign controls many aspects of the user interface flow. The illustration that appears below is a sample of
what's possible; it may not mirror how your team has setup your company's campaigns.


-----

###### Order - Main

This page is used to define demographic and geographic information about the customer / prospect.

**FASTPATH:**
Refer to The Big Picture of Campaigns, Packages and Orders for more information about orders.

Open this page using Menu > Sales & Marketing > Order > Search.

**FASTPATH:**
Refer to Order User Interface Flow for information about how to use this page.

**Description of Page**

**Order contains a concatenation of the customer's name, campaign, package (if the order is completed), status and start date.**
**Order ID is the system-assigned unique identifier of the order. These values only appear after the order is added to the**
database.

**Status contains the state of the order. Refer to Lifecycle of an Order for information about the valid values and the state**
transition rules. Additional information may also be displayed based on the status:

- If the order's status is Held, the following information is also displayed: the hold reason, the name of the user who held
the order, and the date and time when a reminder for the order is due to be created.

- If the order's status is Canceled, the following information is also displayed: the cancel reason, the name of the user who
canceled the order, and the date and time when the order was canceled.

- If the order's status is Complete, the following information is also displayed: the name of the user who completed the
order and the date and time when the order was completed.

Press the Hold button to hold a Pending order. Refer to Order - Hold Dialog for a description of the pop-up window used to
hold an order.

Press the Cancel button to cancel a Pending or Held order. Refer to Order - Cancel Dialog for a description of the pop-up
window used to cancel an order.

If the Campaign has been setup to allow the completion of orders without selecting a package, a button appears to the right
of Cancel. The label that appears in the button is defined on the Campaign. When pressed, the order is completed. When
the order is completed,

- The "V" is setup / updated.

- All questions and miscellaneous fields (defined on the next tab) are posted to the appropriate object.

- Optional plug-ins are executed.

- You will be transferred to the order completion transaction that's defined on the Campaign (if any).

If the order references an existing person, account, or premise and the related person / account / premise has changed after
their information was snapshot on the order, the Out of Sync section appears. This section highlights which objects have
changed since the order was last saved. In addition, the Sync button appears. When pressed, the order is updated with the
current field values for these objects.

An order's Campaign controls many aspects of the order's behavior. For example, it controls:

- The type of information defaulted onto an order.

- The eligibility-oriented questions that are displayed on the next tab.

- The superset of packages that can be offered to a customer.


-----

- In addition to the above, campaigns also control high-level eligibility rules and business process flows.

An order's Campaign is defaulted as follows:

- When you select a customer on Control Central - Search, you are automatically transferred to the Account Information
portal. One of the zones on this portal page contains the campaigns that can be offered to the customer. If you select a
campaign from this zone, you are transferred to the Order transaction with the respective Campaign defaulted. Note, the
Applicable Campaigns zone only appears if the CSR has modified their preferences to display this zone.

- In all other situations, the order's campaign defaults from the Installation Record.

You may change an order's Campaign at will. Note that changing the campaign will result in the Questions & Misc Fields
(the next tab) being refreshed with values associated with the new campaign. However, other values typically defaulted
from the campaign (such as default customer class) do not get refreshed so that data you may have entered does not get
overwritten.

**Start Date defines the date on which service will start. This date becomes the start date on service agreements created when**
this order is completed. If you need to change the start date on these service agreements, transfer to Start/Stop (where all of
the pending start service agreements will appear).

**NOTE:** Manual date entry is disabled on the start date and the date picker must be used when the Disable Manual Date
Entry Option Type on the Customer Information Options Feature Configuration has been enabled.

The topics that follow describe the remaining sections on this page

###### Order - Main - Person Information

The Person Information section contains demographic information about the customer / prospect.

**WARNING:**
This page contains a subset of person-oriented information. If you need to define other person-oriented information,
transfer to Person - Main after the order is completed.

If this is a new customer, select Create New Person and enter demographic information in the fields that follow. Otherwise,
select Use Existing Person and use the Name field or press the search button to find the customer. After you select an
existing person, the following events takes place:

- The person's name appears beneath the person search (and the person context menu can now be used to drill down to
person-oriented pages). Note, the person's name is formatted by a plug-in algorithm on the installation record. Refer to
the base package's name format algorithm (PERS-INFO) for an example. If you prefer different formatting logic, your
system administrator should configure the system appropriately.

- If any of the Questions & Misc Fields (on the next tab) are used to capture person-oriented characteristics, the person's
existing characteristic values are defaulted.

- If the selected person has at least one account, information about the account is displayed in the Account Information
section (if the Campaign makes uses of accounts). In addition, if any of the Questions & Misc Fields (the next tab)
are used to capture account-oriented characteristics, the account's existing characteristic values are populated in the
respective rows on this tab.

- Information about the person is displayed in the fields that follow.

Use Person/Business to indicate if the customer is a Person or a Business. This value controls how the person's primary
name is validated. Note, for new customers, this value defaults based on the Campaign.

**Names are used by Control Central when you look for a customer based on their name. In addition, a person's primary name**
is the addressee on the person's bill unless overridden by the Override Mailing Name (defined onPerson - Correspondence


-----

Information ). To modify a name, simply move to a field and change its value. To add a new name, press + to insert a row,
then fill in the information for each field. The following fields display:

- Use Name Type to indicate if the name is an Alias, Alternate Representation, Doing Business As, Legal, or Primary
name. Note, for new persons, a value of Primary is defaulted.

- Use Person Name to define the person's name. Note well, the name is case sensitive.

**NOTE:**
**Alternate representations of a person's name. You would use an Alternate Representation for a person's name when**
you have an alternate ways to define the person's primary name. Alternate representations are typically used in countries
that use multiple character sets (e.g., the Primary name is entered in Chinese, the Alternate Representation is entered in
English). When a person has an alternate name, both the main and alternate names can be used to search for a person.
The Alternate Representation Name Type only appears if you have enabled alternate addresses on the installation
record. Refer to the description of the Alternate Representation field under Installation - Main for more information.

**Validation and formatting are performed by plug-ins. The validation that is applied to Person Name (e.g., a comma**
separating the last and first name - Smith,Patricia ) is controlled by a plug-in algorithm on the installation record. More
than one algorithm can be plugged into this plug-in spot. Algorithms plugged into this plug-in spot can also perform
formatting such as removing special characters that your implementation’s business rules do not allow in person names.
Other algorithms can be configured to remove or replace text.

- The Do Not Format switch can be used to bypass any person name formatting done by the algorithms described above.
Validation such as requiring name separator is still applied, but no further formatting is applied. Setting the switch only
applies while the record is being saved and is then reset. The switch is reset because the formatting is only applied when
the record is subsequently changed. This switch is only shown if the Enable Person Name Format Bypass Option Type
on the Customer Information Options Feature Configuration has been enabled

Person Contacts are used by Control Central to look for accounts and persons. For new customers, the person contact
type(s) default based on the Campaign. To modify a person contact, simply move to a field and change its value. To add a
new person contact, press + to insert a row, then fill in the information for each field. The following fields display:

- **Person Contact Type indicates the type of contact such as, home phone, cell phone, or work email.**

- **Contact Information contains the specific contact information such as, the phone number or email address. Enter the**
contact information in the format described.

**NOTE:** **Formatting is performed by a plug-in. The format that is applied to Contact Information is controlled**
by the algorithm that is plugged in on the respective person contact type (refer to Setting Up Person Contact Types
for more information). If you prefer a different format, your system administrator should configure this algorithm
appropriately.

- Enter the Extension, if any, of the contact information. (This field is only active when the contact’s contact routing is
phone or fax.)

- The Primary switch must be set for exactly one person contact for each contact routing.

- **Do Not Disturb (From) and Do Not Disturb (To) indicate the times when a person contact should not be used. (Note:**
these fields are active when the Person Contact Type’s Allow Do Not Disturb information is set to Optional.

**Phone numbers are used by Control Central to look for accounts and persons. For new customers, the phone type(s)**
default based on the Campaign. To modify a telephone number, simply move to a field and change its value. To add a new
telephone number, press + to insert a row, then fill in the information for each field. The following fields display:

- **Phone Type indicates the type of phone number, e.g., Home, Mobile, Business, ...**

- Use Phone Number to define the telephone number. Enter the telephone number in the format described by the Phone
**Format.**


-----

**NOTE:**
**Formatting is performed by a plug-in. The format that is applied to a Phone Number is controlled by the algorithm**
that is plugged in on the respective Phone Type. You can also have this plug-in convert input values into formatted
values, e.g., this algorithm could transform all numbers into a formatted string. If you prefer a different format, your
system administrator should configure this algorithm appropriately.

- Enter the Extension, if any, of the telephone number.

**NOTE:** The Person Phone grid appears when the Legacy Person Phone and Email Option Type on the Customer
Information Options Feature Configuration has been enabled.

A person's ID has several uses:

- It is used by Control Central when you look for a customer / premise based on their ID.

- It is used to highlight potential duplicate persons.

- Control Central displays a person's primary identification in the search results area to help a user identify the customer
when multiple customers match the search criteria.

The person ID usage flag on the installation record indicates whether or not at least one id for a person is required or
optional. The ID Type defaults from the installation record based on the Person Type ( Person versus Business ). The
following fields are used to define a customer's primary ID.

- Select the type of identification from the ID Type drop down.

- Enter the identification number in the ID Number field. Please note that if the ID number should be formatted (e.g.,
dashes in an American social security number), you do not have to include the delimiter (e.g. dashes). You can enter the
ID number as a contiguous value and the system will format it for you. The format is shown adjacent to the ID Number
field.

**NOTE:**
**Formatting is performed by a plug-in. The format that is applied to a person ID number(e.g., dashes in an American**
social security number) is controlled by the algorithm that is plugged in on the respective ID Type. If you prefer a
different format, your system administrator should configure this algorithm appropriately.

**A person can have many forms of identification. The order transaction only caters for a single form of ID (as this is**
the most typical situation). If you want to specify additional person ID's, you must transfer to Person - Main after the
person is created (persons are created when the order is saved).

Specify the customer's Email ID (if any).

**NOTE:** **EmailID appears when the Legacy Person Phone and Email Option Type on the Customer Information Options**
Feature Configuration has been enabled.

Define the Language in which the person prefers their bills and correspondence printed.

**NOTE:**
**Default note. The person's language defaults from Installation Options - Person.**

**FASTPATH:**
Refer to Customer Language for more information on options for supporting multiple languages for your customers.

Use Life Support / Sensitive Load to indicate if the person has life support or sensitive load equipment. Valid values are:
LS/SL (i.e., the person has life support / sensitive load equipment), None. If the customer has LS/SL equipment, make a
note of the type of equipment in the Life Support / Sensitive Load Notes.


-----

**NOTE:**
**A premise can also have life support / sensitive load information. If the equipment is physically linked to the premise**
(e.g., a hospital has life support equipment), you should NOT specify the life support information on the person. Rather,
after the premise is added, transfer to Premise - Misc and specify life support information on the premise.

**Life support affects alerts and C&C. If life support / sensitive load information is specified, an alert will appear**
when the person is displayed on control central. In addition, if a person has life support or sensitive load equipment, it
is possible for a different credit & collection severance process to be kicked off if the person's account associated has
overdue debt. Refer to Designing Your Severance Procedures for more information.

###### Order - Main - Service Address

The Service Address section contains geographic information about the service address:

**WARNING:**
This page contains a subset of premise-oriented information. If you need to define other premise-oriented information,
transfer to Premise - Main after the order is completed.

Whether or not a premise is required or even allowed on an order is controlled by an option on the Campaign. If the
**Campaign disallows the use of a premise, this section will be suppressed. If the Campaign allows the use of a premise, an**
indication of whether a premise is optional or required is displayed adjacent to Service Address.

If a premise is allowed on the order, use the dropdown at the top of this section to tell the system about this order's premise:

- Select No Premise Information if you do not want to associate a premise with this order (e.g., for a one-time charge).

- Select Create New Premise if this is a new premise. You should enter the new premise's address in the remaining fields
in this section.

- Select Use Existing Premise if an existing premise should be used on the order. Use the Address and City fields or press
the search button to find the premise. Refer to Control Central - Search Facilities for suggestions in respect of how to use
these fields. After you select an existing premise, the following events takes place:

  - The premise's description appears beneath the premise search fields (and the premise context menu can now be used
to drill down to premise-oriented pages).

  - If any of the Questions & Misc Fields (the next tab) are used to capture premise-oriented characteristics, the premise's
existing characteristic values are defaulted.

  - Information about the premise is displayed in the fields that follow.

Use Premise Type to describe the type of service location.

The address's constituent fields vary based on the Country. Please refer to the Country page for more information.

Populate Trend Area if the Postal is blank. The Postal and the Trend Area cannot both be blank as the Trend Area is a
required field on the premise and its value is typically defaulted from postal defaults.

**NOTE:**
**Default note. The values of several fields on this and the next page default based on the Country and the Postal. Refer**
to Setting Up Premise & Service Point Postal Defaults for more information. Also note, there are several premiseoriented fields that do not appear on this transaction that will be populated on the premise based on the Country and
**Postal (e.g., characteristics, time zone, trend area, geo ID's).**

Use CIS Division to define the jurisdiction in which the premise is located.


-----

###### Order - Main - Account Information

The Account Information section contains account-oriented information.

**WARNING:**
This page contains a subset of account-oriented information. If you need to define other account-oriented information,
transfer to Account - Main after the order is completed.

Whether or not an account is required or even allowed on an order is controlled by an option on the Campaign. If the
**Campaign disallows the use of an account, this section will be suppressed. If the Campaign allows the use of an account,**
an indication of whether an account is optional or required is displayed adjacent to Account Information.

If an account is allowed on the order, use the dropdown at the top of this section to tell the system about this order's
account:

- Select No Account Information if you do not want to associate an account with this order (e.g., for a person-oriented
marketing survey).

- Select Create New Account if this is a new account. You should enter the new account's information in the remaining
fields in this section.

- Select Use Existing Account if an existing account should be used on the order. If an existing person was selected above,
one of the person's accounts (if any) will be automatically displayed in the Account Information. In addition, if the
order references an existing person, the account search will be limited to accounts associated with this person. If an
**Existing Account is selected, the following takes place:**

  - Basic information about the account appears beneath the search area (and the account context menu can now be used
to drill down to account-oriented pages).

  - If any of the Questions & Misc Fields on the next tab are used to capture account-oriented characteristics, the
account's existing characteristic values are defaulted.

  - Information about the account is displayed in the fields that follow.

If you have set the Installation Option CIS Division Control flag, you must define the new account's CIS Division. The
values are restricted to the user’s CIS Division(s). See Users and CIS Division for more information. The value is defaulted
to user’s primary CIS Division.

**Customer Class plays a part in:**

- If and when a customer is subject to late payment charges.

- The account's default collection class and when the account debt monitor reviews an account. Refer to The Big Picture of
Credit & Collections for more information about how and when an account's debt is reviewed.

- And several other functions. Refer to and Setting Up Customer Classes for more information.

**NOTE:**
**Default note. For new accounts, the Campaign can default the Customer Class. If the campaign does not define a**
customer class, it can be defaulted from the CIS Division, if shown, or installation options.

The optional Account Management Group controls the roles assigned to To Do entries associated with an account. Refer
to Setting Up Account Management Groups for more information.

**NOTE:**
**Default note. For new accounts, Management Group defaults based on the Campaign.**


-----

The remaining fields are used to describe how the bill should be routed to the customer.

**WARNING:**
When an order is completed, several fields that do not appear on this page that reside on Account - Person are populated.
For example, Account Relationship Type, Bill Format, Number of Copies, Receives Notification are all populated
with default values. If you need to override the default values, transfer to Account - Person after the account is added.

Use Bill Route Type to define how the bill is sent to the customer. This field's value defaults from the Installation Record.
This value is important as it controls many options on the remainder of this page. If the Bill Route Type indicates that bills
are routed via Fax, the person's fax number is displayed adjacent (the system knows which of a person's phone numbers
is a fax number by the Phone Type). If the Bill Route Type indicates that bills are routed via Email, the person's Email
address is displayed adjacent. If the Bill Route Type indicates that bills are routed via the Postal service, you must choose
an appropriate Address Source to define which address should be used. Refer to Setting Up Bill Route Types for more
information about bill route types.

If the Bill Route Type indicates that bills are routed via the Postal service, you must choose the appropriate Address
**Source to define which address should be used.**

- Choose Mailing Premise on Account if bills should be sent to the address associated with the Mailing Premise on the
first page. This address is displayed adjacent.

- Choose Person if bills should be sent to theperson's mailing address. This address is displayed adjacent.

- Choose Account Override if bills should be sent to an override address specified below. Typically, you would only
choose this option if the person has multiple accounts and each account's bills should be sent to a different address.

If you select a Address Source of Account Override, you must enter the address to which bills will be sent in the following
address constituents. The number and type of address constituents is based on the Country (refer to Defining Countries for
more information on address constituents). These fields will be protected for other Address Sources. Note, the Country
defaults from Installation Options - System and several other constituents default based on the Country and Postal if a
Postal Default exists for the postal code.

**NOTE:**
By default, the Address Source field is protected on Order – Main page if the Bill Route Type is set to a value other
than Postal. To enable the Address Source field for all Bill Route Types in most circumstances, set the Always Enable
Address Source option type on the General System Configuration feature configuration to Y.

Regardless of the Always Enable Address Source option value, Address Source and Address Information are
displayed but both are disabled when Bill Routing Method is Not Postal and Quote Routing Method (on Account –
Persons page) is Postal. A message “The Main Person receives Quotes at this address. To edit it, go to the 'Persons' tab
_on the Account.” is displayed next to the Address Source._

###### Order - Questions & Misc. Fields

This page has several purposes:

- The order's Campaign can define questions to be posed to customers when an order is taken. For example, you could ask
the customer "marketing survey" questions (e.g., please rate our service, how do you heat your home?, etc.). This page
allows you to capture the customer's response.

- The order's Campaign can also be setup to capture additional fields to be updated on the order's person / account /
premise when the order is completed. For example, you could indicate that the account's override due date and automatic
payment options should be captured when an order is taken. This page allows you to capture these field values.


-----

- The order's Campaign can also be setup to pose eligibility-oriented questions that qualify the customer for packages of
goods and services. For example, you might have a campaign with packages that can only be selected if the customer
commits to a year's worth of service. This page allows you capture the customer's response to these types of questions.

- After entering the above information (and the information on the Main page), you can use this page to select a package of
goods and services for the customer.

- You can use this page to switch the campaign on the order (which would result in new questions and miscellaneous fields
appearing).

their information was snapshot on the order, the Out of Sync section appears. This section highlights which objects have
changed since the order was last saved. In addition, the Sync button appears. When pressed, the order is updated with the
current field values for these objects.

The number and type of Questions & Misc Fields is controlled by the Campaign.

**NOTE:**


-----

**Some questions can be suppressed. The campaign contains an indication if each question is account-oriented, person-**
oriented, premise-oriented or order-oriented. If the question is account-oriented and no account is defined on the Main
tab, the question will be suppressed. If the question is premise-oriented and no premise is defined on the Main tab, the
question will be suppressed.

Each row in this grid has a Prompt and a Response. The value of each Prompt is defined on the Campaign. The
**Response holds the answer supplied by the customer. Please note the following about the Response field:**

- On a Campaign, you can indicate which questions / miscellaneous fields are required. The Response for a required field
is prefixed with an asterisk - * .

- The value of a Response can default from a variety of sources:

  - If an existing person was selected on the Main page AND the response is used to capture a person characteristic, the
existing characteristic value will be defaulted.

  - If an existing premise was selected on the Main page AND the response is used to capture a premise characteristic,
the existing characteristic value will be defaulted. If no value exists, the characteristic values will default based on the
postal defaults associated with the service address's Country and Postal.

  - If an existing account was selected on the Main page AND the response is used to capture an account characteristic,
the existing characteristic value will be defaulted.

  - Otherwise, the characteristic value is defaulted from the Campaign.

- The type of field used to capture a Response is controlled by the Campaign. Depending on the type of Response you may
see Go To buttons and Search buttons.

After entering the Responses to the Questions & Misc Fields, press the Show Eligibility button.

The following may occur when this button is pressed:

- If a new customer is specified on the Main page, a warning will advise you that a new person will be added. The system
needs to add a new person so that an audit of the customer interaction exists.

- The tree expands to show the Order - Eligibility Tree containing package, ineligible package, error package, and other
campaign nodes:

  - Each Package node contains a package that is linked to the campaign whose Eligibility Criteria allows its selection
by the customer. You can expand this node to see the various service agreements that will be created if you select the
package. Selecting one of these packages causes the Order - Package Confirmation page to appear in which you can
confirm your selection.

  - The Ineligible Package(s) node contains packages whose Eligibility Criteria prevents their selection by the customer.

  - The Error Packages node contains packages whose Eligibility Criteria have returned errors (if any).

  - The other campaign(s) node contains alternative campaigns that may be substituted for the current campaign on the
package. Selecting one of these campaigns will cause the campaign to be changed on this order. Changing a campaign
on an order will result in new questions and miscellaneous fields appearing. Refer to The Big Picture Of Campaign
Eligibility for more information.

**NOTE:**
**Some nodes can be suppressed. To increase page performance with large campaigns, you can define a feature**
configuration to suppress the display of the Ineligible Packages, Error Packages or Other Campaign nodes. If a node is
suppressed, it does not appear on the eligibility tree and the system does process the information necessary to display the
node.

###### Order - Package Confirmation

The Package Confirmation page allows you to check the package you selected before the V is created / updated for the
customer. This page opens when you select a package from the eligibility tree on Order - Questions & Misc Fields.

**WARNING:**
If you press the Complete button, a variety of objects may be created (service agreements, service points, a premise,
an account, field activities, etc.). If you need to change any of these objects after order completion, you must transfer
to the respective page on which the object is maintained. You can also use Start/Stop to make changes to the service
agreements created by this transaction.

**Description of Page**

**Order contains a concatenation of basic information about the order. Order ID is the system-assigned unique identifier of**
the order. These values only appear after the order is added to the database.


-----

**Campaign contains basic information about the order's campaign.**

**Package contains basic information about the package.**

**Premise is the address at which service will be delivered.**

The Questions & Misc Fields grid contains the questions and miscellaneous fields that appeared on the order. Note
well, it is possible to design a campaign and a package where some fields are optional on the campaign but required for a
specific package. The Response of all required fields for the selected package are prefixed with an asterisk. Refer to Order Questions & Misc Fields for information about the rows in this grid.

**NOTE:**
**Changing your answers could cause the package to become ineligible. As described earlier, the fields you enter**
on an order play are what the system uses to determine if a package can be selected for a customer. If you change the
answers to the Questions & Misc Fields, the package may no longer be eligible and an error will be presented to you.
You will have the choice of reverting to the original answers or returning to the order page where you can select an
eligible package.

**Additional questions / misc fields are possible. It is possible to design a campaign where certain field values are only**
visible on specific packages. In this scenario, the Questions & Misc Fields grid may contain additional rows for a given
package. Refer to Designing Campaigns and Packages for more information.

The Instructions grid contains package-specific suggestions. These instructions are defined on the package.

The Messages grid contains system-generated messages that summarize what will happen if you press the Complete button.

Press the Complete Order button if you are satisfied with the information on the order. Otherwise, press Do Not Use this
**Package to change or cancel the order.**

###### Order - Hold Dialog

The Order - Hold dialog opens if you press the Hold button on the order transaction. You use it to define why the order is
being held and when you want to be reminded to check up on the order.

**Description of Page**

Use Hold Reason to define why the order is being held.

The following fields are used to control the To Do entry that will be created to remind you about this order.

- Use Reminder Date / Time to define the latest date on which the To Do entry should be created. The reason we
indicated this should be the latest date is because the background process (TD-ECBK) that's responsible for creating
these To Do entries has a parameter called "lead time". This parameter is used to define the number of days before the
**Reminder Date that the To Do entry should be created.**

- If the To Do entry should be addressed to a group of users, choose a ReminderType of Send to Role and enter the user
group's To Do Role. Note, the To Do Role will default from the order's campaign.

- If the To Do entry should be addressed to a specific user, choose a ReminderType of Send to User and enter the user's
User ID in To Do User.

- **Log Notes are used to describe why the order is being held. This information appears in the log entry that is created by**
the system when you hold an order.

If there are any To Do entries (with a status of Open or Being Worked On ) that drill down to this order, a message is
displayed indicating that existing To Do entries for this order will be completed. If the order is already in Hold status,


-----

existing To Do entries are completed when you click the OK button and a new To Do entry is created when the background
process responsible for creating the To Do entries runs.

###### Order - Cancel Dialog

The Order - Cancel dialog opens if you press the Cancel button on the order transaction. You use it to define why the order
is being canceled.

**Description of Page**

Use Cancel Reason to define why the order is being canceled.

Use Log Notes to describe why the order is being canceled. This information appears in the log entry that is created by the
system when you cancel an order.

##### Maintaining Campaigns

When you add an order, you must reference its campaign. An order's campaign controls:

- The type of information defaulted onto an order. For example, you can setup a campaign to default a given account
management group on all orders linked to this campaign. This account management group will then default onto
accounts created when the campaign's orders are completed.

- The eligibility-oriented questions that are posed to the customer when an order is taken. For example, the questions
indicated above - Who is your current energy service provider? / Would you like to pay automatically? / What is your
date of birth? - are all defined on the order's campaign.

- The superset of packages that can be offered to a customer whose order references this campaign. An order's campaign
defines the types of packages that may be selected.

- In addition to the above, campaigns also control high-level eligibility rules and business process flows.

###### Campaign - Main

This page is used to define basic information about a campaign.

**FASTPATH:**
Refer to The Big Picture of Campaigns, Packages and Orders and Designing Campaigns and Packages for more
information.

Open this page using Menu > Sales & Marketing > Campaign > Search.

**Description of Page**

**Campaign is the user-defined code that uniquely identifies the campaign. The campaign's description appears adjacent.**

**Description briefly describes the campaign.**

**Campaign Status describes the state of the campaign. Refer to Lifecycle of a Campaign for more information.**

The following fields contain values to be defaulted onto this campaign's orders. The user who takes the order may override
these default values. Note well, these default values are only applicable for new persons - they will not override field values
defined on existing persons.

- The system requires all persons to be defined as either a Person or a Business. Use Default Person / Business to define
the default value for persons created by this campaign's orders.

- Every person contact defined for a person must reference a person contact type. Use Default Person Contact Type
**1, Default Person Contact Type 2, and Default Person Contact Type 3 to define the first three person contact type**
defaults for persons created by this campaign's orders.

**NOTE:** Person Contact Types appears when the Legacy Person Phone and Email Option Type on the Customer
Information Options Feature Configuration has not been enabled

- Every phone number defined for a person must reference a phone type. Use Default Phone Type 1 and Default Phone
**Type 2 to define the first two phone types defaults for persons created by this campaign's orders.**

**NOTE:** Phone Types appears when the Legacy Person Phone and Email Option Type on the Customer Information
Options Feature Configuration has been enabled.

**Premise Usage controls if and how this campaign's orders use premises. You have the following options:**


-----

- Select Not Allowed if this campaign's orders do not reference a premise.

- Select Optional if this campaign's orders do not have to reference a premise. This option also means that a new OR
existing premise may be specified on the order. Note, if an order references a new premise, the premise will be created
when the order is completed.

- Select Optional - Existing Premise Only if this campaign's orders do not have to reference a premise. This option also
means that only an existing premise may be specified on an order.

- Select Required if this campaign's orders must reference a premise. This option also means that a new OR existing
premise may be specified on the order. Note, if an order references a new premise, the premise will be created when the
order is completed.

- Select Required - Existing Premise Only if this campaign's orders must reference a premise. This option also means that
only an existing premise may be specified on an order.

The following fields contain values to be defaulted onto this campaign's orders. The user who takes the order may override
these default values. Note well, these default values are only applicable for new premises - they will not override field
values defined on existing premises.

- The system requires all premises to reference a premise type. Use Default Premise Type to define the default value for
premises created by this campaign's orders.

- Every geographic ID defined for a premise must reference ageographic type. Use Default Premise Geo Type to define
the default value for premises created by this campaign's orders. Refer to Premise Geographic Types Are Populated In
An Unusual Way.

**Account Usage controls if and how this campaign's orders use accounts. You have the following options:**

- Select Not Allowed if this campaign's orders do not reference an account.

- Select Optional if this campaign's orders do not have to reference an account. This option also means that a new OR
existing account may be specified on the order. Note, if an order references a new account, the account will be created
when the order is completed.

- Select Optional - Existing Account Only if this campaign's orders do not have to reference an account. This option also
means that only an existing account may be specified on an order.

- Select Required if this campaign's orders must reference an account. This option also means that a new OR existing
account may be specified on the order. Note, if an order references a new account, the account will be created when the
order is completed.

- Select Required - Existing Account Only if this campaign's orders must reference an account. This option also means that
only an existing account may be specified on an order.

The following fields contain values to be defaulted onto this campaign's orders. The user who takes the order may override
these default values. Note well, these default values are only applicable for new accounts - they will not override field
values defined on existing accounts.

- The system requires all accounts to belong to a customer class. Use Default Customer Class to define the default value
for accounts created by this campaign's orders.

- An account may reference an account management group. Use Default Acct Management Group to define the default
value for accounts created by this campaign's orders.

If a user holds one of the campaign's orders, they can have a To Do entry generated on a future date to remind them about
the order. Use Default Hold To Do Role to define the group of users to whom the To Do entry will be sent. Note well, the
user who holds an order can indicate that the related To Do entry should be addressed to a specific user ID rather than a
**Role.**

Use Order Open Option to define the page that is displayed when a user adds a new order for this campaign. This field
is only relevant when the order transaction is invoked in "add mode" and a campaign is passed to this transaction (e.g., if a
user adds an order from the Applicable Campaigns Zone).


-----

A user can be automatically transferred to a different transaction when they complete an order. Refer to Supported Business
Processes for examples of transactions that we anticipate being used. Use Navigation Option to define this transaction.
Note,

- Leave Navigation Option blank if the user should remain on the order transaction after completion.

- You can setup Navigation Options to transfer to the user to a tab other than the main tab.

If a user is allowed to complete this campaign's order's without selecting a package,

- Turn on Allow Order Compl w/o Package and

- Use Order Compl w/o Package Label to define the message to appear in the button used to complete such orders.

**FASTPATH:**
Refer to Campaigns Without Packages for examples of campaigns where you would enable the above fields.

Use Long Description to provide an overview of this campaign.

The grid at the bottom of the page summarizes this campaign's questions and miscellaneous fields. To change this
information, press the adjacent go to button (which will transfer you to the Questions and Misc Fields tab). To add
additional information, transfer to the Questions and Misc Fields tab and press the + button.

###### Campaign - Questions and Misc. Fields

This page is used to define the following type of information:

- An order's campaign can define questions to be posed to customers when an order is taken. For example, you could ask
the customer "marketing survey" questions (e.g., please rate our service, how do you heat your home?, etc.).

- An order's campaign can also be setup to capture additional fields to be updated on the order's person / account / premise
when the order is completed. For example, you could indicate that the account's override due date and automatic
payment options should be captured when an order is taken.

- An order's campaign can also be setup to pose eligibility-oriented questions that qualify the customer for packages of
goods and services. For example, you might have a campaign with packages that can only be selected if the customer
commits to a year's worth of service.

**FASTPATH:**
Refer to Designing Campaigns and Packages for information describing how to design this type of information for your
campaigns.

Open this page using Sales & Marketing, Campaign and navigate to the Question & Misc Fields tab.

**Description of Page**

**WARNING:**
This information is not intuitive; we strongly recommend that you follow the guidelines under Designing Campaigns
and Packages before attempting to enter this information.

**Campaign is the user-defined code that uniquely identifies the campaign. The campaign's description appears adjacent.**

The Questions & Misc Fields scroll contains one row for each question / miscellaneous field captured on this campaign's
orders. The following fields are used:

- **Prompt on Order contains the prompt that is shown to the user when the order is taken. Refer to Determine The**
Properties Of Every Miscellaneous Field for examples.


-----

- **Brief Description is simply a brief description of the question / miscellaneous field.**

- **Sort Sequence controls the order in which the question appears on the order.**

- **Applicability controls whether the field is Optional, Required, or Only Applicable on Package.**

  - A value of Required means the order taker must enter a valid value before packages are displayed for selection.

  - A value of Optional means the order taken can leave the field blank prior to package selection. You can make an
Optional field Required on individual packages.

  - A value of Only Applicable on Package is used for fields that are only captured for specific packages. Fields of this
type are suppressed prior to package selection. When you setup a package, you indicate if the field is applicable (if so,
the user is only prompted for the field if the package is selected).

- **Type of Response controls where the field is stored when the order is completed and how it is validated. You have two**
options: Characteristic or Column.

  - If a field is a Characteristic, you must define which entity the characteristic value is to be stored on when the order is
completed ( Person, Account, Premise or Order ). You must also define the Characteristic Type as this controls the
characteristic value entered by the user.

  - If a field's value resides in a Column (as opposed to a characteristic value), you must define the column reference. A
field's Column Reference controls three things:

- How the field's value is retrieved. A field's value is retrieved when an existing person / account / premise is referenced on
an order.

- How the field's value is validated. A field's value is validated before package eligibility is determined and before the
order is completed.

- How the field's value is posted (i.e., updated on the database). A field's value is posted when an order is completed.

**FASTPATH:**
Refer to Extract Column References From Miscellaneous Fields for more information about column references.

- If a field's value resides in a Column (as opposed to a characteristic value), you must also define whether the question /
field is dependent on the order referencing an account or premise. You do this by populating Question Dependency with
one of the following values:

- Select Must Have Account if this question / field should only appear if the order references an account (new OR
existing).

- Select Must Have Premise if this question / field should only appear if the order references a premise (new OR existing).

- Select No Dependency if this question / field should always appear.

**FASTPATH:**
Refer to Determine Account / Premise Dependencies For Column References for more information.

- **Default Column Value / Default Char Value controls whether the order taker is supplied with a default value when an**
order is created. Note well: for Optional and Only Applicable on Package fields, you can specify a different default value
on each package.

###### Campaign - Algorithms

This page defines plug-in algorithms that are executed for orders associated with this campaign. Open this page using Menu

- Sales & Marketing > Campaign > Search and navigate to the Algorithms page.

**Description of Page**


-----

**Campaign is the user-defined code that uniquely identifies the campaign. The campaign's description appears adjacent.**

The grid contains Algorithms that control campaign-oriented functions. You must define the following for each plug-in
algorithm:

- Specify the System Event with which the algorithm is associated (see the table that follows for a description of all
possible events).

- Specify the Sequence and Algorithm for each System Event. You can set the Sequence Number to 10 unless you
have a System Event that has multiple Algorithms. In this case, you need to tell the system the Sequence in which they
should execute.

You can define algorithms for the following System Events:

System Event Optional / Required Description

Campaign Eligibility Required A campaign's eligibility algorithms control two

things:

                                                - Whether the campaign appears in the

Applicable Campaigns Zone. This content

zone suggests possible campaigns for

the current customer displayed on control

central. You might want to use this zone if you

have different campaigns that are offered to

different types of customers. Refer to Real
time Marketing of Additional Services to a

Customer for an example of how this content

zone can be used to "up sell" additional

services.

                                              - Whether the campaign appears on an

order's eligibility tree. Campaigns that appear

in this tree are alternate campaigns that may

be used on an order. Refer to Real-time

Marketing of Services to a Prospect for an

example of how an order's eligibility tree can

contain alternate campaigns for an order.

Refer to The Big Picture Of Campaign

Eligibility for information about these

algorithms.

Order Completion Optional When an order is completed for this

campaign, algorithms plugged into this spot

are called to do additional work (e.g., create a

customer contact). You need only specify this

type of algorithm if you require additional work

to be performed when an order is completed

for this campaign.

###### Campaign - Package

A package controls the various types of service agreements that will be created if the customer selects the package. This
page summarizes all packages that may be selected on orders associated with this campaign. Open this page using Menu >
**Sales & Marketing > Campaign > Search and navigate to the Package page.**


-----

**Description of Page**

**Campaign is the user-defined code that uniquely identifies the campaign. The campaign's description appears adjacent.**

The grid contains an entry for every package associated with this campaign. To view or change a package, press the
adjacent go to button (which will transfer you to Package - Main). To add a new package, use the Campaign context menu
to transfer to Package - Main in add mode.

##### Maintaining Packages

After a user enters basic information about a customer on an order, they are shown the various packages that may be offered
to the customer. A package controls the various types of service agreements that will be created if the customer selects the
package.

If the customer elects to take a package, the system sets up / updates the "V" (along with all of the ancillary things that
happen when service is initiated, e.g., field activities are created).

The topics in this section describe the package transaction.

**FASTPATH:**
Refer to The Big Picture of Campaigns, Packages and Orders for general information about packages. Refer to The Big
Picture Of Package Eligibility Rules for a discussion of how to control which packages can be used for different types of
customers. Refer to Designing Campaigns and Packages for guidelines describing how to design your packages.

**NOTE:**
**An order can be completed without selecting a package. It is possible to use the order transaction to simply create /**
update persons and accounts. Refer to Campaigns Without Packages for more information.

The grid contains one row for every Questions & Misc Field defined on the Campaign. You need only modify this
information if this package behaves differently than the campaign (e.g., a field is required on the package, but optional on
the campaign). To override a field on this package, turn on the Override switch and change the appropriate fields. There are
several restrictions in respect of what can be overridden as described below:

- If a question / miscellaneous field is Required on the campaign, no fields may be overridden on the package.

- If a question / miscellaneous field is Optional on the campaign, you may override all field values. However, if the
package has been used on a Completed order, you may not change its Applicability to be Required.

- If a question / miscellaneous field is designated as only applicable on package on the campaign, you should designate
its applicability as Required, Optional or Not Used On This Package. If the field is either Required or Optional on this
package, you may also override the other field values. Please note that if the package has been used on a Completed
order, you may not change its Applicability to be Required.

**WARNING:**
The following information is not intuitive; we strongly recommend that you follow the guidelines under The Big Picture
Of Package Eligibility and Determine Package Eligibility Rules before attempting to enter this information.

The Eligibility Criteria Group scroll contains one entry for each group of eligibility criteria. The following fields may be
defined for each group:

- Use Sequence to control the relative order in which the group is executed when the system determines if the package can
be selected on an order (smaller numbers are executed before larger numbers).

- Use Description and Long Description to describe the criteria group.

- Use If Group is True to define what should happen if the eligibility criteria (defined in the following grid) return a value
of True.

  - Choose Eligible if this package can be selected on the order.

  - Choose Ineligible if this package cannot be selected on the order.

  - Choose Check Next Group if the next criteria group should be checked.

- Use If Group is False to define what should happen if the eligibility criteria (defined in the following grid) return a
value of False.

  - Choose Eligible if this package can be selected on the order.

  - Choose Ineligible if this package cannot be selected on the order.

  - Choose Check Next Group if the next criteria group should be checked.

The grid that follows contains the package's eligibility criteria. Think of each row as an "if statement" that can result in
the related eligibility group being True or False. For example, you might have a row that indicates the customer is eligible
for the package if their customer class is residential. The following bullets provide a brief description of each field on an
eligibility criterion. Please refer to Defining Logical Criteria for several examples of how this information can be used.

- Use Sequence to control the order in which the criteria are checked.

- Use Criteria Field to define the field to compare:

  - Choose Field if you want to compare a response to a question / miscellaneous field to a given value. Push the adjacent
search button to select the field.

  - Choose Algorithm if you want to compare anything other than a response to a question / miscellaneous field. Push the
adjacent search button to select the algorithm that is responsible for retrieving the comparison value.

- Use Criteria Comparison to define the method of comparison:

  - Choose Algorithm if you want an algorithm to perform the comparison and return a value of True, False or
Insufficient Data.

  - Choose any other option if you want to compare the Criteria Field Type using a logical operator. The following
options are available:

- Use >, <, =, >=, <=, <> (not equal) to compare the Criteria Field Type using standard logical operators. Enter the
comparison value in the adjacent field.

- Use In to compare the Criteria Field Type to a list of values. Each value is separated by a comma. For example, if a
field value must equal 1, 3 or 9, you would enter a comparison value of 1,3,9.

- Use Between to compare the Criteria Field Type to a range of values. For example, if a field value must be between 1
and 9, you would enter a comparison value of 1,9. Note, the comparison is inclusive of the low and high values.


-----

  - The next three fields control whether the related logical criteria cause the eligibility group to be considered True or
False:

    - Use If True to control what happens if the related logical criterion returns a value of True. You have the options
of Group is true, Group is false, or Check next condition. If you indicate Group is true or Group is false, then the
package will be judged Ineligible or Eligible based on the values defined above in If Group is False and If Group
**is True.**

    - Use If False to control what happens if the related logical criterion returns a value of False. You have the options
of Group is true, Group is false, or Check next condition. If you indicate Group is true or Group is false, then the
package will be judged Ineligible or Eligible based on the values defined above in If Group is False and If Group
**is True.**

    - Use If Insufficient Data to control what happens if the related logical criterion returns a value of "Insufficient
Data". You have the options of Group is true, Group is false, or Check next condition. If you indicate Group is true
or Group is false, then the package will be judged Ineligible or Eligible based on the values defined above in If
**Group is False and If Group is True.**

##### The Big Picture of Program Management

The program management functionality satisfies many diverse requirements. For example, you can use this functionality to:

- Market your products and/or services to customers and measure the success of your efforts.

- Encourage customers to enroll in various sales and marketing initiatives. For example, you can use program management
to organize a campaign to encourage customers to participate in a conservation program, or to sign up for special contract
options.

- Set up marketing surveys and record your customer’s responses.

- Assign representatives to accounts.

- And more…

The topics in this section provide more information about the program management functionality.


-----

###### The Big Picture of Initiatives, Leads, and Representatives

Three objects are at the heart of the program management functionality: Initiatives, Leads, and Representatives.

- An initiative defines a structured campaign that outlines the efforts to encourage customers to participate in a program
targeted at a specific market segment.

- A lead is an instance of an initiative for targeted customers.

- There are two types of Representatives:

  - A Sales Representative is a user or group of users who can be assigned to follow up or manage leads. This
representative is also responsible to sell or encourage the customer to participate in a program.

  - A Third Party Representative is a third party (typically external) who can receive assignments to perform specific
tasks within a lead; such as, undertaking a visit to a property to perform an inspection, and installation work)

The topics in this section provide background information about these objects.

###### The Big Picture of Initiatives

An initiative defines a structured campaign designed to encourage customers to participate in a program. An initiative can:

- Target a market segment by specifying criteria that must be satisfied before leads are generated for customers.

- Ensure that customers are still eligible to participate in a program at sign up or enrollment time.

- Define a structured marketing effort for the events or actions that should take place during the life of a lead to encourage
a customer to participate in the program.

- Define whether the lead is related to other objects (such as, the premise) in addition to the account.

- Contain sub-initiatives. Together, an initiative and its subsidiary initiatives form an initiative hierarchy. This supports
reporting purposes and the analysis of the success of different market segments and marketing efforts.

Refer to Maintaining Initiatives for more information.

###### About Initiative Hierarchies

Initiatives form an initiative hierarchy when one initiative is configured as a sub-initiative to a parent initiative. An initiative
hierarchy can be used when a program is targeted at several market segments, or when different market segments each
require a unique marketing effort to be executed. Initiative hierarchies can be up to five levels deep.

The following is a general example of a multi-level initiative hierarchy:

- Level 1 could be a “strategy” initiative.

- Level 2 could contain multiple campaigns. Each campaign can have a different way of marketing the strategy.

- Level 3 could define multiple marketing efforts. Each effort can have a different method for marketing the campaign.

- Level 4 could contain market segments that are the targets of a marketing effort.

**NOTE:** The terms used above are just for the example. Your implementation would define the actual terms used for the
levels in an initiative hierarchy.

A parent initiative may be set up for reporting purposes, in which case you could choose to configure the initiative so that
no leads are generated for it. For example, a “strategy” may not have eligibility criteria or lead event type profile defined
against it. It may simply have sub-initiatives to define segments, and those segments could be the initiatives for which leads


-----

are generated. Reporting is able to be performed at the multiple levels in order to summarize the effectiveness of the subinitiatives.

###### The Components of an Initiative

The topics in this section provide information about the components of an initiative.

###### About Initiative Eligibility Criteria

Each initiative can define its target market by specifying the criteria that must be satisfied before a customer is invited
to participate in a program. It can also confirm that the customer is still eligible to participate in a program at sign up or
enrollment time. An initiative may have zero, one, or many eligibility criteria. Each customer is subjected to these criteria to
determine whether they will have a lead generated for them for the initiative and/or whether they are still eligible to sign up
or enroll into a program.

Designing these criteria can be easy or time-consuming; it all depends on the complexity of your business rules. The
base product provides a number of initiative eligibility criteria types. Most of them perform comparisons based on a
specific field; for example, one of the criteria types checks whether an account has submitted a rebate claim for a specific
conservation program. Some types of eligibility criteria could simply check whether or not a specific condition is true. For
instance, a base-supplied eligibility criteria business object checks that there is no active credit and collection process for the
account.

Other types of eligibility criteria perform comparisons with scalar values (such as, a number of days, number of kwh) or
with derived values (such as, attributes of an account). The base product provides a Freeform Criteria business object that
can be used for these purposes. This business object provides flexibility in that the value to supply in the comparison field is
driven by a Derive Value Algorithm Type. A number of these algorithm types are delivered with this business object. Your
implementations can add to these algorithm types as needed.

Your implementation can decide to use specific criteria business objects (base-supplied and/or implementation-specific),
extend the base-supplied Freeform Criteria business object, or a mixture of both. Refer to Designing Initiative Eligibility
Criteria for more details.

To set up an eligibility criterion, you must define the following:

- When the eligibility criterion should be executed - also called criteria execution point

- The field to be compared

- The comparison method

For the criteria execution point, the options include:

- Prior to a lead being generated for a customer

- Prior to the customer being signed up or enrolled into a program

- Both of the above

For the field to be compared, you can execute an algorithm to:

- Retrieve a field value or values from someplace else in the system (such as, the customer class or types of services
associated with the customer)

- Derive a value based on some data from someplace else in the system (such as, the number of days since the last lead
was created for the customer)

For the comparison method, you select the operator to perform the comparison on the field to be compared. The result
from the algorithm will be TRUE, FALSE, or INSUFFICIENT DATA. Each of these results should specify the next action.
The valid actions include:

- Indicate that the customer is eligible

- Indicate that the customer is not eligible


-----

- Check the next condition

- Issue an error (this option is only available for Insufficient Data )

Refer to Defining Eligibility Criteria for an Initiative for more information about setting up eligibility criteria on an
initiative.

###### About Related Object Criteria

Each initiative can define its target market by specifying the criteria that must be satisfied before a customer is invited to
participate in a program (see About Initiative Eligibility Criteria for more information). An initiative may also be targeted
at a specific entity (or related object) for that customer; for example, assume a customer has two properties in two different
states - one in State A and one in State B. The customer may only be invited to participate, or be eligible, for a program
for their specific property located in State A. In this situation, each eligible customer may then be subjected to Related
Object Criteria following the execution of Initiative Eligibility Criteria to determine which of their properties are eligible to
participate in a program (meaning, have one lead generated just for the account if one of their properties meets the criteria
or a lead generated for each of the customer’s eligible properties).

An initiative defines the related object(s) to associate with leads via the Object Nomination algorithm on the initiative
business object. The lead generation process executes the object nomination algorithm after executing initiative eligibility
criteria. The base-supplied Initiative parent business object (C1–Initiative) is configured with an object nomination
algorithm that retrieves the premises that are associated with the account’s active and pending start service agreement’s
service points. The algorithm applies the related object criteria (configured on the initiative) to each premise and if the
premise is deemed eligible, it is returned as a related object for the lead.

Designing related object criteria can be easy or time-consuming. It all depends on the complexity of your business rules.
The base product provides examples of related object criteria that looks for one or more premises to associate with a lead.
One example checks for premises with a specific service point type. Another looks for a premise using its geographic
value. For additional ways to find premises to link to a lead, implementations can either add specific related object criteria
business objects (similar to the base samples) or extend the base-supplied Freeform Premise Criteria business object.
The Freeform Premise Criteria business object provides flexibility in that the value to supply in the comparison field is
driven by a Derive Value Algorithm Type. A number of these algorithm types are delivered with this business object. Your
implementation can add to these algorithm types as needed. Refer to Designing Related Object Criteria for more details.

When you set up a related object criterion, you must define two things:

- The field to be compared.

- The comparison method.

For the field to be compared, you can execute an algorithm to retrieve a field value or values from someplace else in the
system; for example, retrieve a premise’s service point types for which the customer has service.

For the comparison method, select the operator to perform the comparison on the field to be compared. The result from the
comparison will be TRUE, FALSE, or INSUFFICIENT DATA. Each of these results should specify the next action. The
valid actions include:

- Indicate that the related object is eligible

- Indicate that the related object is not eligible

- Check the next condition

- Issue an error

Refer to Defining Related Object Criteria for an Initiative for more information.

###### Examples of Initiative Criteria

The following is an example of how to set up initiative criteria.


-----

**Initiative: Smart Rate Program For Residential Customers**
The program targets summertime pricing for residential customers. Customers are required to reduce energy use between 2
PM and 7 PM for no more than 15 summer days, which are referred to as smart days. A higher rate is charged during this
time period. A discounted rate is applied for all other times during the season.

**Initiative Eligibility Criteria**
To be eligible for this initiative, the account must be a residential account with an average daily usage that is more than 10
kWh, not currently on a smart rate program, and is on either the ERES1 or ERES2 rate schedule. The account must also not
have any active credit and collection process.

###### About the Lead Event Type Profile

Each initiative can define a structured marketing effort for the events or actions that should take place during the life of
a lead to encourage a customer to participate in a program. Each event or action is defined by a Lead Event Type. For
example, one event could be that a letter or an email is sent to a customer. The collection and sequencing of lead event types
defined on an initiative is referred to as the Lead Event Type Profile.

Refer to Creating Initiatives and Maintaining Initiatives for more information on setting up and maintaining the Lead Event
Type Profile on an initiative.

###### About the Initiative Log

Every initiative has a log holding its history. Entries are added to the log when meaningful events occur, for example:

- When an initiative is created.

- When an initiative’s status changes (e.g. transitions to the active, accumulate statistics, inactive states).

- When lead related background processes are submitted for execution.

- When users want to manually add log entries as desired.

###### The Lifecycle of an Initiative

The following diagram shows the possible lifecycle of an Initiative:


-----

**Pending state: An initiative starts out in a pending state.**

**Active state: An initiative is transitioned manually by a user to the active state. Leads can only be generated for an initiative**
in an active state.

**Accumulate Statistics state: A user or the system may transition an active initiative to a periodically transitioning**
accumulate statistics state. During this state, statistics for the initiative are accumulated prior to returning back to the active
state.

**Inactive state: An initiative may be transitioned manually by a user to the inactive state when they want to deactivate**
the initiative either temporarily or permanently. A user can manually place the initiative back to the active state from the
inactive state.

Refer to Maintaining Initiatives for more information.

###### Initiative Information Can Be Overridden

“Initiative info” is the concatenated string of information that summarizes an initiative throughout the system. The basepackage logic constructs this string by concatenating the following information:

- Initiative description

- Status of the initiative

- Start date and end date (if available) of the initiative

If you'd prefer a different info string, you can develop a new algorithm and plug-it in on the Initiative’s maintenance object.

###### The Big Picture of Leads

A lead is an instance of an initiative for a targeted customer. A lead may contain events or actions that are there to
encourage a customer to participate in a program.

Refer to Maintaining Leads for more information about working with Leads.

###### How Leads Are Created

Leads are created as follows:


-----

- The system can generate a lead, or leads, for each customer that satisfies the initiative eligibility criteria and/or related
object criteria that is defined on an initiative.

- Users can manually create a lead at their discretion.

Refer to section Creating Leads from an Initiative and Manually Creating a Lead for more information.

###### The Components of a Lead

A lead has two components: A Lead Event and a Lead Log.

**Lead Event**
A lead has one or more lead events. These events are the actions designed to encourage a customer to participate in a
program. For example, one event could be that a letter or an email is sent to a customer.

Refer to The Big Picture of Lead Events for more information.

**Lead Log**
Every lead has a log holding its history. Entries are added to the log when meaningful events occur, for example:

- When a lead is created

- When a lead’s status changes (e.g. transitions to the active, successful or discarded state)

- When a lead event executes

- Users can manually add log entries as desired.

###### The Lifecycle of a Lead

The following diagram shows the possible lifecycle of a Lead:

**Pending state: Leads can be created in either the Pending or Active state. By generating them in the Pending state, you**
can verify the targeted customers before actively marketing the initiative.

**Active state: Leads can be created in either the Pending or Active state. When a lead is created or transitioned to the**
**Active state, lead events are created to encourage the customers to participate in the initiative. For example, one event could**
be that a letter or an email is sent to a customer. The lead events and the sequence in which they occur are defined on the
initiative’s lead event type profile. The lead remains in the active state while it is being actively marketed to the customer.


-----

**Successful state: The system infers that a lead has succeeded by the creation of other data in the system, at which time the**
lead transitions to the Successful state. For example:

- If an active lead for a customer is related to a rebate claim conservation program, the lead is determined to be successful
when that rebate claim is filed for the customer.

- If an active lead for a customer is related to a contract option, the lead is determined to be successful when the
customer’s service agreement is linked to that contract option.

- If an active lead for a customer is related to a campaign, the lead is determined to be successful if a completed order
exists for the customer for the campaign.

- If an active lead is assigned to a third party representative (to perform one or more tasks), the lead is determined to be
successful if the Notify Third Party lead event is completed.

**Discarded state: An unsuccessful lead transitions to the Discarded state after a certain amount of time has passed, as**
defined on the initiative. If the initiative does not specify a time period, the lead remains in the active state until a user
manually discards it.

Refer to Maintaining Leads for more information.

###### Advanced Analysis of Leads

Leads can be sent to an external system (such as Oracle DataRaker) for advanced analysis prior to activating the lead.

The base product provides Advanced Analysis System Lead (C1–AdvancedAnalysisLead) business object for this purpose.
Its lifecycle includes steps to send the lead to the external system and activate/discard the lead based on the result of
analysis..

Additional configuration is needed in Program Management master configuration to enable external analysis/validation. See
master configuration embedded help for more details.

###### The Lifecycle of a Lead with Advanced Analysis

The following describes the states of a Lead that is sent to an external system for advanced analysis prior to activation..

(Refer to the C1–AdvancedAnalysisLead business object to view the lifecycle diagram.)

**Pending state: Leads can be created in either the Pending or Ready for Extract state. By generating them in the Pending**
state, you can verify the targeted customers before actively marketing the initiative.

**Ready for Extract state: At this state, leads are ready to be sent to the external system for analysis. A monitor batch**
process is defined on this state, to ensure that leads in this state are transitioned only when the batch process runs.

**Waiting for Analysis state: When a lead is transitioned to this state, an outbound message containing lead information is**
sent to the external system.

**Error state: The lead is transitioned to this state if the system is unable to send the outbound message. Retry logic on this**
state will attempt to resend the lead to the external system. Leads in this state can also be Discarded if needed.

**Active state: When a lead completes external analysis, the External Validation and External Activation Priority flags on**
the lead are updated. An inbound web service sends back the lead and transitions the lead into the Active state. An enter
algorithm evaluates the External Activation Priority flag. If the lead is marked as being a priority for activation (based on
settings in master configuration), the lead stays in the Active state. Otherwise, the lead is Discarded.

When a lead is in the Active state, lead events are created to encourage the customers to participate in the initiative. For
example, one event could be that a letter or an email is sent to a customer. The lead events and the sequence in which they
occur are defined on the initiative’s lead event type profile. The lead remains in the active state while it is being actively
marketed to the customer.

**Successful state: The system infers that a lead has succeeded by the creation of other data in the system, at which time the**
lead transitions to the Successful state. For example:


-----

- If an active lead for a customer is related to a rebate claim conservation program, the lead is determined to be successful
when that rebate claim is filed for the customer.

- If an active lead for a customer is related to a contract option, the lead is determined to be successful when the
customer’s service agreement is linked to that contract option.

- If an active lead for a customer is related to a campaign, the lead is determined to be successful if a completed order
exists for the customer for the campaign.

- If an active lead is assigned to a third party representative (to perform one or more tasks), the lead is determined to be
successful if the Notify Third Party lead event is completed.

An enter algorithm on this state sends an outbound message, to notify the external system about lead success.

**Discarded state: Leads that are evaluated as non-priority for activation are transitioned to this state. Unsuccessful leads**
also transition to this state after a certain amount of time has passed, as defined on the initiative. If the initiative does not
specify a time period, unsuccessful leads remain in the Active state until a user manually discards it.

Refer to Maintaining Leads for more information.

###### Lead Information Can Be Overridden

“Lead info” is the concatenated string of information that summarizes a lead throughout the system. The base-package logic
constructs this string by concatenating the following information:

- Initiative description

- Status of the lead

- Creation date/time of the lead.

If you'd prefer a different info string, you can develop a new algorithm and plug-it in on the Lead’s maintenance object.

###### Leads Are Highlighted As Alerts

If you plug-in the appropriate alert algorithm (C1-OPENLDALR) on the Installation record, alert(s) will be shown for open
leads associated with the person, account and premise in context. A separate alert is shown for each unique Lead that is in a
non-final state. Each alert message shows the Lead's info string.

###### How and When Are Leads Activated

Leads are activated as follows:

- The system can generate a lead for each customer that satisfies the initiative eligibility criteria and/or related object
criteria that is defined on an initiative. The leads can be created in either a Pending or Active state. These leads can then
be activated by a background process when required by the user.

- Users can manually activate a lead at their discretion.

Refer to section Creating Leads from an Initiative and Maintaining a Lead for more information.

###### How are Leads Completed

The system infers that a lead has succeeded by the creation of other data in the system, at which time the lead transitions to
the Successful state. For example:

- If an active lead is related to a rebate claim conservation program, the lead is determined to be successful when that
rebate claim is filed for the customer.


-----

- If an active lead is related to a contract option, the lead is determined to be successful when the customer’s service
agreement is linked to that contract option.

- If an active lead for is related to a campaign, the lead is determined to be successful if a completed order exists for the
customer for the campaign.

- If an active lead is assigned to a third party representative, to perform one or more tasks, the lead is determined to be
successful if the Notify Third Party lead event is completed.

Users can also manually transition a lead to the Successful state at their discretion. Refer to Maintaining a Lead for more
information about working with Leads.

###### How Are Leads Discarded

When leads are sent to an external system for analysis prior to lead activation, a possible result of the analysis is that the
lead is flagged as non-priority for activation. When this occurs, the lead is discarded.

Unsuccessful leads transition to the Discarded state after a certain amount of time has passed, as defined on the initiative.
The initiative’s lead event type profile can include an event that automatically discards a lead after a designated number
of days. If the initiative does not specify this auto-discard event, the lead remains in the active state until a user manually
discards it.

Some types of lead events can also trigger a lead to be discarded when specific conditions are met; for example, a lead that
is assigned to a third party representative can be automatically discarded when the third party representative finds that the
account is ineligible for the initiative. Refer to The Lifecycle of a Third Party Representative for more details.

In addition, automatic lead discards capture a lead discard reason. Lead event types that support auto-discard define their
respective default lead discard reasons. Refer to Setting Up Lead Event Types and Maintaining a Lead for more information

###### Sign Up Options Can Be Overridden

The lead’s Sign Up special action button performs the following:

- Displays a Sign Up UI map (if one exists) to capture additional inputs for sign up processing.

- Executes a Sign Up service script to process the sign up.

- Displays a confirmation map if the sign up is successful.

The Sign Up UI map and Sign Up service script can be overridden via options on the initiative’s business object. Refer to
Overriding Initiative Sign Up Options for more details.

###### The Big Picture of Lead Events

A lead has one or more lead events. These events are the actions designed to encourage a customer to participate in a
program. For example, one event could be that a letter or an email is sent to a customer.

You define the number and type of events to be initially inherited by a lead by configuring the Lead Event Type Profile on
an initiative. Refer to About the Lead Event Type Profile for more information.

A lead event can include one or more steps. The lead event type defines a list of step types, if applicable.

The topics in this section provide additional information about lead events.

###### How are Lead Events Created

If a lead is created in a Pending state, there are no lead events associated with the lead. It is only when leads are created in
or transitioned to the Active state, that lead events are created for the lead. The initial number of events and when the events
shall occur are inherited from the lead’s initiative.


-----

Some types of events can also get created as a result of special actions on the lead. For instance, when a lead process
requires a third party representative to perform one or more tasks after signup, the Sign Up action on the Lead portal
automatically creates the Notify Third Party lead event.

###### The Components of a Lead Event

A lead event can have one or more steps. The lead event’s business object defines whether or not steps are applicable to
that type of event. The corresponding lead event type defines the valid step types. For an example, refer to the Third Party
Lead Event (C1-ThirdPartyLeadEvt) and Send Notification to Third Party Lead Event Type (C1-LETypeNotifyThirdParty)
business objects provided in base.

**Lead Event Log**

Every lead event has a log holding its history. Entries are added to the log when meaningful events occur, for example:

- When a lead event is created.

- When a lead event’s status changes (e.g. transitions to the completed or cancelled state).

- Details of the content sent (if applicable).

- Users can manually add log entries as desired.

###### The Lifecycle of a Lead Event

The following diagram shows the possible lifecycle of a Lead Event business object:

**Pending state: Lead events are initially created in the Pending state. A lead event can take a number of paths after it is**
created; it all depends on how you’ve configured the system.

**Complete state: A lead event contains a date when it should be activated. This is referred to as its trigger date. On this**
date, the system invokes the algorithm associated with the lead event to execute the event or action. A user may complete a
pending event at their discretion.

**Cancelled state: A pending event will be cancelled automatically by the system when a lead is canceled. A user may cancel**
a pending event at their discretion.

Refer to Maintaining Lead Events for more information.


-----

###### The Lifecycle of a Third Party Lead Event

The following diagram shows the possible lifecycle of a Third Party Lead Event business object:

**Pending state: Third party lead events are initially created in the Pending state. A third party lead event can take a number**
of paths after it is created; it all depends on how you’ve configured the system.

**In Progress state: A third party lead event contains a date when it should be activated. This is referred to as its trigger date.**
On this date, the system invokes the algorithm associated with the lead event to execute the event or action. The lead event
is set to In Progress and the lead event is sent to the third party representative.

**Complete state: A third party lead event may be completed based on updates received from the third party. In most cases,**
the third partly lead event is completed when all the event steps are complete. In addition, a user may complete an In
Progress event at their discretion.

**Cancelled state: A Pending or In Progress third party lead event will be cancelled automatically by the system when the**
lead is canceled. A user may cancel a Pending or In Progress event at their discretion.

Refer to Maintaining Third Party Lead Events for more information.

###### Lead Event Information Can Be Overridden

“Lead Event info” is the concatenated string of information that summarizes a lead event throughout the system. The basepackage logic constructs this string by concatenating the following information:

- Lead event type description

- Status of the lead event

- Trigger date of the lead event

If you'd prefer a different info string, you can develop a new algorithm and plug-it in on the Lead Event’s maintenance
object.


-----

###### Third Party Lead Event Step Information Can Be Overridden

The Initiative Leads zone on the Third Party Representative portal shows an event step information string for Last
**Complete Step and Next Pending Step. A base-package service script constructs this string by concatenating the following**
information:

- Step type description

- Intended Work Date/Time

- Completion Date/Time

You can override this by specifying an Override Step Information Script on the Program Management Master
Configuration.

See Program Management Master Configuration for more details.

###### How and When Lead Events Are Activated

A lead event contains the date it should be activated; this is referred to as its trigger date. On this date, the Lead Event
Periodic Monitor Process (a background process (C1-LDEVT)) invokes the algorithm associated with a lead event's event
type. The algorithm, in turn, will decide on the state in which to leave the lead event.

If a user can't wait for the Lead Event Periodic Monitor Process real-time, they can click a button on Lead Event – Main to
activate / trigger an event online in real-time. Refer to Maintaining Lead Events for more information.

You control how a lead event's trigger date is populated by configuring the Lead Event Type profile in an initiative. You
indicate the number of days the lead event should be activated after the creation of the lead. Refer to Maintaining Initiatives
for more information.

###### Activating Events Should Add a Log Entry

As described previously, a lead and lead event have a log holding a history of meaningful events in their lives. Most
algorithms associated with a lead event's event type will add an entry to both the lead and lead event logs.

These log entries are more than just an audit trail as they also reference the objects that are created during execution. For
example, if an algorithm creates a customer contact, the ID of the customer contact will be referenced on the log (and endusers will be able to drill down on the log entry to see the customer contact).

###### How Lead Events Are Cancelled

A pending lead event will be cancelled automatically by the system when the lead is canceled.

A user may cancel a pending lead event at their discretion. Refer to Maintaining Lead Events for more information.

A third party representative can also initiate the cancellation of a lead event. Refer to The Lifecycle of a Third Party Lead
Event for more details.

###### The Big Picture of Sales Representatives

A sales representative is a group or individual who can be assigned to follow up and manage leads.

Individual sales representatives can be members of one or more groups, and they can be an internal user or an external
party.

Groups can be used to control which sales representatives are allocated to the leads for an initiative. For example, you
can set up a group whose sales representatives are responsible for industrial customers. Initiatives that target industrial


-----

customers can then be configured so that this group is specified as the only one whose sales representatives can be assigned
the initiative’s leads.

Because many reports will aggregate information for all sales representatives in a group, you may choose to set up a sales
representative group just for reporting purposes.

The topics in this section provide additional information about Sales Representatives.

###### The Lifecycle of a Sales Representative

The following diagram shows the possible lifecycle of a Sales Representative:

**Active state: A Sales Representative starts out in an active state.**

**Inactive state: A Sales Representative may be transitioned manually by a user to the inactive state when they want to**
deactivate the Sales Representative either temporarily or permanently. A user can manually place the Sales Representative
back to the active state from the inactive state.

Refer to Maintaining Sales Representatives for more information.

###### Sales Representative Log

Every Sales Representative has a log holding its history. Entries are added to the log when meaningful events occur, for
example:

- When a Sales Representative is created

- When a Sales Representative’s status changes (e.g. transitions to the inactive state)

- Users can manually add log entries (you might want to think of these as "diary" entries) as desired.

###### The Big Picture of Third Party Representatives

A third party representative is similar to a sales representative except that they are typically not internal employees and they
have a different set of responsibilities.


-----

Lead-related tasks may be outsourced to a third party representative who is better equipped to perform the work. These
tasks may include pre-installation visits, energy audits, equipment installation, and equipment recycling. An initiative’s lead
event type profile defines whether or not lead-related work is sent to a third party representative.

Work is typically sent to a third party representative when a customer signs up for an initiative. The base product provides
an online Sign Up action on active leads. This action creates a Third Party Lead Event that triggers the third party
notification.

The third party representative is also responsible for providing updates to the system about the assigned leads. These
updates can include event status updates, updates to important date/time information (e.g., completion date/time) and
comments. This feedback enables users of the system to monitor the progress of leads and provide any necessary customer
service.

Refer to the The Lifecycle of a Third Party Lead Event for more details on third party lead events.

The topics in this section provide additional information about Third Party Representatives.

###### The Lifecycle of a Third Party Representative

The following diagram shows the possible lifecycle of a Third Party Representative:

**Active state: A Third Party Representative starts out in an active state.**

**Inactive state: A Third Party Representative may be transitioned manually by a user to the inactive state when they want**
to deactivate the Third Party Representative either temporarily or permanently. A user can manually place the Third Party
Representative back to the active state from the inactive state.

Refer to Maintaining Third Party Representatives for more information.

###### Third Party Representative Log

Every Third Party Representative has a log holding its history. Entries are added to the log when meaningful events occur,
for example:

- When a Third Party Representative is created.


-----

- When a Third Party Representative’s status changes (e.g. transitions to the inactive state).

- Users can manually add log entries as desired.

###### Maintaining Initiatives

An initiative defines a structured campaign that outlines the efforts to encourage customers to participate in a program
targeted at a specific market segment.

Refer to The Big Picture of Initiatives for more information about initiatives.

###### Initiative Portal

You use the Initiative portal to maintain initiatives.

The Main page contains the following zones:

- **Initiative: Displays the basic information about the initiative.**

- **Initiative Eligibility Criteria Overview: Displays initiative eligibility criteria associated with the initiative.**

- **Related Object Criteria Overview: Displays criteria for finding one or more related objects (such as, a premise) to link**
to a lead.

- **Initiative Hierarchy: Displays the entire hierarchy of initiatives that the selected initiative is a part of.**

- **Initiative Leads: Displays the leads that are associated with the initiative.**

- **Lead Processing: Allows you to submit the lead generation or lead disposition batch process.**

The Statistics page contains the following

- **Lead Summary by Representative: Displays the summary of leads for the initiative hierarchy, grouped by**
representatives.

- **Initiative Leads: Displays the leads that are associated with the initiative.**

- **Lead Outcome Graph: Displays the number of leads linked to the initiative hierarchy that entered the final state within**
the last 24 months.

- **Lead Statistics: Displays statistics for the leads associated with the initiative.**

- **Lead Monthly Statistics: Displays statistics for the leads associated with the initiative on a monthly basis.**

- **Unassigned Leads: Displays leads that are not yet assigned to a sales representative and are not in a final state. (Note:**
Leads can be assigned to a sales representative in bulk.)

###### How To Perform Common Initiative Functions

The topics in this section describe how to perform common initiative functions from the Initiative portal.

###### Creating Initiatives

Use this procedure to create a new Initiative.

**1. Select Menu > Sales & Marketing > Initiative > Add.**

**2. Select the business object that will define the initiative and click OK.**

**3. Enter the initiative’s name, (short) description, detailed description, start date, and end date.**

**4. Specify if the initiative is a master or a subsidiary initiative.**


-----

**a) If the initiative is a Subsidiary Initiative, search for and select the initiative that is the parent to this initiative.**

**5. Specify whether the master initiative will participate in demand-side analytics processing through Contract Option**
Participation Analysis.

**6. Specify whether or not leads can be generated for the initiative.**

**a) If leads can be generated, complete the options regarding communication channel and related object creation.**

**7. In the Third Party Notification section, specify the Lead Event Type to use to notify a third party. This lead event type**
is used when creating a third party notification lead event, if applicable, when a customer signs up or enrolls into a
program.

**8. In the Lead Reassignment Notification section, indicate how the system should respond if a lead is reassigned to another**
sales representative.

**9. In the Statistics Notification section, specify how often, in hours, the statistics for the initiative should be updated.**

A background process accumulates the statistics for an initiative when enough time has elapsed since the statistics were
last updated. A user may also manually initiate the process to update the statistics for an initiative.

**10. If this initiative will have leads, add lead event types in the Lead Event Type Profile section to define the events or**
actions that will occur during the lifetime of the lead to encourage the customer to participate in the initiative. To add
lead event types in the Lead Event Type Profile section:

**a) Assign an Event Sequence to each list entry.**

**b) Search for and select a Lead Event Type to indicate the type of lead event to generate for each list entry (for**
example send customer an email or create a customer contact).

**c) Specify the number of Days After Lead Creation that the related lead event will be triggered.**

**11. Click Save.**

###### Maintaining an Initiative

#### Rates

When you set up a customer in the system, you create a service agreement for every service that the customer uses. The
most important information specified on a service agreement is the rate. The rate controls:


-----

- How the service's charges are calculated.

- How the charges are described on the customer's bills.

- How the general ledger is affected by the charges.

It's important to understand that while most service agreements are associated to a rate, you may have service agreements
that don't use a rate to calculate their charges; for example, you may have billable charge service agreements to bill a
customer for charges that have been calculated in an external system. Whether or not a service agreement uses a rate and the
list of rates that can be specified on a service agreement are controlled by the service agreement's SA Type.

In addition to calculating charges for service, your implementation can also use rates to calculate adjustments.

**FASTPATH:**
Refer to How Rates Affect The Information On A Bill for how billing uses the information in a rate to calculate a bill
segment. Refer to Calculated Adjustments for how to use a rate to calculate an adjustment.

**NOTE:**
Do not equate a rate in your legacy system with a rate in this system. You may find that the system's flexibility will
result in fewer rates than you have today. For example, your current rate structure may have three rates for service
because there are different prices based on the customer’s geographic area. In this system, however, you can set up a
single rate and vary the price based on where the customer lives.

This chapter describes the structure and process to configure rates.

**NOTE:**
If you’re using Oracle Utilities Rate Cloud Service, refer to the Oracle Utilities Rate Cloud Service chapter in the
_Business User Guide, and the Defining Oracle Utilities Rate Cloud Service Options chapter in the Administrative User_
_Guide for information about how the rate functionality works in the context of that cloud service._

Rate schedules created using the new rate engine are referred to as Calculation Rule-Based Rates or, simply, Rates; and
those created using the original rate engine are referred to as Component-Based Rates. This chapter focuses on Calculation
Rule-Based Rates, unless stated otherwise.

**CAUTION:**
Component-Based Rates, or classic rates, is not the recommended approach for new implementations. ComponentBased Rates is intended for upgrading customers who currently use this rate structure and have not converted to
Calculation Rule-Based Rates.

##### Calculation Rule-Based Rates

Calculation Rule-Based Rates (Rates) offer a flexible and reusable structure to calculate charges, centralize configuration,
and reduce your development effort and time.

This chapter describes the structure and process to configure Rates.

###### All Calculation Rule-Based Rates Share a Common Structure

The basic components used to calculate charges are Calculation Rules. Each calculation rule is configured to perform
a specific type of calculation, such as calculating tax charges, the number of days in a billing period, or the amount of
consumption used by a customer in a billing period.


-----

Calculation rules are organized into Calculation Groups, which are logical collections of calculation rules that can be
referenced by rate schedules. Calculation rules and groups are commonly "generic" and can be applied to multiple rates.

Furthermore, calculation groups can be nested within other calculation rules. When the parent rule is processed, it executes
all the rules that are nested in its referenced group. This strategy allows a single rule to execute any number of nested rules.
Nesting also allows common calculations to be encapsulated into a set of calculation rules that can be included in multiple
rates.

Calculation groups are defined for a rate schedule in one of three ways:

- **Pre-Processing Calculation Groups perform initial calculations in preparation for the rate version calculation group.**

- **Rate Version Calculation Groups are effective-dated calculation groups that perform the main calculations of the rate**
schedule.

- **Post-Processing Calculation Groups perform calculations after rate version calculation groups are executed.**

See About Calculation Groups for more information.

At the highest level, every rate has a single rate schedule that contains basic information that shouldn’t change over time;
such as, the billing frequency, currency, and the rate’s proration strategy. This information combined with the calculations
groups, and other high-level configuration, comprise the Rate Schedule

###### Control Tables That Must Be Set Up Before Creating a Rate Schedule

This section describes tables that must be set up before you can add a rate schedule.

###### Master Configuration

The Rate Engine Configuration master configuration can be used to define the behavior of the Rate Schedule portals used
when creating rate schedules.

To edit this master configuration, select Admin > Master Configuration, and click the edit icon for the Rate Engine
**Configuration.**

The Rate Engine Implementation dropdown list defines which rate engine(s) will be used by your organization.

- **Calculation-Rule Based indicates that your implementation uses calculation rule-based rates, which require the**
configuration of rate schedules with calculation groups and calculation rules.

- **Component-Based indicates that your implementation uses component-based rates, which require the configuration of**
rate versions with rate components, and rate schedules with SQ and register rules.

- **Both indicates that your implementation uses both rate engines. If this applies to you, then the system will use this option**
to ease navigation as follows:

  - Select Menu > Rates > Rate Schedule > Add to launch the page to add a new rate schedule. (A hyperlink is
_included to take the user to the component-based rate schedule maintenance page, if necessary.)_

  - Select Menu > Rates > Rate Schedule > Search to launch the Rate Schedule Query portal.

  - The query results attempt to highlight component-based rates by appending “(Component-Based)” to the rate
schedule's description.

  - Once a rate schedule is selected from the result set, the system navigates the user to either the calculation rule-based
**Rate Schedule portal or the component-based Rate Schedule page.**

The External Communication section is used when the rate engine needs to communicate with an external system. For
example, service quantities are needed to test a rate on the Rate Check portal. These service quantities may be entered on
the portal, retrieved from an existing bill segment, or (in the case of a service agreement that requires bill determinants)
request service quantities from Oracle Utilities Meter Data Management.


-----

- **Request Type identifies the various data requests that can be made to an external system. Request types are defined in**
the RATE_EXT_REQ_TYPE_FLG lookup field. To introduce additional request types, add appropriate lookup values to
this lookup field for each request type you wish to support.

The base package includes the following business objects to be defined on the outbound message types created for such
requests:

  - **Rate Check Usage: C1-UsageRequestOutMsg (used to request bill determinants from MDM on the rate check portal)**

- **External System and Outbound Message Type are used when creating the outbound message for the data request.**

###### Defining Frequency Codes

When you create a rate schedule, you must enter a code defining the frequency in which the prices are expressed, e.g.,
monthly, quarterly, biannual, etc. To set up frequency codes, open Admin > Rates > Frequency.

**Description of Page**

Enter a unique Frequency ID and Description for each frequency.

Before entering the remaining fields, you must analyze the "proration provisions" in your rates. For example, consider a
rate used to calculate charges for a "month's worth of service". Assume this rate's charges will not be prorated when the
customer's service period is anywhere between 27 and 33 days. This rate requires a frequency that indicates:

- 12 Periods / Year (because it's a monthly rate).

- **MinimumDays Offset equal to 3.**

- **MaximumDays Offset equal to 3.**

When the system creates a bill using a rate with this frequency, it compares the number of days of consumption on the bill
to the minimum and maximum number of days inferred by the rate's frequency. In the example above, the minimum number
of days would be 27 (365 days / 12 period per year - 3 offset for minimum days). The maximum number of days would be
33 (365 days / 12 periods per year + 3 offset for maximum days). Therefore, if a bill's consumption period is less than 27
days or more than 33 days, the bill's charges are prorated.

**NOTE:**
**Overriding the system's standard proration logic. If the standard proration logic does not satisfy your requirements,**
you may plug in an override proration algorithm to calculate the proration factors as required by your implementation.
For example, we have encountered companies who treat a year has have 360 days rather than 365 days. Such a company
would need to develop an override proration algorithm and plug it on the Installation record.

**Where Used**

Every Rate Schedule must have a frequency. Refer to Defining Rate Schedules for more information.

###### Setting Up Bill Factors

This section describes bill factors and how they are used to levy the many charges referenced in a rate.

**WARNING:**
Most bill factors exist to support calculations performed by calculation rules. This means that you must design your
calculation rules before you can design your bill factors. We strongly recommend that you design "on paper" how each
rate's calculation rules look before attempting to set up bill factors.


-----

###### An Overview of Bill Factors

The primary reason that calculation rules exist is to define how much to charge for the services sold by your company.
When you create calculation rules, you have four ways to indicate how much to charge:

- Specify the value directly in the calculation rule.

- Define that the value is defined in a bill factor.

- Define that the value is calculated by a for calculation purposes only calculation rule.

- Tell the calculation rule to call an algorithm to get the price.

The remainder of this section describes the bill factor approach. The other methods are discussed in Case Study: Three
Simple Rates .

Bill factors are used to pass a value to a calculation rule; such as specifying a tax rate. To further illustrate this, you could
specify the current tax rate, say 6%, directly in every rate's calculation rules OR you could indicate every rate should
levy the current state tax rate and have the system look up the applicable rate when it calculates bills. The latter approach
involves using a bill factor to indicate that the amount to charge should be retrieved from someplace other than the
calculation rule when a bill is calculated.

You can use bill factors to define any of the following types of charges:

- A flat amount. This would typically be used to define service charges, minimum charges, and asset charges.

- An amount for a given unit of measure. This would typically be used to define the price for measured consumption (such
as, the price per therm).

- A percentage. This would typically be used for tax rates and discount percents.

As a rule of thumb, you would use a bill factor (rather than specify the value in the calculation rule) when any of the
following situations exist:

- The same charge exists in many rates. For example, if there are three rates that all contain the same service charge, it
would make sense to use a bill factor to levy this charge rather than specify the same value on three calculation rules.

- The amount being charged is dependent upon some physical characteristic of the customer's equipment. For example,
if the price differs depending on whether the customer owns the transformer, you would use a bill factor to specify the
price.

- The amount being charged is dictated by some external organization and therefore can change independently from the
rate. For example, tax percentages and use fees are set by taxing authorities and can be changed at any time (and you
don't want to change the rate when these charges change).

- The amount being charged varies depending on WHERE the customer lives. If you have a rate where the price per gallon
differs depending on where the customer lives, you should use a bill factor to levy this type of charge.

- A charge (or discount) is only levied for a subset of customers for defined periods of time. For example, if you have a
discount that is only given to customers who have had service for more than two years, you would use a bill factor to
specify the discount percent.

- The price differs per customer. For example, you may have a rate for large gas customers where the price per therm is
different for every customer. In this situation, you would use a bill factor to specify the price.

- The price differs based on the number of weeks of consumption. This typically occurs in a deregulated environment
when the price charge is based on the weighted average spot market price in effect during the bill period.

**WARNING:**
As you can deduce, bill factors are extremely flexible. While the flexibility makes for a very powerful rate engine, it also
presents you a dizzying array of options. We have discovered that to take advantage of the flexibility, you need to gain


-----

an overall understanding of the pricing and taxation provisions in ALL of your rates. Only then can you make logical
and pragmatic decisions in respect of the number and type of bill factors.

###### The Structure of a Bill Factor

All bill factors share a common structure as illustrated below:

The above example shows a standard bill factor, which is made up of the following tables:

- **Bill Factor. A bill factor contains descriptive information and attributes that control how the bill factor may be used in**
the system.

- **Bill Factor Characteristic. All bill factors have the capability of having different values depending on some**
characteristic of the premise or service point. For example, a bill factor used to levy a state tax would have a different
tax rate depending on the state in which the customer resides. A bill factor characteristic must exist for every state with
a tax (states without a tax will not be linked to the state tax bill factor). At billing time, if the system cannot find a bill
factor characteristic that corresponds with the customer's state of residence, the charge will be skipped.

- **Bill Factor Value. Each bill factor characteristic may have many bill factor values over time. To continue with our state**
tax example, each state with a tax can have different tax rates over time. There are different ways in which a bill factor's
values may be defined:

  - For bill factors whose values are applicable to many customers where only one value is effective on a given date
(such as, a city tax) the values are defined using bill factor values. Refer to Defining Bill Factor Values for more
information.

  - For bill factors whose value differs per customer, the value is defined in the customer's service agreement. Refer to
Service Agreement - Contract Value for more information about bill factors in contract terms.

  - For bill factors whose values are applicable to many customers where more than one value is effective on a given
date (such as, an interval price or a weighted average price) the values are defined on an interval value set. Refer to
Defining Interval Values for more information about interval value sets.

###### An Illustration of a Bill Factor and Its Characteristics

The following picture illustrates how a bill factor and its characteristics are used to retrieve the relevant state tax at billing
time:


-----

The following points describe the illustration:

- At billing time, the billing engine sends a request to a rate to calculate the charges for a customer's consumption.

- The rate calculates charges without bill factors until it encounters the calculation rule that levies state tax. This
calculation rule references a bill factor. This means the rate must get the tax rate(s) in effect during the billing period
from this bill factor.

- The state tax bill factor contains an attribute defining that the premise's taxing state characteristic controls the bill factor
value. The bill factor therefore extracts the taxing state from the premise.

**NOTE:**
**Deriving characteristic values. Rather than have the system extract the characteristic value from an entity, you can**
setup the system to derive the characteristic value when the rate is calculated. For example, if all of your customers
are located in a single state, you may not want to maintain the taxing state on every premise. To do this, you could
setup the rate to "hard code" a taxing state of say Hawaii. This is an advanced topic, but it may prove useful for your
implementation. Refer to Deriving / Passing In Characteristic Values for the details.

- The premise returns the taxing state and the bill factor extracts the tax rate(s) in effect during the bill period and returns
them to the rate.

- The rate applies the tax percents and returns the charges to billing.

**NOTE:**
**Some bill factors don't need a characteristic. There are bill factors whose value does not differ based on a**
characteristic. For example, if your organization offers employee discounts, the discount percent is probably the same


-----

for all employees and therefore this bill factor doesn't need a characteristic to select the bill factor value at billing time.
However, because of the relational design of the system, every bill factor value must reference both a bill factor and a
characteristic value. Therefore, if you have bill factors whose value is not related to a characteristic, you must specify a
characteristic type on the bill factor with a characteristic value that is exactly the same as the characteristic type.

**FASTPATH:**
For more information about setting up characteristics, see Setting Up Characteristic Types and Their Values .

###### Deriving/Passing In Characteristic Values

In An Illustration of a Bill Factor and Its Characteristics, we described how the system retrieves a characteristic value from
a premise when a bill factor is encountered that uses a premise characteristic. This is a very common technique and is easy
to understand. However, there are situations when an entity in Oracle Utilities Customer Care and Billing doesn't contain
the appropriate characteristic value and therefore other techniques must be used. These techniques may not apply to your
implementation, but they're worth understanding to help you form an intuitive understanding of rate application:

- There are implementations that only use the Oracle Utilities Customer Care and Billing rate engine. These
implementations do not setup accounts, premises, etc. Rather, they simply setup their rate schedules, calculation rules,
and bill factors. The rate engine is called from another application. This means the rate engine can't retrieve characteristic
values from within Oracle Utilities Customer Care and Billing (because there are no objects where the characteristic
values are defined). In this situation, the application that calls the rate engine must supply the characteristic types and
values to be used when a bill factor requires this type of information.

- Assume you have a charge that is based on the account's customer class and the service agreement's revenue class. The
characteristic value for this type of charge is not extractable through a single entity. Rather, the system must construct
the characteristic value in real-time by concatenating information from the account and service agreement that is being
billed. In this situation, you can use pre-processing calculation group to derive this characteristic type and value. This
calculation group would create a characteristic type and value in real time by concatenating the account's customer
class and the service agreement's revenue class. This characteristic type and value only exists in memory while the rate
application executes.

When you setup a bill factor to use a characteristic whose value is derived or passed in, you need to define its characteristic
source as Characteristics Collection. This source tells the system to extract the characteristic value from memory rather than
extracting it from an object within the system.

**NOTE:**
The plug-in spots on a calculation rule have access to the Characteristics Collection. You might find this useful if you
have a calculation rule that needs to calculate characteristic values for subsequent calculation rules.

###### Defining Bill Factors

You create a bill factor for every type of charge whose value is not specified directly in a calculation rule.

It is recommended to use two windows to set up a bill factor. On the first, you define general information describing how
the bill factor is used in the system. On the second, you define all the characteristic values for the bill factor.

###### Defining General Bill Factor Information

Begin to define a bill factor by selecting Menu > Rates > Bill Factor > Add.


-----

**Description of Page**

Enter a unique Bill Factor code and a Description for the bill factor.

Use Bill Factor Type to indicate if this bill factor uses Regular, Interval (i.e., real-time), or Time of Use values.

- **Regular. Indicates that this bill factor's values are specified on Bill Factor Value - Main or on Service Agreement -**
Contract Values.

- **Interval. Indicates that this bill factor's values are specified on Defining Interval Values**

- **Time of Use. Indicates that this bill factor's values are specified on Bill Factor TOU Values or on SA Interval Billing**
Info - TOU Contract Values (Note: This option is only applicable to Conponent-Based Rates).

Enter a Currency Code to define the bill factor's denomination, or currency. This field is disabled if the bill factor is
referenced on a calculation rule.

**NOTE:**
Bill factors referenced on a calculation rules must be denominated in the same currency as is the rate.

Select the Value Type to define the kind of value maintained by this bill factor. The Value Type options are:

- **Charge. The value maintained in this bill factor is a fixed amount (e.g., a flat charge).**

- **Percentage. The value maintained in this bill factor is a percentage.**

- **Unit Rate. The value maintained in the bill factor is a price per service quantity.**

This field is disabled if the bill factor is already referenced on a calculation rule or if the bill factor already has values

Turn on Error If No Value if the system should create a billing error when a bill factor value doesn't exist for the
characteristic value linked to the customer. To clarify, understand that there are different types of bill factors:

- Those that should have a value for every customer whose rate references the bill factor. A bill factor used to levy the
relevant state tax is a good example (assuming every state has a tax). For this type of bill factor, if the system cannot find
a bill factor value for the taxing state, it must generate a billing error because data is missing from the system. You would
turn on Error if No Value for this type of bill factor.

- Those that only have a value when the customer has a characteristic value that levies a charge. A bill factor used to levy
the relevant city tax is a good example (because not all cities levy taxes). For this type of bill factor, if the system cannot
find a bill factor value for the city in which the customer lives, the calculation rule will be skipped and no billing error
will be generated. You would turn off Error if No Value for this type of bill factor

Bill factors used to levy taxes may or may not be eligible for tax exemptions; it's up to the respective taxing authority.
Customers who are eligible for the tax exemption will have their tax obligation reduced (or nullified) at billing time. For
bill factors that are eligible for tax exemptions, turn on Tax Exemption. If a service agreement is fully or partially exempt
for the taxes defined by a given bill factor, the bill factor and the exemption information for the customer must be indicated
on the Service Agreement page. This field will be disabled if the bill factor is referenced as being tax exempt in a service
agreement.

**FASTPATH:**
For more information about how to make a customer tax exempt, refer to Service Agreement - Tax Exemptions.

Some types of bill factors do not have the same value for all customers. Rather, their value may be unique for every
customer or it may be unique for some customers and common for others. For example, you may have rates where the price
per kilowatt-hour is defined for every customer using the rate. You may have other rates where certain customers have their
own price per kilowatt-hour defined and other customers who use the value defined on the bill factor. For any type of bill
factor where a customer may have their own unique price, turn on Value In Contract Term. For any service agreement
that has a unique value for a given bill factor, the bill factor and the service agreement's value must be indicated on the
Service Agreement page. When applying the rate for a bill factor of this type, the system will first check for the existence of


-----

a contract value for the service agreement and if one is not found, it will use the value on the bill factor. This field will be
disabled if a contract term referencing this bill factor exists.

**NOTE:**
The Error if No Value switch also affects what happens if there is no contract term for the bill factor. If the error switch
is on, a billing error will be generated. If the error switch is off, no billing error will be generated and the calculation rule
will be skipped.

**FASTPATH:**
For more information about how to specify a bill factor value in a customer's contract, refer to Service Agreement - Rate
Info.

Contract riders are used when the charge associated with the bill factor is only applicable to some customers for some
period of time. For example, if a bill factor is used to provide a discount during the first 3 months of service, then a contract
rider would be used. Turn on Contract Rider Applicability if the bill factor's applicability is contingent on the existence of
a contract rider. This field will be gray if a contract rider referencing this bill factor exists on a service agreement.

**FASTPATH:**
For more information about how to establish a contract rider for a customer, refer to Service Agreement - Contract
Riders.

The proration information tells the system how to handle changes to bill factor values and their optional contract riders that
may occur during a customer's bill period. Turn on Allow Proration if changes to the bill factor's value and/or contract
riders should be prorated. If the Bill Factor Type is not specified as Interval and if changes should not be prorated, indicate
the Rate Selection Date Algorithm to use when the system retrieves bill factor values or determines if contract riders are
applicable.

If you have sub service agreements, turn on Use Sub SA Contract terms if billing should access contract riders, values, tax
exemptions from the sub SA rather than the master. If this switch is off, the system will use the master SA's riders, contract
value, and tax exemptions when it creates bills for a sub service agreement. Refer to Sub Service Agreements for more
information.

If the Contract Management module is not turned off, which includes umbrella agreement management, and you have
checked either Tax Exemption, Value in Contract Term or Contract Rider Availability, indicate the Terms of Service
**Usage. Valid values are Check SA Only, Check TOS Only and Check TOS First, then SA. Refer to Overriding Rate Terms**
for details about how to set this value based on your business needs.

**Bill Factor Tree**

The right half of this page is dedicated to a tree that shows the bill factors characteristics and their respective values
(for Regular bill factors) or interval value Sets (for Interval bill factors). You can use this tree to both view high level
information about these objects and to transfer to the respective page in which an object is maintained by using the available
Go To buttons.

**Where Used**

Many types of Rate Components may use a Bill Factor to define the price being charged. Refer to Designing Calculation
Groups and Rules for more information.

The BILPC-TOTAL algorithm type that is used to levy late payment charges references the bill factor that defines the late
payment charge percent. Refer to SA Type - Main for more information about this algorithm.

A Service Agreement references Bill Factors as follows:

- When a service agreement's Apply To calculation rule references tax exemptable bill factors AND the customer is
tax exempt, the service agreement will define the bill factors from which the customer is exempt. Refer to Service
Agreement - Tax Exemptions for more information.


-----

- When a service agreement's rate references bill factors whose prices are customer-specific (i.e., specified on a contract
term), the service agreement will contain prices for these bill factors. Refer to Service Agreement - Contract Values for
more information.

- When a service agreement's rate references bill factors that are contingent on contract riders, the service agreement will
define the rider period (if any) for these bill factors. Refer to Service Agreement - Contract Riders for more information.

###### Setting Up Bill Factor Characteristics

After defining general information about a bill factor, open Menu > Rates > Bill Factor > Search and navigate to the Bill
**Factor Characteristics page to define characteristic values where applicable. For example, a bill factor used to levy the**
applicable city tax would require the definition of every city that levies a tax.

**NOTE:**
If all values for a bill factor are specified in contract terms, you do not need to set up Bill Factor Characteristics.

**Description of Page**

Enter a Characteristic Type to indicate the type of characteristic that controls how the bill factor's value is defined. This
field will be disabled if Bill Factor Characteristics are specified in the following grid.

The Characteristic Source defines where the system retrieves the characteristic value at billing time. The Characteristic
Source options are:

Account The characteristic type's value will be retrieved from the service

agreement's account.

Characteristic Collection Refer to Deriving / Passing In Characteristic Values for an explanation

of this value.

Main Person The characteristic type's value will be retrieved from the main person

linked to the service agreement's account.

N/A The characteristic type's value is the same for all customers using the

rate. If this option is used, you must still choose a Characteristic Type.

This Characteristic Type should have a single Characteristic Value.

The ID of the characteristic value must be identical to the ID of the

characteristic type.

Premise The characteristic type's value will be retrieved from the service

agreement's characteristic premise.

SA The characteristic type's value will be retrieved from the service

agreement.

SP The characteristic type's value will be retrieved from the customer's

service point. If multiple service points are linked to the service

agreement, one will be chosen at random.

**FASTPATH:**
For more information about characteristics, see Setting Up Characteristic Types and Their Values and An Illustration Of
A Bill Factor And Its Characteristics.

Use the add and remove buttons to define the Characteristic Values that are relevant for the bill factor's Characteristic
Type. For example, if the bill factor is used to levy a city tax, you would define the city's that have a city tax in the above
collection.


-----

Use the Minutes Per Interval if your Bill Factor is of type Interval. This defines, for each characteristic value, the number
of minutes expected between each record of interval data.

Use the External ID if the values for this characteristic are interfaced to the system from an external source and you want to
record an identifier for the source.

**NOTE:**
If the bill factor's value is the same for all customers, you still must link a "dummy" characteristic value to the bill
factor. In other words, you'll have to create a characteristic type called "n/a" and define for it a characteristic value
of "n/a". Then, on the bill factor, you reference the "n/a" characteristic type and on the above window, you indicate a
characteristic value of "n/a".

###### Defining Bill Factor Values

After the bill factor and its characteristic values are defined, you define the price / percent and GL distribution associated
with each bill factor characteristic. The topics in this section describe the pages used to set up this information.

###### Bill Factor Value - Main

After the bill factor and its characteristic values are defined, select Menu > Rates > Bill Factor Value to define the price /
percent applicable to each bill factor characteristic.

**IMPORTANT:**
You do not set up Bill Factor Values for bill factors whose values are specified in an interval value data set or if all the
values are customer specific and are defined as contract terms. Refer to Defining Interval Values for more information
about interval value sets. Refer to Service Agreement - Contract Value for more information about bill factors in
contract terms.

**Description of Page**

Enter the Effective Date and respective Value for the bill factor and characteristic value. The first date should be the
earliest date on which the bill factor's charges are effective. Subsequent effective dates and values are required whenever the
value changes.

**NOTE:**
**Default note. A Value of 0, zero, will be defaulted.**

###### Bill Factor Value - GL Distribution

Select Menu > Rates > Bill Factor Value and navigate to the GL Distribution page to define the GL account affected by
the bill factor characteristic.

**Description of Page**

If the bill factor characteristic's charges are booked to a different GL account depending on the characteristic value, specify
the appropriate DistributionCode for each Revenue Class.

**IMPORTANT:**


-----

Specifying distribution codes on a bill factor is optional. You would only do this if the GL distribution code differs
based on the characteristic value (such as, the city tax payable GL account differs depending on the city). If you do not
enter the above information, the distribution code will be used.

The GL distribution code on the bill factor’s value will not be used in the following cases:

  - Value derived solely on contract value or contract value in combination with contract rider and/or tax exemption,
where characteristic value is no longer used to determine the bill factor value.

  - Value derived in calculate service quantity and math calculation rules where multiple bill factors may be configured
in the rule resulting to multiple values contributing to the calculation of the line amount.

###### Rate Schedule Execution

When a rate schedule is executed, the system executes the calculation rules contained in the calculation groups defined for
the rate schedule as follows:

1. First, the system executes the calculation rules defined within Pre-Processing Calculation Groups.

- The rate engine may a bill segment calculation header for pre-processing calculations, if bill calculation lines are to be
created.

- Calculation groups are executed in order according to the Sequence defined on the rate schedule.

- Calculation rules within each group are executed according to the Sequence configured within the group.

2. Next, the system executes the calculation rules within the Rate Version Calculation Groups. The system uses the
Effective Date on each calculation group to determine which group(s) to execute. If more than one version of a calculation
group is in effect during the billing period, the system may prorate the calculations, based on the configuration of the rate
schedule.

- The rate engine creates a separate bill segment calculation header for each rate version calculation group.

- Calculation rules within each group are executed according to the Sequence configured within the group.

3. Finally, the system executes the calculation rules defined within Post-Processing Calculation Groups.

- The rate engine creates a separate bill segment calculation header for post-processing calculations.

- Calculation groups are executed in order according to the Sequence defined on the rate schedule.

- Calculation rules within each group are executed according to the Sequence configured within the group.

**Additional Information.**

- After every rate version calculation group is processed, the rate application returns the calculation details to the process
that called it. This point is important as it means that rate application executes in memory (i.e., it does NOT insert the
calculation details on the database, rather, it returns them to whatever process called rate application). Because rate
application executes in memory, it can be used to perform billing calculations in many parts of the system. For example:

- Both online and batch billing use rate application to calculate the charges that are eventually saved on the bill's bill
segments.

- The Rate Check transaction calls rate application when you want to check a rate real-time. When you use this
transaction, you enter the consumption that's passed into rate application and then rate application shows you the
calculation details that result.

- Plug-ins exist that call rate application to estimate bill segments when adequate billing history doesn't exist. For example,
the BUDCALC-PH budget recommendation algorithm calls rate application to calculate a budget amount for a customer
without adequate history. Another example is the DEPRECOM-MBT deposit recommendation algorithm. This plug-in
calls rate application to calculate a recommended deposit amount for a customer without adequate history.

###### Understanding Calculation Groups and Rules

This section provides descriptions of calculation groups and calculation rules, and describes how to identify components of
rates that can be defined using calculation rules and groups.

###### About Calculation Groups and Rules

This section includes descriptions of calculation groups and calculation rules.

###### About Calculation Groups

Calculation groups are collections of calculation rules that are applied to calculate quantities for billing and billing charges
for service agreements.

As noted previously, calculation groups are associated with specific rate schedules in one of three ways:

- **Pre-Processing Calculation Groups: These are generally used to derive service quantities or massage measured**
quantities. The following illustrate some use cases of when a pre-processing calculation group might be needed:

  - When a rate contains prices for things that aren't measured directly by the customers' meters. For example, if the rate
calculates a charge based on a service agreement's contracted quantity.

  - When a meter measures something in a unit of measure that has to be converted into a different unit of measure before
it can be rated. For example, a meter measures gas in cubic feet, but the rate contains prices in therms.
During billing, a separate bill segment calculation header is produced for each Rate Version Calculation Group
used to calculate charges. An additional calculation header is added if Pre-Processing Calculation Groups create
bill calculation lines and by default, all these calculation lines are linked to a single calculation header. Before
invoking the rate's Pre-Processing Calculation Groups, the rate engine processor builds the initial service quantity
(SQ) collection based on the item collection and final values in the read collection.

- **Rate Version Calculation Groups: These are the calculation groups used create a bill segment for the service**
agreement. Calculation rules that support rate version proration such as Service Quantity, Stepped Service Quantity, Item
Type, Flat Charge, Maximum and Minimum Charge, must be executed only in a rate version calculation group.
When the system creates a bill segment for a service agreement, it checks if multiple Rate Version Calculation Groups
are in effect during the bill period. If so, it uses the rate's Allow RV Proration and RV Selection Date values to
determine if it should prorate the various Rate Version Calculation Groups, or if it should pick one of the Rate Version
Calculation Groups effective during the bill period. Rate Version Calculation Groups are executed after the rate's preprocessing calculation groups.

  - **Effective Date: defines the date on which each rate version calculation group becomes effective.**

  - **Description on Bill: Specifies the description of the rate version calculation group on the bill. This description is**
saved on bill calculation details created using this rate version calculation group. Substitution characters may be used
to substitute variables into the description during billing. Refer to How To Use Description on Bill in the Defining
Calculation Rules chapter for a discussion of the various substitution variables.

- **Post-Processing Calculation Groups: These are similar to Pre-Processing Calculation Groups, except that these are**
executed after the Rate Version Calculation Groups. The intended types of functionality include applying taxes on
calculated charges, or deriving more complex GL distribution.
Calculation rules that support rate version proration such as Service Quantity, Stepped Service Quantity, Item Type, Flat
Charge, Maximum and Minimum Charge, are not designed to be executed in post and pre-processing calculation groups.

During billing, a separate bill segment calculation header is produced for each Rate Version Calculation Group used to
calculate charges. An additional calculation header is added if Post-Processing Calculation Groups create bill calculation
lines and by default, all these calculation lines are linked to a single calculation header.


-----

Calculation groups can also be referenced by "Execute Calculation Group" calculation rules. See "Execute Calculation
Group Rules - Nesting Calculation Rules" in About Calculation Rules for more information.

###### About Calculation Rules

Calculation rules are standard and custom rules that perform calculations used when calculating quantities for billing and
billing charges for a customer's service agreements.

Calculation rules are created for a specific calculation group. For example, if you were configuring two calculation groups
and both included a specific calculation rule, you would need to create two instances of the calculation rule, one for each
group.

Attributes used to define calculation rules typically include the following:

- **Basic Information: Basic information about the calculation rule, including its name and description, the calculation**
group to which the rule belongs, the sequence of the rule within the group, the description that appears on the bill, and
other information. This information is standard for most calculation rules.

- **Parameters: The parameters used by the rule. Parameters are specific to each rule. See Base Package Calculation Rule**
Descriptions for details about the calculation rules included with the base package.

###### Execute Calculation Group Rules - Nesting Calculation Rules

Execute Calculation Group rules are used to define business logic to allow reference to a separated specified calculation
group. This allows rules that are used frequently to be bunched under a single calculation group, which can be referenced /
called by other rules as needed. For example, if a set of standard rules should be applied to all rate schedules, this set of
rules can be configured as part of a calculation group, which is referenced by a single calculation rule of this type. Execute
Calculation Group rules use the following options:

- **Referred Calculation Group: defines the calculation group referenced by the rule.**

- **Characteristics: defines additional calculation rule attributes that may be used in rate processing or for reporting**
purposes. A calculation rule's characteristics are copied onto the resultant bill lines for those characteristic types that are
allowed on bill segment calculation lines.

**NOTE:** There is a limit of 99 calculation groups that can be called from a calculation group defined directly on a rate
schedule or via related child calculation groups when using Execute Calculation Group calculation rules.

###### Eligibility Criteria

Calculation rule eligibility criteria are user-definable conditions that could cause a given calculation rule to be applied or
skipped. This can involve the evaluation of some attribute of the service agreement, or service point, or something else
entirely.

A calculation rule can have multiple eligibility criteria for determining if the rule should be applied or skipped, based on a
user-defined sequence. Each eligibility criteria uses the following settings:

- **Criteria Comparison: defines the specific comparison for the criteria, based on the following:**

  - **Criteria Field Type: the means used to retrieve the value of the criteria field (algorithm, bill factor, calculation line,**
characteristic, contract quantity, service quantity, or historic service quantity)

  - **Comparison Operator: the operator used in the comparison**

  - **Comparison Value: a user-specified value to which the retrieved value is compared (using the comparison operator)**

- **Comparison Results: defines how the rule should behave, based on the results of the comparison defined under Criteria**
Comparison:

  - **If True: the action to take if the comparison is true**

  - **If False: the action to take if the comparison is false**


-----

  - **If Insufficient Data: the action to take if there is insufficient data to perform the comparison**

###### Calculation Line Category Types

Calculation line category types are used to establish connections between calculation rules. Calculation rules can specify a
member category and value to which they belong. When this same category and value are referenced as a "Target Category"
by other rules (the rule is applied to the results of rate version calculation rules (defined in the same rate schedule) that
belong to the category and value.

For example, calculation rules whose results are subject to taxes might belong to the "Subject to Tax" (TAXABLE)
category and "County Tax" value. Apply To calculation rules defined for the same rate schedule with a target category of
"Subject to Tax" and "County Tax" values are applied to "Subject to Tax" member rules.

Calculation Line Category Types are defined by the following:

- **Calculation Line Category Type: The unique identifier of a calculation line category type definition**

- **Description: The description of the calculation line category type.**

- **Category Values: The valid category values for the calculation line category type.**

###### Base Package Calculation Rules

Oracle Utilities Customer Care and Billing includes the following base package calculation rule types that can be used when
creating calculation rules:

- **Apply To: Used to create bill lines that levy charges based on amounts calculated on other bill lines.**

- **Calculate Final Reading Values: Used to determine the final values for readings based on user-defined UOM/TOU/**
SQI.

- **Calculate Service Quantity: Used to derive or calculate a service quantity that is eventually inserted into the bill**
segment SQ collection.

- **Copy Service Quantity From Master Bill Segment: Used to copy all the entries from the master bill segment SQ**
collection to the sub bill segment SQ collection.

- **Execute Calculation Group: Used to call and pass parameters to another calculation group.**

- **Flat Charge: Used to create bill lines that levy service charges and fees that aren't based on how much the customer**
uses.

- **Item Type: Used to create bill lines that levy charges based on the number and type of items used by a customer. The**
system keeps track of items on the service point(s) linked to the customer's service agreement.

- **Math: Used to derive interval data based on a formula, and apply TOU mappings and/or other operations to the derived**
data to calculate service quantities

- **Maximum Charge: Used to create bill lines that levy charges only when the sum of previously calculated lines is more**
than the maximum charge amount.

- **Minimum Charge: Used to create bill lines that levy charges only when the sum of previously calculated lines is less**
than the minimum charge amount.

- **Service Quantity: Used to create bill lines that levy charges based on some type of consumption.**

- **Simple Summary: Used to create a "subtotal" on the bill, by summarizing bill lines produced by other calculation rules**
in the same calculation group.

- **Stepped Service Quantity: Used to create bill lines that levy charges based on some type of consumption when different**
prices are applied to different ranges of consumption (for example, the first 50 kWh are $0.43 per kWh, anything in
excess of 50 kWh is charged at $0.71 per kWh)

- **Summary: Used to create a "subtotal" on the bill. It exists purely for reporting and informational purposes.**

See Base Package Calculation Rule Descriptions for details about each of these calculation rules.

###### Designing Calculation Groups and Rules

Before starting to design calculation groups and rules for your rates, please review the concepts outlines in the Designing
**Rate Components section in the Rates chapter. That section provides a good background for understanding how to break**
down rates into component pieces that can be modeled by calculation groups and rules.

This section provides guidelines for how to design and plan the calculation groups and rules you will need for your rates,
and provides a simple case study of how to define the calculation rules and groups you might use for a set of rates for a
small municipal electric company.

###### Analyzing Your Rates and Identifying Calculation Rules and Groups

One of the steps you will go through when implementing your rates is to look at the bill lines for your rates and ask yourself
what are the variables that cause each line's charges to be calculated the way they are. After you've determined all of the
potential bill lines you can start designing your calculation groups and rules. Typically, you create one calculation rule for
every line that can appear on the customer's bill. These rules can be grouped in different configurations based on how you
want your bills to appear and the needs of your implementation. Recall that bill segment calculation headers are created for
Pre-Processing, Rate Version, and Post-Processing calculation groups. In addition, most rules can be configured generate a
bill line.

###### Best Practices

When designing calculation groups and rules, the following general rules apply:

- **Pre-Processing Calculation Groups. Perform any initial processing or conversions that should occur before the rate**
version calculation group. This can include:

  - Calculating the number of days in a billing period (Calculate Service Quantity)

  - Calculating service quantities that are not measured (demand, kVa, etc.) (Calculate Final Reading Values, Calculate
Service Quantity, Math)

  - Validating that consumption is within tolerances set by the rate (residential limits, etc.) (Calculate Service Quantity,
with eligibility criteria)

- Calculations processed by calculation rules should be performed by Rate Version Calculation Groups. This includes
most charge calculations, including:

  - Charges based on service quantities (Service Quantity, Stepped Service Quantity)

  - Customer charges (Flat Charge)

  - Minimum/maximum charges (Minimum Charge, Maximum Charge)

  - Discounts (Apply To)

  - Taxes (Apply To)

  - Summaries (Summary, Simple Summary)

- Additional processing should be performed by Post-Processing Calculation Groups. This can include:

  - Allocating consumption/revenue (energy revenue vs. demand revenue) (Service Quantity)

###### Example Configurations

Let's look at a couple of different possible configurations for a simple electric rate that includes the following:

- Customer Charge

- Service Charge (price per kWh)


-----

- Minimum Charge

- Discount

This rate could be set up in the following ways:

- A single Rate Version calculation group that contains a calculation rule for each of the above

- A set of Rate Version calculation groups as follows:

  - A calculation group for "flat" charges, such as the Customer Charge

  - A calculation group for consumption-based charges (including the Service Charge and Minimum Charge).

  - A calculation group for discounts or other charges applied to the total of other charges (which would include the
Discount)

There are no hard and fast rules concerning how calculation rules should be grouped. How this is done should be based
on the specific needs of the implementation but it's a good idea to look for ways to keep your configuration simple for
maintenance and upkeep purposes. This includes changes to existing rates as well as adding/removing rates over time.

###### Reusing Calculation Rules

One of the steps you will go through when implementing your rates is to look at the bill lines for your rates and ask yourself
what are the variables that cause each line's charges to be calculated the way they are. After you've determined all of the
potential bill lines you can start designing your calculation groups and rules. Typically, you create one calculation rule for
every line that can appear on the customer's bill. These rules can be grouped in different configurations based on how you
want your bills to appear and the needs of your implementation. Recall that bill segment calculation headers are created for
Pre-Processing, Rate Version, and Post-Processing calculation groups. In addition, most rules can be configured generate a
bill line.

###### Identifying Calculation Rules that can be Shared/Reused

As you analyze the bill lines used by your rates, you should look for bill lines that utilize similar or identical variables or
calculations. These calculations are candidates for reuse. For example, if all of your residential rates offer a discount for
early payment, you would want to create a single rule to calculate that discount, and then use it each of the rates to which it
applies.

###### How to Reuse Calculation Rules

There are two approaches that can be used to reuse calculation rules.

- **Encapsulating Rules in a Calculation Group**
This approach involves grouping rules that can be applied to more than one rate into a single calculation group. You
would use this approach when you identify charges and other components in your rates that apply to multiple rates, but
that can be grouped together. Taxes for multiple types of jurisdictions (for example, State, County, and City) would be
suitable for this approach.

To use this approach, you simply create a calculation group that contains the rules to be applied to more than one rate.
For the tax example, you might create the following group and rules:

Calculation Group: Taxes, which includes:

Calculation Rule: State Tax (Apply To)

Calculation Rule: County Tax (Apply To)

Calculation Rule: City Tax (Apply To)

This "Taxes" calculation group can be included as a Rate Version Calculation Group in each of the rates to which the
taxes apply. This calculation group could also be referenced by an "Execute Calculation Group" rule, as outlined below.

- **Using "Execute Calculation Group" Rules**


-----

This approach involves creating a calculation group that contains one or more rules, which is then referenced by another
"Execute Calculation Group" rule. This approach can be used when you identify a charge or calculation that could be
applicable within one or more calculation groups. For example, if multiple rates involve calculating peak demand (or
some other quantity that is not measured by your customers' meters), you could create a "Calculate Demand" rule and
include it in a group that is then referenced by an "Execute Calculation Group" rule.

To use this approach, you create a calculation group that contains the calculation rules to be used within multiple
calculation groups. You then create an "Execute Calculation Group" rule that references the group. Last, you include this
"Execute Calculation Group" rule in the calculation groups to which it applies. For the calculate demand example, you
might create the following:

Calculation Rule: Calculate Demand (Execute Calculation Group), which references:

Calculation Group: Calculate Demand, which includes:

Calculation Rule: Calculate Demand (Calculate Service Quantity)

The "Calculate Demand" Execute Calculation Group rule can be included in any calculation group used to calculate
service quantities that includes calculating peak demand.

"Execute Calculation Group" rules can be used with any calculation group. To return the taxes example from above, if
you wanted to include your "Taxes" calculation group within other groups, you could use the following:

Calculation Rule: Taxes (Execute Calculation Group), which references:

Calculation Group: Taxes, which includes:

Calculation Rule: State Tax (Apply To)

Calculation Rule: County Tax (Apply To)

Calculation Rule: City Tax (Apply To)

See "Execute Calculation Group Rules - Nesting Calculation Rules" in About Calculation Rules for more information
about Execute Calculation Group rules.

###### Leveraging Eligibility Criteria to Dynamically Apply Calculation Rules

Another tool to consider when creating your calculation groups and rules is Eligibility Criteria. Eligibility criteria allow you
to define rules that determine the conditions under which a calculation rule is applied or not.

For example, if you need to calculate demand for one or more of your rates, you might create separate calculation rules to
calculate demand based on interval values of different units of measure (kWh vs kVarh for instance). You could create rules
for each and include them in a single "Calculate Demand" calculation group, but assign eligibility criteria to each such that
they are only executed when processing for the specified unit of measure.

See Eligibility Criteria in About Calculation Rules for more information about eligibility criteria and how they can be used
with calculation rules. In addition, refer to The Big Picture of Rate Component Eligibility Rules in the Rates chapter for
additional background on eligibility criteria.

###### Case Study: Three Sample Rates

Let's look at a sample set of rates, and how they might be implemented. We'll also look at which components of these rates
can be shared.

Now let's look at these same rates in terms of how we might implement them using calculation rules. The table below lists
the type of calculation rule used for each item on the rate.

**Rate** **Domestic Rate A** **Commercial Rate B** **Power Rate C**

Cost of Service Stepped Charges: Stepped Charges: Customer Charge:

                                                                        - Flat Charge calculation rule

Taxes State, County, and City Taxes:

                      - Apply To calculation rule (one

###### Shared Components


State, County, and City Taxes:

- Apply To calculation rule (one

for each type of tax)


State, County, and City Taxes:

- Apply To calculation rule (one

for each type of tax)


Now, let's look at the components of these rates that can be shared.

**Discounts: Rates A and B both use the same discount, so we could create a single "AB Discount" calculation rule that**
could be used with both rates. Note: Either this could be in its own calculation group that is listed among the Rate Version
Calculation Groups for each rate, or the group could be referenced by an "Execute Calculation Group" rule which in turn
would be included in one of the other Rate Version Calculation Groups used in each rate.

**Purchased Power and Fuel Adjustment: Rates A, B, and C all use the same adjustment for purchased power and fuel, so**
we could create a single "PPF Adjustment" calculation rule that could be used with all three rates. Again, this calculation
rule could be in its own calculation group listed on the rate, or in a group referenced by an "Execute Calculation Group" rule
included in another group.

**Taxes: Rates A, B, and C are all subject to the same taxes, so we could create calculation rules for each type of tax (State,**
County, and City) in a single group that could be used with all three rates. Again, these calculation rules could be in their


-----

own calculation group listed on the rate, or in a group referenced by an "Execute Calculation Group" rule included in
another group.

###### The Big Picture of Calculation Rule Eligibility Rules

You can use eligibility rules to define the criteria when a calculation rule should be applied (or skipped); for example,

- You may have a calculation rule that generates an employee discount. This calculation rule may have eligibility criteria
that requires the person to have a given characteristic type and value (this assumes you use a person characteristic to
identify employees) before the calculation rule is applied.

- You may have a calculation rule that applies a surcharge if the customer uses 25% more than they used in the same
period in prior year.

**NOTE:**
**Eligibility rules are optional. If you add eligibility rules to a calculation rule, the calculation rule will be skipped or**
applied per the instructions in the rules. If you don't add eligibility rules to a calculation rule, however, the calculation
rule will be executed – this is because calculation rules are eligible by default

The topics in this section describe eligibility rules.

###### A Rate Component is Eligible by Default

If you don't want to setup eligibility rules, you don't have to. If you don't specify eligibility rules on a calculation rule, it's
eligible and will be processed by rate application.

###### Defining Logical Eligibility Criteria

When you setup an eligibility criterion, you must define three things:

- The field to be compared

- The comparison method

- The comparison results

**Criteria Comparison**

You have the following choices in respect of identifying the Criteria Field Type:

- **Algorithm. You can execute an algorithm to retrieve a field value from someplace else in the system. This is a very**
powerful feature, but it's not terribly intuitive. We'll present an example later in this section to illustrate the power of this
approach.

- **Bill Factor. You can retrieve a bill factor value to use as a field value in the comparison.**

- **Calc Line. You can retrieve a calculation line amount to use as a field value. The value is derived by summing**
calculation lines defined as members of a target category.

- **Characteristic. You can retrieve a characteristic value linked to any of the following:**

  - The service agreement being billed

  - The service agreement's account

  - The main person linked to the service agreement's account


-----

  - The characteristic premise linked to the service agreement

  - One of the service points linked to the service agreement

  - In addition, you can retrieve a characteristic value from the Characteristic Collection where values are derived while
the rate is being calculated (characteristic values can be created by calculation rules)

- **Contract Quantity. You can retrieve a contract quantity for the service agreement.**

- **Service Quantity. You can retrieve the value of a given service quantity from the SQ collection based on a specified**
UOM / TOU / SQI.

- **Historical Quantity. You can derive a value based on the service agreement’s historical bill segment service quantities**
for the specified UOM / TOU / SQI.

You have the following choices in respect of identifying the Comparison Method:

- You can choose an operator (e.g., >, <, =, BETWEEN, IN, etc.) and a comparison value

**Comparison Results**

Once you have this information and have applied your comparison, you must define what action should be taken. You must
specify what to do if the results are True, False, or Insufficient Data.

- **If True or False. You have the option to apply the rule or not, or check the next condition.**

- **If Insufficient Data. You have the option apply the rule or not, check the next condition, or generate an error.**

See Examples of Calculation Rule Eligibility Rules for illustrations of these rules.

###### Examples of Calculation Rule Eligibility Rules

The topics in this section provide examples about how to setup calculation rule eligibility rules.

###### A Calculation Rule with a Service Quantity Comparison

Imagine a calculation rule that is only eligible if the customer is a low-income customer and has used more than 1,000 kWh.
This calculation rule would need the following eligibility rules:

- Customer is a low income customer

- The customer has used more than 1,000 kWh during the bill period

These rules will look as follows:

Seq Field to Compare Comparison Method If TRUE If FALSE If Insufficient Data


10 Main person

characteristic:

Characteristic type =

Low income indicator

20 SQ value:

UOM = KWH


= YES Check next condition Do Not Apply Rule Do Not Apply Rule

>= 1,000 Apply Rule Do Not Apply Rule Error


The criteria are similar - they retrieve a value and compare it to something:

The first criterion is fairly simple:


-----

- **Field to Compare. We indicate that the value of the Low Income Indicator characteristic is kept on the main person**
linked to the account should be retrieved. We assumed that this characteristic type has values of YES and NO.

- **Comparison Method and Results. We indicate that if the person has a characteristic value of YES, then we should**
check the next condition; otherwise, we indicate if the eligibility rule is false or there is insufficient data, the calculation
rule is skipped.

TThe second criterion works similarly:

- **Field to Compare. We indicate the service quantity (SQ) that holds the total amount of KWH that should be retrieved.**

- **Comparison Method and Results. We simply compare the value to 1,000. If the SQ is greater than or equal to 1000, the**
eligibility rule is True and the calculation rule is applied. If the SQ is less than 1000, the eligibility rule is false and the
calculation rule is skipped. If there is insufficient data, there is an error generated.

###### A Calculation Rule with a Characteristic Lookup and Consumption Comparison

Imagine a calculation rule that is eligible for customers who have signed up for a consumption reduction program and have
low consumption. This would require the following criteria:

- Check that the customer has signed up for the reduction program.

- Check to see that the customer’s consumption is lower than the threshold.

These rules will look as follows:

Seq Field to Compare Comparison Method If TRUE If FALSE If Insufficient Data


10 Check if the

customer has signed

up for the reduction

program

20 Check if

consumption is less

than the threshold


= Y Check next condition Do Not Apply Rule Do Not Apply Rule

< = 100 Kilowatt Apply Rule Do Not Apply Rule Do Not Apply Rule


The criteria are similar - they retrieve a value and compare it to something:

The first criterion works as follows:

- **Field to Compare. We indicate the value of the reduction program characteristic type (CI_CLMSM) is found on the**
service agreement. We assumed that this characteristic type has values of Y and N.

- **Comparison Method and Results. Comparison Method and Results. We indicate that if the service agreement has**
a characteristic value of Y, then we should check the next condition. If the condition is false or insufficient data, the
calculation rule is skipped.

The second criterion works as follows:

- **Field to Compare. We indicate the service quantity (SQ) that holds the total amount of KW that should be retrieved.**

- **Comparison Method and Results. We indicate that we want to compare the service quantity to the threshold (100**
kW). If the service agreement’s bill segment has a service quantity that is less than or equal to 100 kW, it is True and the
calculation rule is applied. If the condition is false or insufficient data, the calculation rule is skipped.

###### A Calculation Rule with a Discount for Being on Autopay

Imagine a calculation rule that is only eligible if the current customer has signed up for Autopay. This calculation rule
would need the following eligibility rule:


-----

- Customer has Autopay

This rule will look as follows:

Seq Field to Compare Comparison Method If TRUE If FALSE If Insufficient Data


10 Algorithm: check

if customer has

Autopay


= Y Apply Rule Do Not Apply Rule Do Not Apply Rule


The criterion calls an algorithm that performs a logical comparison.

The criterion works as follows:

- **Field to Compare. We chose a "field to compare" algorithm that checks if the account associated with the bill segment**
is on Autopay. If an autopay setup exists, then it returns a value of Y. If not, however, it returns N

- **Comparison Method and Results. We simply compare the value returned by the algorithm to Y and indicate the**
appropriate response. If the condition is true, the calculation rule is applied. If the condition is false or insufficient data,
the calculation rule is skipped.

**NOTE:**
Refer to CI_CHK_APAY for more information about this algorithm.

###### How to Use Description on Bill

Enter the verbiage to appear on the bill segment in the Description On Bill. Turn on Print if the verbiage should appear on
the printed bill.

**NOTE:**
**Suppressing calculation details on the printed bill. Only calculation rules that are used to calculate intermediate**
values are typically suppressed on a bill. For these types of calculation rules, we recommend using Description on Bill
to show users how the line was calculated, but select No from the Print dropdown menu. This way, users will see the
calculation details on the Bill Segment - Calc Lines window, but the customer won't see it on their bill.

Many lines that appear on a bill do not contain static verbiage. Rather, the printed lines contain information from the
calculation process. For example, the bill line for state tax would typically contain the tax percent.

You control exactly what is substituted in the bill line by entering one or more of the following substitution variables in the
**Description on Bill field:**

**NOTE:** If none of the following substitution characters satisfy your need, there is a plug-in option on the calculation rule
business object that allows customer modified variables. Algorithms can be attached to the business object as a Build
Line Description system event.

Substitution Character What It Does

%A Replaces the substitution character with the amount of the bill line.

Please be aware of the following:

                                                - If the calculation rule isn't designated as being "for calculation

purposes only" (FCPO), all trailing zeroes up to the decimal position

of the rate's currency will be removed. If the calculation rule is

designated as being "for calculation purposes only" (FCPO), the

number of decimal places as defined in the calculation rule's

precision will be shown.

                                                - All leading zeroes will be removed unless the value is between 1

and -1 in which case a leading 0 will appear before the decimal

place.

                                                - The Symbol on the Currency control table will prefix the value.

                                                - The position of the negative sign and currency symbol is dependent

on the display profile of the user who generate the bill (or who

submitted the batch billing process).

%B Replaces the substitution character with the begin/start date covered

by the bill calculation line.

If the charge is proratable, %B may be used in conjunction with %E to

display the period covered by the bill calculation line.

%C Replaces the substitution character with the number of items being

billed. Leading zeroes are suppressed.

%D Replaces the substitution character with message 10101 from

message category 11109. This message is maintained in the standard

message table.


-----

We recommend this message be set to "(prorated for %1 of %2 days)"

where %1 will be substituted with the number of days of prorated

consumption charged on the bill line and %2 will be the "normal" days

associated with the rate's prices. This message will only be substituted

when the calculation rule is prorated. Note, neither %1 nor %2 are

required.

Either this character OR %F should be used when you desire to

substitute the price / percent into the bill line.

If the charge is proratable, %D should be used in conjunction with %R

to print an appropriate message when the charges are prorated.

%E Replaces the substitution character with the end date covered by the

bill calculation line.

If the charge is proratable, %E may be used in conjunction with %B to

display the period covered by the bill calculation line.

%F Replaces the substitution character with message 10102 from

message category 11109. This message is maintained in the standard

message table.

We recommend this message be set to "(prorated by %1)" where %1

will be substituted with the factor used to prorate the charge. This

message will only be substituted when the calculation rule is prorated.

Note, %1 is not required.

If the charge is proratable, %F should be used in conjunction with %I to

print an appropriate message when the charges are prorated.

%H Replaces the substitution character with the high value defined on the

calculation rule used to calculate the specific stepped charge on the bill

line.

%I Replaces the substitution character with the value specified in the

calculation rule / bill factor.

If the value is a percent,

                                                - all leading and trailing zeroes will be suppressed,

                                                - and a "%" will be suffixed to the resultant value.

If the value is not a percent,

                                                - all trailing zeroes up to the decimal position of the rate's currency

will be removed,

                                                - and all leading zeroes will be removed unless the value is between

1 and -1 in which case a leading 0 will appear before the decimal

place,

                                                - and note that the position of the negative sign and currency symbol

is dependent on the display profile of the user who generate the bill

(or who submitted the batch billing process).

Either this character OR %R should be used when you desire to

substitute the price / percent into the bill line. Using %I will cause the

value as specified in the calculation rule to be substituted regardless of

whether the charges are prorated.

If the charge is proratable, %I should be used in conjunction with %F to

print an appropriate message when the charges are prorated.


-----

%L Replaces the substitution character with the low value defined on the

calculation rule used to calculate the specific stepped charge on the bill

line.

%M Replaces the substitution character with the item type defined on the

calculation rule used to calculate the specific item type charge on the

bill line.

This is only applicable to calculation rule-based rates.

%O Replaces the substitution character with the description of the time-of
use (TOU) code being billed on this line

%Q Replaces the substitution character with the service quantity being

billed. Leading zeroes are suppressed. The decimal places shown are

specified in a field on the Unit Of Measure control table.

If you wish to suppress trailing zeroes after the decimal, you must set

up the Allow Consumption Zero Suppression In Bill Description option

type on the Financial Transaction Options Feature Configuration.

%R Replaces the substitution character with the value specified in the

calculation rule / bill factor. Either this character OR %I should be used

when you desire to substitute the price / percent into the bill line. Using

%R causes the prorated price / percent to be printed in the bill line (%I

causes the price / percent as specified in the rate to be printed during

proration situations).

If the charge is proratable, %R should be used in conjunction with %D

to print an appropriate message when the charges are prorated.

%S Replaces the substitution character with the summed amount. All

trailing zeroes up to the decimal position of the rate's currency will

be removed. All leading zeroes will be removed unless the value is

between 1 and -1 in which case a leading 0 will appear before the

decimal place. The Symbol on the Currency control table will prefix the

value. If the value is negative, a "-" will prefix the value.

This character should only be used with Minimum, Apply To, and

Summary calculation rules.

%T Replaces the substitution character with message 10103 from

message category 11109. This message is maintained in the standard

message table.

We recommend this message be set to "(%1% exempt)" where %1

will be substituted with the tax exemption percent as specified in the

service agreement. This message will only be substituted when the

calculation rule's bill factor is eligible for tax exemptions AND the

customer is exempt from the tax. Note, %1 is not required.

%V Replaces the substitution character with the "C1-ADDSC" characteristic

ad hoc value retrieved by the calculation rule used to calculate the

charge on the bill line.

Lines that don't print If the bill line is not printed (as defined by the Print option), message

10104 from message category 4 will be appended to the bill line. This

message is maintained in the standard message table.

We recommend this message be "NOT SEEN BY CUSTOMER!" This

message appears in the bill line that appears in the billing windows but

does not appear on the customer's bill.


-----

The following are examples of the content of common Description on Bills along with how the line would look on the
customer's bill:

Description on Bill On Calculation Rule How It Looks On A Bill

%C lamp pole(s) at %I per pole %F 1,234 lamp pole(s) at $5.00 per pole (prorated by .3333)

- **Detailed Description: A detailed description of the rule.**

In addition, several of the base package calculation rules also use the following parameters:

- **Description On Bill: The text that appears on the bill line generated for this calculation rule. Variables can be used**
to dynamically generate text (such as, price and quantity) when billing calculates the charges. Refer to How To Use
Description on Bill for more information about available substitution variables.

- **Print (Yes or No): A flag that specifies if the bill line created by this calculation rule should appear on the customer's**
bill. All bill lines are shown on Bill Segment - Calculation Details. However, only those lines marked as Print are
presented to the customer.

- **Print If Zero (Yes or No): A flag that specifies if a bill line should be printed if the bill line's value is zero.**

- **Rounding Type: This flag specifies if the calculated value should be rounded Down, Up, or Nearest. Used with**
Precision to control how the system rounds the rule's calculated value.

- **Precision: This field defaults to a value consistent with the decimal positions defined on the rate schedule's currency**
code. Used with Rounding Type to control how the system rounds the rule's calculated value.

- **FCPO (For Calculation Purposes Only): A flag that indicates if this calculation rule exists purely to calculate a value**
used by another calculation rule. When set to Yes, the system does not include the calculated amount in the bill total. The
following are required when FCPO is set to Yes:

  - **Create Bill Line: Determines if a bill line should be created for the rule (if there is no need to show the results to the**
customer or a user, there is no need to create a bill line).

  - **FCPO Retention Rule: If a bill line created, this defines if the FCPO amount should be set to zero on the bill line or**
whether the bill line's amount should be set equal to the FCPO amount.

- **Override Proration: A flag that specifies if an override proration algorithm should be used. This is used in situations**
when the standard proration logic does not satisfy your requirements. In this case, you may plug in an override proration
algorithm to calculate the proration factors required by your implementation. This algorithm can be specified on the
calculation rule business object or on the parent calculation rule business object if the override proration applies to all
rates.

- **Seasonal (Yes or No): A flag that specifies if charges associated with the calculation rule are only levied during a**
specific season. If set to "Yes", the following must be specified:

  - **Season Start: Defines the start of the season for the calculation rule.**

  - **Season End: Defines the end of the season for the calculation rule.**

  - **Seasonal Prorate Method: Defines how the system should prorate a seasonal charge when a bill segment's period is**
not entirely within the seasonal period. The following options are available:

    - **Accounting Date, Consumption End Date and Consumption Start Date options will not prorate the charge**
calculated by the calculation rule. Rather, it will only calculate the charge if the accounting date associated with the


-----

bill segment is within the seasonal period, or if the consumption period's end date is within the seasonal period, or
if the consumption period's start date is within the seasonal period respectively.

    - **Prorate will prorate the calculation rule charge based on number of days in the season that is included in the bill**
period.

    - The Prorate Seasonal SQ option is only pertinent if you have:

     - Seasonal service quantity (SQ) charges, AND

     - Meters that measure seasonal consumption on separate registers, AND

     - You have a bill that crosses seasonal boundaries, AND

     - You have multiple rate version calculation groups effective across the bill period.
If the Prorate Seasonal SQ option is used, the system will prorate the charge calculated by a SQ calculation rule
based on the number of days in the season that is included in the rate version calculation group's period.

- **GL Distribution: If the charge calculated by the calculation rule impacts the general ledger, you must define the**
distribution code used to construct the GL account.

  - **Distribution Code Source: Specifies the type of GL distribution to use for this calculation rule.**
If the calculation rule's charges should be booked to a single GL account regardless of the service agreement's SA
Type's revenue class, select the Specific Distribution Code source and enter a Distribution Code.

If the calculation rule's charges are booked to a different GL account depending on the service agreement's revenue
class, select the Revenue Class source and insert the appropriate Revenue Class and Distribution Code for each that
uses the rate.

- **Cross Reference: Defines the calculation line categories that the resultant calculation details belong to. For example, for**
a rate that calculates city and state taxes on consumption and demand based charges, the following categories could be
used to calculate these taxes:

  - A calculation line category type called "Taxable" with a category value for City Tax and another for State Tax.

  - Each of the rate's calculation rules used for consumption and demand based charges should define the Member
Category(s) that it belongs to ("Taxable - City Tax" and "Taxable - State Tax"). In other words, these rules would be
defined as a member of the city tax and state tax categories.

  - The Apply To rules used to calculate city tax and state tax should define the respective Target Category(s) ("Taxable City Tax" and "Taxable - State Tax") that they are applied to.
There are two types of cross-reference categories:

  - **Target Category: Specifies the category that the calculation rule targets. Used with Apply To, Maximum Charge,**
and Minimum Charge calculation rules.

  - **Member Category: Specifies the category to which the calculation rule belongs.**

- **Characteristics: Defines additional calculation rule attributes that may be used in rate processing or for reporting**
purposes. A calculation rule's characteristics are copied onto the resultant bill lines for those characteristic types that are
allowed on bill segment calc lines. You can indicate that “C1-ADDSC” characteristic ad hoc value of a bill line should
be substituted into the bill line's description by using the %V substitution variable in the calculation rule's Description
**On Bill field.**

###### Calculation Rule Validation

All calculation rules are validated when created to ensure they contain proper data needed to perform their calculations. The
algorithms used to perform these validations are performed by the algorithms specified in the “Validation” system event on
the calculation rule’s business object.


-----

###### Calculation Rules

This section provides descriptions for the base package calculation rules.

###### Apply To

Apply To calculation rules create bill lines that levy charges based on amounts calculated on other bill lines. Apply To
calculation rules must define the respective target category that they are applied to. The calculation rule(s) that compute
charges to which "Apply To" rules will be applied must be defined as members of the target category. See Cross-Reference
under Common Parameters for more information about Member and Target categories.

- **Rule Name: Apply To**

- **Base Package Calculation Rule Business Object: C1-ApplyTo**

- **Apply Calculation Rule Algorithm Type / Algorithm: C1-APPLYTO**

- **Rule Parameters:**

  - **Calculation Details: Details regarding how the calculation rule performs its calculations:**

of the target category at billing time.

    - **Seasonal: See Common Parameters.**

    - **Value Type: Defines if the price is a Charge, Percentage or Unit Rate.**

    - **Value Source: specifies the source of the price. Depending on the value source selected, either a Bill Factor,**
Value, or Value Algorithm is required.

- **Example: The following calculation rule applies a county tax other calculation rules that belong the "Taxable - County**
Tax" category.
**Calculation Group: Taxes**

**Calculation Rule: CNTYTAX**

**Sequence: 530**

**Description: County Tax**

**Description On Bill: County sales tax %R %T**

**Print: Yes**

**Print if Zero: No**

**Rounding Type: Nearest**

**Precision: 0.01**

**FCPO: No**

**Override Proration: No**

###### Calculate Final Reading Values

Calculate Final Reading Values calculation rules determine the final values for readings based on user-defined UOM/TOU/
SQI.

- **Rule Name: Calculate Final Reading Values**

- **Base Package Calculation Rule Business Object: C1-CalculateFinalValue**

- **Apply Calculation Rule Algorithm Type / Algorithm: C1-CALCFNVL**

- **Rule Parameters:**

  - **Calculation Details: Details regarding how the calculation rule performs its calculations:**

    - **Unit of Measure: The unit of measure for the measured quantity.**

    - **Time of Use: The time of use for the measured quantity.**

    - **Service Quantity Identifier: The service quantity identifier for the measured quantity.**

    - **Retain Measured SQ: indicates whether to save the accumulated measured quantity entry in the SQ collection. If**
this value is set to No, it means the value will be removed from the SQ collection. Before any pre-processing rule
is executed, the rate engine will place the sum / max value of the read details into the SQ collection. For example,
if the read details contain entries for measured CCF, there will be an entry in the SQ collection for the total CCF
from all read details. This might be what is needed, but it may be extraneous if a rule converts the measured
quantity into therms. In this situation, the SQ collection only needs therms and the CCF entry can be removed.

    - **Formula: Defines the formula used to calculate the final read quantity. Bill Factors (or scalar variables) to be**
used in the calculation are designated as Vn, where n matches the number assigned to the variable (i.e. V1 =
Bill Factor 1, V2 = Bill Factor 2, etc.). Measured Quantity is referenced as MQ in the formula Mathematical
operations supported include addition, subtraction, multiplication and division. For example: (MQ * V1) would be
the formula to convert CCF to THERM.

  - **Scalar Variables: Defines the scalar variables or Bill Factors to be used in the calculation. When referenced in the**
formula, scalar variables are designated as Vn, where n matches the number assigned to the variable (i.e. V1 = Bill
Factor 1, V2 = Bill Factor 2, etc.). Note that only regular bill factors may be used in the formula. Interval and Time of
Use bill factors are not supported.

    - **Sequence: Designates the number of the variable (V1, V2, etc.)**

    - **Bill Factor: The Bill Factor used for the variable.**

  - **Result: Defines the type of data (Unit of Measure, Time of Use, and/or Service Quantity Identifier) to be used for**
the final quantity calculated by the rule.

- **Processing: The following processing takes place:**

  - The rule will process each read detail whose initial UOM matches the measured quantity UOM.

  - It substitutes the reference to MQ in the formula with each read's measured quantity and then calls the formula service
passing the defined bill factors as variables 1 to n. The read's end date is passed as the effective date.

  - It then populates each read's final value with the results of the formula and it populates the final UOM / TOU / SQI
with the values defined on the rule.


-----

  - It populates the SQ collection with the results (this will either add a new value if the Final UOM / TOU / SQI is not
present in the SQ collection, OR it will update the existing SQ quantity with the sum or max of the calculated value
depending on the Final UOM's measure's peak value). Note, the initial and final values of such an SQ will be the
calculated value.

  - It then removes the measured UOM / TOU / SQI from the SQ collection if the rule has been configured as such.

- **Example: This calculation rule converts CCF (as recorded on the meter) to therms for billing purposes.**
**Calculation Group: CCF to Therm Conversion (Calculate SQ - SQ and BF)**

**Calculation Rule: CCF2TH**

**Sequence: 10**

**Description: Convert CCF to TH**

**Calculation Details:**

  - **Unit of Measure: 100 cubic feet of gas**

  - **Retain Measured SQ: Yes**

  - **Formula: MQ*V1*V2**

  - 1 / Pressure adjustment zone

  - 2 /Take point for therm conv.fac
**Result:**

  - **Unit of Measure: Thermal units**

    - **Result Source: Defines the method to use to calculate for the service quantity. Can be one of the following:**

     - **Set Function Against Derived Vector: Applies a function to the derived interval values. The function to be**
applied is specified in the Set Function field.

     - **Scalar Formula Result: Applies a user-defined formula. The formula is specified in the Scalar Formula field.**

    - **Set Function: the function to apply to the derived interval values (applicable only if Result Source is set to Set**
Function Against Derived Vector). Can be one of the following:

     - **Average: Calculates the average of the derived interval measurement values.**

     - **Count: Returns the number of derived interval measurements.**

     - **Max: Returns the maximum value from the derived interval measurement values.**

data to calculate billing quantities. Examples include the following:

  - Derive an interval data curve (vector) given a formula. For example, derive a power factor curve given a formula
using kWh and kVarh curves.

  - Apply TOU mapping to a derived interval data curve. For example, after deriving the power factor curve, perform
TOU mapping on the result.

  - Perform mathematical operations on SQ entries. For example, get total kWh consumption by adding "kWh On Peak",
"kWh Off Peak", and "kWh Shoulder Peak" where "kWh On Peak", "kWh Off Peak", and "kWh Shoulder Peak" were
calculated by a previous calculation rule.
Each interval data curve is defined as a vector parameter (the rule can define up to 5 vectors). Mathematical
operations defined by the "Vector Processing" parameters can be performed between vectors (e.g. IV1 * IV2) and
between vectors and scalar variables (e.g. IV1 * V1).

###### Maximum Charge

Maximum Charge calculation rules are used to create bill lines that levy charges only when the sum of previously calculated
lines is more than the maximum charge amount. Maximum charge calculation rules must define the respective target
category that they are applied to. The calculation rule(s) that compute charges that the maximum is levied on must be
defined as members of the target category. See Cross-Reference under Common Parameters for more information about
Member and Target categories.

Note that if the values being compared are negative values, the comparison is NOT done on the absolute values, but
rather on the actual values. For example, imagine you have a maximum discount of $ -2.00 and previous calculation rules
have calculated a discount of $ -3.00. You want a calculation rule to create a bill line for $1.00 to reduce the discount. A
maximum charge calculation rule will not work in this case because -3 is considered less than -2. For this business scenario
you should use a Minimum Charge calculation rule.

**Note: Maximum Charge calculation rules are rare. You tend to only see them in deregulated markets where customers have**
agreed to pay the market rate but want a cap on the maximum they'll pay each bill period.

###### Minimum Charge

Minimum Charge calculation rules create bill lines that levy charges only when the sum of previously calculated lines is
less than the minimum charge amount. Minimum charge calculation rules must define the respective target category that
they are applied to. The calculation rule(s) that compute charges that the minimum is levied on must be defined as members
of the target category. See Cross-Reference under Common Parameters for more information about Member and Target
categories.


-----

Note that if the values being compared are negative values, the comparison is NOT done on the absolute values, but rather
on the actual values. For example, imagine you have a minimum discount of $ -2.00 and previous calculation rules have
calculated a discount of $ -1.00. You want a calculation rule to create a bill line for $ -1.00 to apply a further discount. A
minimum charge calculation rule will not work in this case because -1 is considered more than -2. For this business scenario
you should use a maximum charge calculation rule.

###### Service Quantity

Service Quantity calculation rules create bill lines that levy charges based on some type of consumption.

Frequently the amount consumed is measured by a meter's registers and sometimes it's calculated using Pre-Processing
calculation and sometimes it's derived based on the type of item (such as, lamps). Regardless of how the amount consumed
is calculated, the charge for the consumption amount is levied using this type of calculation rule.

###### Rate Check

This section describes the features and functionality of Rate Check.

###### About Rate Check

The Rate Check feature allows you to test your rate schedules under different scenarios. For example, you can test your
rates for an existing account using previous bill segments, or by providing user-specified bill period and service quantities.

###### Performing a Rate Check

**NOTE:** The Rate Check portal works with both calculation rule-based and component-based rate schedules.

Use this procedure to perform a rate check.

- Select Menu > Rates > Rate Check.

- Select the Rate Schedule for the rate check.

- Select the Service Agreement for the rate check.

- Select the Bill Segment for the rate check (if you wish to base the rate check on an existing bill segment).

- Enter the Start Date, End Date, and Accounting Date for the rate check.

- Select the Revenue Class for the rate check.

- If you are basing the rate check on user-specified Service Quantities, enter the following for each as applicable:

- **UOM: The unit of measure applicable for the rate check (based on the specified rate schedule)**

- **TOU: The time of use applicable for the rate check (based on the specified rate schedule)**

- **SQI: The service quantity identifier applicable for the rate check (based on the specified rate schedule)**

- **Measured Quantity: The amount of the service quantity specified.**

- **Service Point ID: The service point which recorded the service quantities, if applicable**
Note: If you specified a Service Agreement and Bill Segment, this section is populated based on the selected data, but
can be manually overwritten.

- Specify characteristic types and values for any Characteristics are applicable to the rate check. Characteristic types and
values are used to apply appropriate bill factor values during rate processing.

- If you are using a calculation rule-based rate schedule, specify if the system Should Trace the process. This produces
logs that outline the calculation groups and rules used by the rate schedule.

- Execute the rate check:

  - If you wish to execute the rate check using a specified bill segment or service quantities, click Check Rate.

  - If you wish to execute the rate check using billing determinants retrieved from an external system (such as Oracle
Utilities Meter Data Management), select the appropriate function from the Select Function dropdown list.


-----

###### Viewing the Results of a Rate Check

The outcome of the rate check process is displayed on the Results tab. This tab contains the following zones:

- **Main: Displays results of the rate check, including:**

  - **Rate Schedule: The rate schedule used in the rate check**

  - **Revenue Class: The revenue class used for the rate check.**

  - **Bill Period: The start and end dates for the bill period used by the rate check.**

  - **Consumption Period: The start and dates for the consumption period used by the rate check.**

  - **Accounting Date: The Accounting Date used by the rate check.**

  - **Calculated Amount: The calculated total for the rate check**

- **Calculation Lines: Displays the bill calculation headers and lines for the rate schedule.**

- **Read Details: Displays meter read details for the consumption used in the rate calculation.**

- **Characteristics: Displays characteristics referenced by the rate calculation (if applicable).**

- **Trace Log: Displays logs that outline the calculation groups and rules used by the rate schedule. This zone is populated**
only if using a calculation rule-based rate schedule, and if the Should Trace dropdown list is set to "No".

###### Effective Dates and Price Proration

This section describes how proration applies to different types of calculation rules. Proration implies assessing charges
proportionately.

The term "proration" describes two different issues:

- Prorating a charge whose value changes during a bill period. For example, if a tax rate changes during a bill period and
you've indicated that such changes should be prorated, the system prorates the tax change (e.g., 20 days at 5% and 10
days at 6%).

- Prorating charges when the time period being billed is not in sync with the time period in which the charges were defined
in the rate. For example, if a rate contains a flat monthly charge and the bill period spans two months, the flat charge
must be prorated.

This is a complicated topic as it's possible for many proration issues to exist on a single bill. For example, on a single bill:

- The rate structure can change several times during the bill period (i.e., multiple rate versions are effective).

- The taxing authority changes the tax rate.

- The customer's tax exemption changes.

- The customer-specific price can change.

- etc.

###### Types of Proration

The following section describes the types of proration performed by applying a rate.

**FASTPATH:**


-----

For more information on how prorated charges are presented on the printed bill, refer to How To Use Description On
Bill.

###### Consumption Period Proration

A rate schedule specifies its frequency. Bill segments generated using a rate are expected to have a consumption period that
corresponds to this frequency. When a bill segment's consumption period falls outside of the rate frequency's normal period,
proratable service quantities may be adjusted to match the normal period for calculation. The service quantities are then readjusted based on calculation period proration.

**FASTPATH:**
Refer to Service Quantity Proration for more information about these calculations.

###### Calculation Period Proration

There can be multiple versions of a given rate over time. Each version has an effective date. When the system detects that a
rate schedule has multiple versions of a rate in effect during a bill period, it may or may not prorate the charges. You control
exactly how the system handles this situation using the rate schedule's proration parameters.

If multiple rate versions are effective during the consumption period and the rate schedule is configured to prorate the rate
versions, a given bill segment will contain a set of bill calculation lines for each rate version. You should consider quite
carefully how to handle this situation on your printed bills as rate version proration can confuse a customer.

**FASTPATH:**
Refer to Defining Calculation Rules for more information.

###### Bill Factor Proration

A rate contains calculation rules. The primary reason a calculation rule exists is to define how much to charge for the
services sold by your company. When you create calculation rules, you have two ways to indicate how much to charge:

- You can specify the value directly in a calculation rule.

- You can have the calculation rule use a bill factor that contains the value.

Bill factors are effective-dated (meaning, their values may change over time). When the system detects that a calculation
rule's bill factor has multiple values in effect during a bill period, it may or may not prorate the charges. You control exactly
how the system handles this situation using the bill factor's proration parameters.

**FASTPATH:**
Refer to Defining Bill Factors and Bill Factor Value Proration for more information.

###### Tax Exemption Proration

Bill factors that levy taxes may or may not be eligible for tax exemptions; it's up to the respective taxing authority.
Customers who are eligible for tax exemptions will have their tax obligation reduced (or nullified) at billing time.


-----

Whether or not a customer is tax exempt (and the percent exempt) is defined on the service agreement's tax exemption
page. A customer's tax exemptability is effective-dated (it may change over time). If a customer's tax exemptability changes
during a bill period, the system may or may not prorate the charges. You control exactly how the system handles this
situation using the bill factor's proration parameters.

###### Contract Value Proration

Some types of bill factors do not have the same value for all customers. For example, you may have rates where the price
per kilowatt-hour can be different for every customer using the rate.

For bill factors whose value is customer-specific, the value is defined on the service agreement's contract value page. The
contract value is effective-dated (it may change over time). If a customer's contract value changes during a bill period, the
system may or may not prorate the changes. You control exactly how the system handles this situation using the bill factor's
proration parameters.

###### Contract Rider Proration

Contract riders are used when the charge associated with a bill factor is only applicable to some customers for some period
of time. For example, if a bill factor is used to provide a discount during the first three months of service, then a contract
rider would be used.

A customer's contract rider applicability period is defined on the service agreement's contract rider page. A rider's
applicability may change during a customer's bill period. You control exactly what the system does when a rider's
applicability changes during a bill period using the bill factor's proration parameters.

###### A Service Agreement’s Rate Changes Are Not Prorated

A service agreement's rate is effective-dated (it may change over time). When the system calculates a service agreement's
bill segment when multiple rates are effective during the bill period, it will use a single rate from the service agreement's
rate history. The system chooses the rate as per the service agreement's SA type's rate selection date.

**FASTPATH:**
Refer to SA Type - Rate for more information.

###### Proration Factors

The purpose of calculation rules is to generate bill calculation lines. When rate application builds bill calculation lines, it
may also prorate the charges.

There are multiple types of proration performed by rate application. Service quantities, step boundaries, rate values, and bill
factor values may all be prorated as part of applying a rate.

We need to establish some terms in order to understand the calculations.

###### Normal Days


-----

As mentioned previously, the rate schedule references a frequency that specifies the number of times per year that service
agreements referencing the rate are expected to bill. The following formula dictates a rate frequency's normal days: 365
days / number of periods per year.

Example:

- For a monthly frequency (12 periods per year), 365 / 12 = 30 days.

- For a quarterly frequency (4 periods per year), 365 / 4 = 91 days.

**FASTPATH:**
Refer to Defining Frequency Codes for more information.

###### Consumption Period Factor

Before applying a rate, the bill segment's consumption period is determined. The ratio of normal days to consumption
period days is the consumption period factor.

The system uses the Minimum and Maximum Days Offset on the rate's Frequency to determine whether or not the
calculation rule should be prorated due to a short or long consumption period.

If the number of days in the consumption period is within the tolerance of days determined by the specified on the rate's
frequency, the consumption period factor is 1 (not applicable).

Example:

If the consumption period spans 60 days and the rate's normal days equals 30 days then the consumption period factor is:

- 30 days / 60 days = 0.5

If the consumption period spans 31 days and the rate's normal days equals 30 days and the maximum offset is 3 days, the
consumption period factor is 1 (not applicable) because the consumption period days falls within the tolerance specified on
the frequency.

**FASTPATH:**
For more information on how a bill segment's consumption period is determined, refer to How the System Requests
How Much Was Consumed. For more information on specifying minimum and maximum offset days on frequency,
refer to Defining Frequency Codes.

###### Calculation Period Factor

The calculation period is the date range where a rate version is effective during the consumption period. For each rate
version that is effective during the consumption period, a bill segment calculation period is created. A set of bill calculation
lines is created for each calculation period.

A calculation period factor is determined for each calculation period. The calculation period factor is the ratio of calculation
period days to normal days. If the consumption period factor is 1 (not applicable), then the calculation period factor is the
ratio of calculation period days to consumption period days.

Example:

If the consumption period covers April 1 to April 30 and there was a new effective rate version as of April 21, there are two
calculation periods.

- Calculation period April 1 to April 20, calculation period factor = 20 days / 30 days = 0.6666667.

- Calculation period April 21 to April 30, calculation period factor = 10 days / 30 days = 0.3333333.


-----

###### BF Value Period Factor

The bill factor value period is the date range where a proratable bill factor value is effective during the calculation period.

When a bill factor value changes during the calculation period, the results is that multiple bill calculation lines are generated
for the same calculation rule.

The ratio of the number of days within the calculation period that a distinct value is effective to the number of days in the
calculation period determines the BF value period factor. When the bill factor is set up not to prorate, the BF value period
factor is 1 (not applicable).

Example:

If the state tax rate changes from 6% to 6.5% on April 16 and the calculation period is April 1 to April 30, there are two bill
factor value periods.

- Bill factor value period April 1 to April 15, BF value period factor = 15 days / 30 days = 0.5.

- Bill factor value period April 16 to April 30, BF value period factor = 15 days / 30 days = 0.5.

**FASTPATH:**
Refer to Defining Bill Factors for more information on specifying whether the bill factor allows proration.

###### Overriding Proration Factors

If the system logic for determining proration factors does not satisfy your requirements, you may plug in an override
proration algorithm to calculate the proration factors as required by your implementation.

- For Calculation Rule-Based Rates, the override proration algorithm is specified in the calculation rule’s business object.

- For Component-Based Rates, the overriding proration algorithm is specified in the Installation record.

The system is delivered with an algorithm type that sets the proration factors to 1 (not applicable) when a predefined
characteristic is specified on a calculation rule. Refer to OVPF-NOPROR for more information.

###### Service Quantity Proration

When a bill calculation line is generated for a service quantity type calculation rule, the applicable service quantity is
multiplied by the consumption period factor. That product is then multiplied by the calculation period factor to determine
the prorated service quantity for the bill calculation line.

Example:

Customer's electricity bill segment's consumption period is from April 1 through May 15. A new rate version for the rate
schedule is effective as of April 16. 100 kWh is consumed.

Assuming a monthly frequency, if the consumption period spans 45 days and the first calculation period spans 15 days, and
the applicable service quantity is 100 kWh; then:

- Consumption period factor = 30 normal days / 45 days = 0.6666667.

- Calculation period factor = 15 days / 30 normal days = 0.5.

- Prorated service quantity = 100 kWh x 0.6666667 x 0.5 = 33 kWh.

The next calculation period extends to the end of the consumption period (30 days):


-----

- Consumption period factor does not change = 0.6666667.

- Calculation period factor = 30 days / 30 days = 1.0.

- Prorated service quantity = 100 kWh x 0.6666667 x 1.0 = 67 kWh.

###### Measures Peak

If the calculation rule specifies that the service quantity measures peak, then service quantity proration is not performed.
Although service quantities are not prorated if a calculation rule measures peak, calculation rule values (like price per kW)
are prorated.

**FASTPATH:**
Refer to Calculation Rule Value Proration for more information.

###### Step Proration

If a calculation rule's charges are based on stepped pricing then the step boundaries are also prorated (as long as the
calculation rule is not marked as measures peak). Step boundaries are multiplied by the calculation period factor to
determine the adjusted steps boundaries.

Example:

Assuming a monthly frequency, if the calculation rule's step boundaries are 100 kWh to 300 kWh, and the calculation
period is 45 days; the step boundaries are prorated as:

- 45 days / 30 days x 100 kWh = 150 kWh.

- 45 days / 30 days x 300 kWh = 450 kWh.

###### Step Multipliers

If the calculation rule specifies that the steps be multiplied by the result value of another calculation rule, step proration
is not performed. It is assumed that the result value from the referenced calculation rule has already been prorated, as the
referenced step calculation rule is subject to Calculation Rule Value Proration.

###### Calculation Rule Value Proration

Except for summary type calculation rules (which are not prorated at all), a value is specified on the calculation rule. The
value may be a unit rate, percentage or charge. The value may be specified directly on the calculation rule, derived from a
bill factor, derived from another calculation rule, or calculated by an algorithm.

Regardless of where the calculation rule value comes from, it will be multiplied by the calculation period factor when
determining the charge on a bill calculation line. Exceptions to this rule are:

- Unit rate values where the calculation rule's measures peak attribute is not checked.

- Percentage values.

- Calculation rule values derived from another calculation rule.

Even though the calculation rule values are not prorated for unit rate and percentage value types, if these rate values change
during the calculation period due to a bill factor value change, bill factor value proration still applies.


-----

Values derived from another calculation rule are not subject to rate value proration, as calculation rule value proration was
already performed on the referenced calculation rule. Again, if the bill factor value changed on the referenced calculation
rule, bill factor value proration still applies.

Example:

A calculation rule charges $2.00 per kW. The rate schedule's normal days equals 30, and the calculation period spans 15
days. The peak kW service quantity is 50 kW.

- The calculation period factor is 0.5 (15 days / 30 days).

- Calculation rule value proration yields $2.00 x 0.5 = $1.00 per kW.

**FASTPATH:**
For more information on bill factor value proration, refer to Bill Factor Value Proration.

###### Bill Factor Value Proration

Bill factor value proration behaves the same way any time a bill factor value changes within a calculation period. This could
be due to a change in a tax rate, a contract rider becoming effective, a tax exemption expiring, etc.

Multiple bill calculation lines are generated for a given calculation rule when a proratable bill factor value changes during
the calculation period.

Example:

If the state tax rate changes from 6% to 6.5% on April 16, and the calculation period is April 1 to April 30.

- The first BF value factor period April 1 to April 15, so BF value period factor is 0.5.

- The value used in the first bill calculation line for state tax is 6% x 0.5 = 3%.

- The second bill factor value period is April 16 to April 30, so the BF value period factor is 0.5.

- The value used in the second bill calculation line for state tax is 6.5% x 0.5 = 3.25%.

###### Example of Generating Prorated Bill Calculation Lines

Let's say that 1200 kWh was consumed from March 17 to April 30. The peak kW for the consumption period is 20 kW.

A monthly rate schedule E-COM1 exists with two rate versions.

Rate version effective prior to April 1 has the following components:

- $0.05 per kWh.

- $1.00 per kW.

Rate version effective as of April 1 has the following calculation rules:

- $0.04 per kWh; as of April 16, $0.07 per kWh (new effective bill factor value).

- $1.50 per kW; as of April 16, $1.25 per kW (new effective bill factor value).

**Calculation Period March 17 to March 31**

The consumption period spans 45 days, so the consumption period factor is 30 normal days / 45 days = 0.6666667.

This calculation period spans 15 days, so the calculation period factor is 0.5.

Service quantity proration for the first calculation period yields:

- 1200 kWh x 0.6666667 (consumption period factor) x 0.5 (calculation period factor) = 400 kWh.


-----

- 20 kW x 1 (not applicable) = 20 kW.

Calculation rule value proration for the first calculation period yields:

- $0.05 x 1 (not applicable) = $.05 per kWh.

- $1.00 x 0.5 (calculation period factor) = $0.50 per kW.

**First Set of Bill Calculation Lines**

Bill calculation line 1: 400 kWh x $0.05 = $20.00.

Bill calculation line 2: 20 kW x $0.50 = $10.00.

**Calculation Period April 1 to April 30**

This calculation period spans 30 days, so the calculation period factor is 1.

Service quantity proration for the calculation period yields:

- 1200 kWh x 0.6666667 (consumption period factor) x 1 (calculation period factor) = 800 kWh.

- 20 kW x 1 (not applicable) = 20 kW.

Calculation rule value proration for the first calculation period yields:

- $0.04 x 1 (not applicable) x 0.5 (BF value period factor) = $0.02 per kWh.

- $0.07 x 1 (not applicable) x 0.5 (BF value period factor) = $0.035 per kWh.

- $1.50 x 1 (calculation period factor) x 0.5 (BF value period factor) = $0.75 per kW.

- $1.25 x 1 (calculation period factor) x 0.5 (BF value period factor) = $0.625 per kW.

**Second Set of Bill Calculation Lines**

Bill calculation line 1: 800 kWh x $0.02 per kWh = $16.00.

Bill calculation line 2: 800 kWh x $0.035 per kWh = $26.00.

Bill calculation line 3: 20 kW x $0.75 per kW = $15.00.

Bill calculation line 4: 20 kW x $0.625 per kW = $12.50.

###### Seasonal Proration

Seasonal proration adds another layer of complexity. If calculation rules are specified to prorate seasonally, the seasonal
period specified on a given seasonal calculation rule dictates how a calculation rule's value or associated service quantity is
prorated.

There are two proration methods, Prorate and Prorate Seasonal SQ, which may be specified on seasonal calculation rules.
Both of these proration methods behave the same way with respect to calculation rule value proration. If a given seasonal
calculation rule is eligible for Calculation Rule Value Proration, the ratio of days in the season that are applicable during
the calculation period to the days in the calculation period determines the seasonal factor. When it comes to service quantity
proration, the two proration methods are different. If a given seasonal calculation rule is eligible for Service Quantity
Proration, it prorates the service quantities as follows:

- Prorate. A seasonal factor is calculated as the ratio of days in the season that are applicable during the calculation period
to the days in the calculation period. This ratio is applied along with the consumption period factor and calculation period
factor to determine the prorated service quantity.

- Prorate seasonal SQ. In this case, it is assumed that either the meter measures seasonal consumption on separate registers
or the consumption has been split into separate service quantities by other means (like an SQ rule). To determine a
prorated seasonal service quantity, the seasonal proration factor is calculated as for a Prorate seasonal calculation rule.
The seasonal factor is then multiplied by another ratio of total consumption period days to days in the season that are


-----

applicable for the total consumption period. This modified seasonal factor is applied along with the consumption period
factor and calculation period factor to determine the prorated service quantity.

**NOTE:**
**Prorate seasonal SQ. Specify this option only if you can determine the seasonal consumption as an independent service**
quantity for use by rate application. Because the service quantities themselves dictate the applicability of the calculation
rule, a given service quantity need not appear in rate versions effective outside the season (i.e. a rate version effective on
October 1 may not include calculation rules that charge for kWh/summer).

**Override Seasonal Proration. If the seasonal functionality provided with the system does not work for your**
organization, you may override the logic using the Override Seasonal Proration plug-in spot on the installation record.
For example, perhaps the seasonal period is determined dynamically based on the scheduled meter read date of the bill
cycle.

Example ( Prorate ):

Let's say that 600 kWh and 50 kW are the billable service quantities for a consumption period from April 1 to April 30.
Prorate seasonal calculation rules are defined on a monthly rate that charge $0.05 per kWh and $0.75 per kW from January
1 to April 15. Prorate seasonal calculation rules are defined on the same rate version that charge $0.06 per kWh and $0.80
per kW between April 16 and December 31. Assume only one rate version is effective for the consumption period.

- The consumption period factor is 1 (not applicable).

- The calculation period factor is 1.0.

- The seasonal factor for the kWh calculation rule whose season is effective from January 1 to April 15 is 0.5 (15 season
days in calculation period / 30 days in the calculation period).

- The resulting bill calculation line uses service quantity proration:

- 600 kWh x 0.5 (seasonal factor) x $0.05 = $15.00.

- The seasonal factor for the kW calculation rule whose season is effective from January 1 to April 15 is also 0.5.

- The resulting bill calculation line uses calculation rule value proration:

- 50 kW x $0.75 x 0.5 (seasonal factor) = $18.75.

- The seasonal factor for the kWh calculation rule whose season is effective from April 16 to December 31 is 0.5.

- The resulting bill calculation line uses service quantity proration:

- 600 kWh x 0.5 (seasonal factor) x $0.06 = $18.00.

- The seasonal factor for the kW calculation rule whose season is effective from April 16 to December 31 is also 0.5.

- The resulting bill calculation line uses calculation rule value proration:

- 50 kW x $0.80 x 0.5 (seasonal factor) = $20.00.

Example (Prorate seasonal SQ):

Let's say that a given meter measures winter consumption separate from summer consumption. The meter itself measures
kWh/summer on a register between June 21 and September 18, and measure kWh/winter on another register at other times
of the year.

We are generating a bill segment with a consumption period from September 2 to October 30. A monthly rate schedule has
two rate versions effective during the consumption period. The latest rate version is effective on October 1.

Each of the rate version calculation groups have Prorate seasonal SQ seasonal calculation rules defined. The first rate
version's calculation rules charge $0.06 per kWh/summer and $0.05 per kWh/winter. The second rate version calculation
group has a single calculation rule that charges $0.05 per kWh/winter.

Assume that the billable service quantities are 800 kWh/summer and 1600 kWh/winter.

First set of bill calculation lines (September 2 to September 30):


-----

- The consumption period factor is 30 normal days / 60 consumption days = 0.5.

- The calculation period factor is 30 calculation days / 30 normal days = 1.0.

- calculation rule 1 ($0.06 per kWh/summer):

- The seasonal factor 17 seasonal days / 30 calculation days = 0.5666667.

- The modified seasonal factor is 0.5666667 x 60 consumption days / 17 seasonal days = 2.0.

- The resulting bill calculation line:

- 800 kWh/summer x 0.5 (consumption period factor) x 2.0 (modified seasonal factor) x $0.06 = $48.00.

- calculation rule 2 ($0.05 per kWh/winter):

- The seasonal factor is 12 seasonal days / 30 calculation days = 0.4.

- The modified seasonal factor is 0.4 x 60 consumption days / 42 seasonal days = 0.571428.

- The resulting bill calculation line:

- 1600 kWh/winter x 0.5 (consumption period factor) x 0.571428 (modified seasonal factor) x $0.05 = $22.86.

Second set of bill calculation lines (October 1 to October 30):

- The consumption period factor is 30 normal days / 60 consumption days = 0.5.

- The calculation period factor is 30 calculation days / 30 normal days = 1.0.

- Calculation rule 1 ($0.05 per kWh/winter):

- The seasonal factor 30 seasonal days / 30 calculation days = 1.0.

- The modified seasonal factor is 1.0 x 60 consumption days / 42 seasonal days = 1.428571.

- The resulting bill calculation line:

- 1600 kWh/winter x 0.5 (consumption period factor) x 1.428571 (modified seasonal factor) x $0.05 = $57.14.

**FASTPATH:**
For more information on specifying seasonal proration options, refer to Defining Calculation Rules.

###### Price Changes and Interval Quantities

All of the above sections described situations where the service quantities will be prorated due to changes in the price
during the billing period. The above sections assume that the bill contains a simple metering scenario, where reads will not
exist on the date of the price break.

However, consider an interval billing example. There are two basic pricing scenarios for interval quantities:

- Interval prices are applied to interval quantities. In this case, proration is not applicable because the prices are changing
at small intervals and the appropriate usage rules in Oracle Utilities Meter Data Management understand how to apply
the prices to the interval quantities.

- Time of use prices. In this case, interval quantities are being mapped to time of use codes. Oracle Utilities Meter Data
Management can compare interval quantities to a time of use map to create billing determinants for Oracle Utilities
Customer Care and Billing. These will result in new entries in the bill segment's SQ collection when received by Oracle
Utilities Customer Care and Billing. Calculation rules are then apply the appropriate price(s) for each SQ. In the time of
use pricing scenario, it is possible for the prices to change during the usage or billing period. When usage requests are
created by Oracle Utilities Customer Care and Billing, they will contain rate version date breaks to indicate to Oracle
Utilities Meter Data Management to calculate the usage for each rate version period. Proration should not be necessary
when the rate is applied for each usage (rate version) period. However, if prices are configured as bill factors and there


-----

are changes in bill factor values within the usage period, then proration may occur as the date breaks when bill factor
values change are not included in the usage request from Oracle Utilities Customer Care and Billing.

###### Setting Up Estimated Consumption for Items

Some types of physical devices (such as, items) use power but a meter does NOT measure the power consumed. The most
common example is a street light. If this situation exists for your company AND if the amount charged for the lamp varies
based on the amount of estimated power used, then you will have to maintain estimated DAILY consumption for each type
of item. The system uses this information at billing time to estimate how much power was used by the customer's items and
then prices the estimated consumption as per the terms in the service quantity calculation rule.

Select Admin > Rates > Item Type SQ Estimate to define estimated consumption.

**Description of Page**

Select the Item Type using the search.

Enter the estimated daily consumption in the Daily Service Quantity. Each Service Quantity has an Effective Date so that
changes in the estimated quantities may be recorded over time.

**NOTE:**
The unit of measure of the daily service quantity is displayed adjacent to the item type description. This value is defined
on the item type table. Refer to Device Types for more information.

**Where Used**

This information is used when the system calculates a bill segment for a service agreement that references service points
with items. If the items reference item types for which the system should estimate consumption, the system extracts the
daily consumption amount from this table.

###### Setting Up Degree Days (and Average Temperatures)

Many organizations print degree-day and/or average temperature information on their customers' bills. Select Admin >
**Billing > Degree Days > Search to define these values for a given trend area.**

**Description of Page**

The easiest way to define degree days is to select a Trend Area and Month In Year and tab out of the field. The system
generates one row in the Degree Days collection for each day of the month. After the days exist in the collection, you
should define the following for each day:

**Degree Day This is a unit of measure used to express the extent to which temperatures vary from a specific reference**
temperature on a given date.

**Maximum Temperature This is the maximum temperature on a given date.**

**Minimum Temperature This is the minimum temperature on a given date.**

**Average Temperature This is the average temperature on a given date.**

**Where Used**

This information may be used by your bill print routines.

###### United Kingdom VAT and CCL


-----

The topics in this section provide information about value added tax (VAT) and climate change levy (CCL) charges that are
specific to non-domestic customers in the United Kingdom market.

**NOTE:**
**Applicable for UK market. This section is only relevant for the United Kingdom market. Other markets may disregard**
this section.

###### UK VAT Overview

Two rates of VAT, referred to as standard rate VAT and reduced rate VAT, are applicable to energy related charges in the
UK. Domestic (i.e., residential) customers always pay VAT at the reduced rate. Non-domestic customers on the other hand
normally pay standard rate VAT. However, part or all of the energy related charges for a non-domestic customer might be
subject to reduced rate VAT. De minimis and VAT declarations affect the percentage of the energy related charges that is
subject to each VAT rate:

- If average daily usage at a premise for a given service type does not exceed a certain threshold (the de minimis limit), all
energy related charges at that premise / service type are taxed at the reduced rate.

- Some non-domestic customers, such as those with a mixed-use premise, may be eligible to pay reduced rate VAT on part
or all of their energy related charges. Customers may file a VAT declaration specifying the percentage of their energy
related charges that are eligible for reduced rate VAT - refer to Maintaining Declarations for more information. If the
declared percentage exceeds a given threshold, the declared percentage is deemed to be 100% and the customer pays
VAT at the reduced rate on all energy related charges at that premise. VAT declarations are non-transferable and must be
filed for each account, premise, and service type combination.

In addition to the potential for different rates of VAT to be applicable on a bill, UK tax regulations require that excess
credits are considered a prepayment of energy related charges together with VAT. Refer to Excess Credits and UK VAT for
more information.

The system comes supplied with various algorithms types that can be used to perform the VAT calculations.

###### UK CCL Overview

The climate change levy (CCL) is based on the amount of energy used that is subject to standard rate VAT. Similarly to
VAT declarations, customers may file for exemption from CCL. A CCL declaration specifies the percentage of the CCL
charges that the customer is exempt from - refer to Maintaining Declarations for more information. CCL declarations are
non-transferable and must be filed for each account, premise, and service type combination.

CCL charges themselves are subject to standard rate VAT.

###### UK VAT and CCL Bill Examples

The following examples show how a bill for a non-domestic customer is affected by de minimis, VAT declarations, and
CCL declarations. In the examples, standard rate VAT of 17.5%, reduced rate VAT of 5%, a VAT declaration threshold of
60%, and a CCL charge of 0.43p per unit of energy are used.

###### Example 1 - Normal Account


-----

This example shows the bill for a normal non-domestic account with no declarations and consumption above the de minimis
limit. Standard rate VAT is applied to all energy related charges (the standing charge and the per unit charge) and to the
CCL charge.

Bill Line Amount

Standing Charge 10.00

2,000 units @ 10p 200.00

CCL on 2,000 units @ 0.43p 8.60

VAT @ 17.5% on 218.60 38.25

Total 256.85

###### Example 2 - Account with Consumption Under the De Minimis Limit

In this example, consumption does not exceed the de minimis limit and therefore reduced rate VAT is applied to all the
energy related charges. There is no climate change levy because only units subject to standard rate VAT are subject to CCL.

Bill Line Amount

Standing Charge 10.00

2,000 units @ 10p 200.00

VAT @ 5% on £210.00 10.05

Total 220.05

###### Example 3 - Account with VAT Declaration

This example is for a non-domestic account with a VAT declaration of 20%. Consumption is above the de minimis limit.
CCL applies to only 80% of the total units as 20% is subject to reduced rate VAT and therefore exempt. 80% of the energy
related charges (the standing charge and the per unit charge) and all of the CCL charge are subject to standard rate VAT.
20% of the energy related charges are subject to reduced rate VAT.

Bill Line Amount

Standing Charge 10.00

2,000 units @ 10p 200.00

CCL on 1,600 units @ 0.43p 6.88

VAT @ 17.5% on £174.88 30.60

VAT @ 5% on £42.00 2.10

Total 249.58

###### Example 4 - Account with VAT Declaration and CCL Declaration


-----

This example is for a non-domestic account with a VAT declaration of 20% and a CCL declaration of 10%. Consumption is
above the de minimis limit. CCL applies to only 80% of the total units as 20% is subject to reduced rate VAT and therefore
exempt. The customer gets a credit (CCL relief) for 10% of the CCL charges as a result of the CCL declaration. 80% of
the energy related charges (the standing charge and the per unit charge) and all of the CCL charge less the CCL reliefs are
subject to standard rate VAT. 20% of the energy related charges are subject to reduced rate VAT.

Bill Line Amount

Standing Charge 10.00

2,000 units @ 10p 200.00

CCL on 1,600 units @ 0.43p 6.88

CCL relief <0.68>

VAT @ 17.5% on £174.20 30.48

VAT @ 5% on £42.00 2.10

Total 248.78

###### Billing and UK VAT

The following sections describe how VAT rules are implemented when a bill is produced.

###### Application of De Minimis

The de minimis rule specifies that all energy related charges at a premise be subject to reduced rate VAT if the total usage
at a premise does not exceed a certain threshold. To determine if de minimis applies, the total billed consumption for a
premise must therefore be known. However, energy usage at a premise may be measured with several meters and billed by
multiple service agreements. To ensure that the final billed consumption for the premise is used to determine if de minimis
applies, all service agreements for an account of a given service type at a given premise should be billed together and
de minimis should be checked after the bill segments have been generated. In addition, all bill segments on one bill for
consumption at a given premise must be for the same bill period.

**NOTE:**
**Bill segments from different periods may not appear on the same bill. If a bill segment is canceled, all bill segments**
associated with consumption at a given premise for the same service type must be canceled and re-billed together. You
cannot re-bill the bill segment on a bill for a different period.

An Apply De Minimis Rule Customer Class – Pre Bill Completion algorithm type CPBC-DMCH is supplied with the base
package that checks for de minimis at bill completion time. The base bill completion algorithm type checks that for any
service agreement that was billed, bill segments for all the account's service agreements with the same service type and
characteristic premise exist on the bill. It then calculates the total consumption for the premise and determines if de minimis
applies. If de minimis applies, it sets a bill characteristic whose value is the premise ID to indicate that de minimis applies
and regenerates the bill segment. Refer to the Apply De Minimis Rule algorithm type CPBC-DMCH for more information
on how this type of algorithm operates.

For calculation rule-based rates, the Apply VAT to Cross-Referenced Charges calculation rule business object (C1–
**ApplyVatToCrossRefCharge) calculates standard and reduced rate VAT and applies the de minimis rule if the bill**
characteristic for de minimis is found. Refer to Calculation of VAT for more information. Note that during the initial
generation of each bill segment, the characteristic will not exist and standard rate VAT will be applied. This means that if
you look at a bill before it is complete, VAT may not be accurately reflected.


-----

**NOTE:**
**Batch billing cannot regenerate re-billed bill segments. If you cancel and rebill a bill segment, you should complete**
the bill on-line so that the re-billed bill segments can be regenerated if de minimis applies.

###### Calculation of VAT

To calculate VAT, the percentages of energy related charges subject to standard rate VAT and reduced rate VAT must be
determined. As these percentages vary from customer to customer and even from one bill to the next for the same customer,
their calculation must take place at billing time and is handled by the following:

For calculation rule-based rates, the Apply VAT to Cross Referenced Charges business object (C1–
**ApplyVatToCrossRefCharge) is provided to calculate the percentages of energy related charges subject to standard**
rate and reduced rate VAT, taking into account de minimis and any VAT declaration that is in effect for the service type,
account, and premise. The percentages can then be applied to the appropriate charges that are cross-referenced.

###### Calculation of CCL

CCL is a charge per unit of energy subject to standard rate VAT. It is therefore dependent on the same percentage of energy
related charges subject to standard rate VAT determined during the calculation of VAT.

For calculation rule-based rates, a Calculate Climate Levy and Relief Charges calculation rule business object (C1–
**ApplyCCLCharges) is provided to calculate CCL charges and CCL relief, taking into account any CCL declarations that**
are in effect for the service type, account, and premise.

###### Excess Credits and UK VAT

When a financial transaction that results in a credit balance for a service agreement is frozen, the amount of the excess
credit must be accounted for as a prepayment of energy related charges and VAT. VAT is calculated at the reduced rate for
domestic customers and at the standard rate for non-domestic customers. When the excess credit is used, the VAT liability
is reversed.

A Create Excess Credit GL Details Customer Class FT freeze algorithm type CFTZ-VAT-GL is provided to create
additional GL detail entries for unbilled revenue and VAT liability when the freezing of an FT results in a credit balance or
a change to a service agreement's credit balance.

###### Excess Credit GL Accounting Example

The following example shows the additional GL details that are created when a service agreement's balance changes and the
starting or ending balance is a credit. For this example, a single VAT rate of 10% is used simply to illustrate the principle.

The service agreement has a zero starting balance. Note the following:

- When the first payment is received, the overpayment results in a credit balance and additional GL entries are created to
recognize the unbilled energy revenue and unbilled VAT liability.

- When the second bill segment is created, the credit balance is reduced and additional GL entries are created to back out
the unbilled GL entries, up to the amount of the credit balance.

- When the bill segment is canceled, the service agreement again has a credit balance and additional GL entries are created
to recognize the unbilled energy revenue and unbilled VAT liability.

###### Setting Up The System For UK VAT and CCL

The following sections provide an overview of how to configure the system to apply UK VAT and CCL charges for nondomestic customers.

###### Bill Segment Freeze Installation Option

Select Freeze at Bill Completion as the bill segment freeze option. The system determines if de minimis applies at bill
completion time and has to regenerate the bill segments as necessary.

###### Customer Class

Create a separate customer classes for non-domestic customers.

###### Service Agreements

You must configure the system so that each service agreement that must be checked for de minimis is only linked to
service points at a single premise. The service agreement must reference that premise as its characteristic premise. Refer to
Application of De Minimis for more information.

###### Bill Factors for UK VAT and CCL

- Standard Rate VAT


-----

- Reduced Rate VAT

- VAT Declaration Percentage Threshold. Set up a separate bill factor for each service type as the thresholds differ based
on service type.

- De Minimis Average Daily Amount Threshold. Set up a separate bill factor for each service type as the de minimis
amounts differ based on service type.

- Climate Change Levy (CCL) Per Unit Price. Set up a separate bill factor for each service type as the CCL per unit prices
differ based on service type.

###### Characteristic Type for De Minimis Amounts

Set up a characteristic type to use for the bill characteristic that indicates when de minimis applies. Define the type of
characteristic value as a Foreign Key Value and specify a foreign key reference that points to the premise table. Specify this
characteristic type as parameters to the algorithms that apply the de minimis rule and that apply VAT.

You need to define a characteristic type for every service type that is subject to the de minimis rule, as the de minimis limit
may apply for one service type but not another on the same bill.

**NOTE:** A De Minimis Premise Characteristic Type is provided that may be used for a specific service type. For
additional service types, additional characteristic types will need to be defined.

###### Distribution Code

Define the following distribution codes:

- Unbilled Prepaid Energy Related Charges

- Unbilled Prepaid VAT

These distribution codes are required as parameters to the algorithms to create the GL details for excess credit.

###### UOM / TOU / SQI

If using calculation rule-based rates, the calculation rule that calculates CCL requires the consumption that is subject to
standard rate VAT as a service quantity.

Define the UOM / TOU / SQI used to store these service quantities.

###### Service Quantities

If using calculation rules-based rates, the algorithm that checks if the de minimis applies, requires a service quantity
containing the total consumption. Unless you have registers that measure the total consumption independent of time of use
or interval, you will need to set up a pre-processing calculation group with a calculation rule to aggregate the usage into one
service quantity.

###### Algorithms for UK VAT and CCL

Add the following algorithms:


-----

- Apply De Minimis Rule. Define an algorithm for each service type for which de minimis should be checked. Plug the
algorithm(s) in on the customer class for the Pre Bill Completion system event. Refer to the CPBC-DMCH algorithm
type for more information about the base package algorithm.

- Create Excess Credit GL Details. Plug this algorithm in on the customer class for the FT Freeze system event. Refer to
the CFTZ-VAT-GL algorithm type for more information about the base package algorithm.

- Highlight Effective Declarations for Account and Premise. Plug this algorithm in on the installation option for the
Control Central Alert system event. Refer to the CCAL-DECL algorithm type for more information about the base
package algorithm.

###### Calculation Rules to Charge VAT and CCL

Four additional calculation rules are required to charge for VAT and CCL on non-domestic rates:

- Calculate standard rate VAT

  - Calculation Rule Type= Apply VAT to Cross Referenced Charges

  - VAT Calculation Type = Standard Rate

  - Specify the De Minimis Characteristic Type

  - Specify Declaration Percentage Threshold Bill Factor

  - Specify Value Source. It is recommended that you use a value source of Bill Factor and reference the bill factor you
set up for standard rate VAT.

  - Note that the calculation rule overrides description on bill

  - Cross-reference the calculation line category for energy related charges that are subject to VAT

- Calculate reduced rate VAT

  - Calculation Rule Type = Apply VAT to Cross Referenced Charges

  - VAT Calculation Type = Reduced Rate

  - Specify the De Minimis Characteristic Type

  - Specify Declaration Percentage Threshold Bill Factor

  - Specify Value Source. It is recommended that you use a value source of Bill Factor and reference the bill factor you
set up for standard rate VAT.

  - Note that the calculation rule overrides description on bill

  - Cross-reference the calculation line category for energy related charges that are subject to VAT

- Calculate CCL and CCL Relief

  - Calculation Rule Type = Calculate Climate Change Levy and Relief Charges

  - UOM/TOU/SQI = the identifier of the service quantity that the prices applies to

  - Specify Value Source. It is recommended that you use a value source of Bill Factor and reference the bill factor you
set up for standard rate VAT.

  - Note that the calculation rule overrides description on bill

- VAT on CCL

  - Calculation Rule Type = Apply To

  - Value type = Percentage

  - Specify Value Source. It is recommended that you use a value source of Bill Factor and reference the bill factor you
set up for standard rate VAT.


-----

  - Cross-reference the calculation line category for the total CCL and CCL Relief related charges

Setting up the calculation rules as above produces separate lines for VAT on energy related charges and on CCL (i.e., lines
will be created for standard rate VAT on energy related charges, reduced rate VAT on energy related charges, and standard
rate VAT on CCL charges).

You can set up rates to calculate standard rate VAT on energy related charges and CCL together as follows:

- Calculate standard rate VAT charges

  - Calculation Rule Type = Apply VAT to Cross Referenced Charges

  - FCPO = Yes

  - VAT Calculation Type = Standard Rate

  - Specify the De Minimis Characteristic Type

  - Specify Declaration Percentage Threshold Bill Factor

  - Value Source = Value

  - Value = 100

  - Note that the calculation rule overrides description on bill

  - Cross-reference the calculation line category for energy related charges that are subject to VAT

- Calculate CCL and CCL Relief

  - Calculation Rule Type = Calculate Climate Change Levy and Relief Charges

  - UOM/TOU/SQI = the identifier of the service quantity that the prices applies to

  - Specify Value Source. It is recommended that you use a value source of Bill Factor and reference the bill factor you
set up for standard rate VAT.

  - Note that the calculation rule overrides description on bill

- Calculate standard rate VAT

  - Calculation Rule Type = Apply To

  - Value type = Percentage

  - Specify Value Source. It is recommended that you use a value source of Bill Factor and reference the bill factor you
set up for standard rate VAT.

  - Cross-reference the calculation line category for the total CCL and CCL Relief related charges

- Calculate reduced rate VAT:

  - Calculation Rule Type = Apply VAT to Cross Referenced Charges

  - VAT Calculation Type = Reduced Rate

  - Specify the De Minimis Characteristic Type

  - Specify Declaration Percentage Threshold Bill Factor

  - Specify Value Source. It is recommended that you use a value source of Bill Factor and reference the bill factor you
set up for standard rate VAT.

  - Note that the calculation rule overrides description on bill

  - Cross-reference the calculation line category for energy related charges that are subject to VAT

#### Quotes

A quote allows you to show a customer how their bill segments will look if a given set of pricing terms is applied to a given
amount of consumption. If the customer accepts a quote, one or more real service agreements are created.

**FASTPATH:**
Refer to Defining Quotation Options for how to setup the system to enable quotation functionality.

**NOTE:**
**Separate module. Please note that the quoting functionality is part of the Contract Management module. If this module**
is not applicable to your business you may turn it off. Refer to Turn Off A Function Module for more information.

The topics in this section describe the quotation functionality.

##### The Big Picture Of Quotations

The topics in this section provide background information about a variety of quotation features and functions.

**WARNING:**
If you are not familiar with the concepts described under Sales and Marketing, Billing, Rates the quotation functionality
will be difficult to understand.

###### Basic Quotation Concepts

The section describes basic quotation concepts.

###### A Quote Shows How Bill Segments Might Look

A quote shows how a customer's bill segments will look if a given set of pricing terms is applied to a given amount of
consumption. The following example illustrates how a quote might look that provides a customer with two different options
for their electric service. If the customer elects either option, a new service agreement would be created.


-----

Please note the following about a quote:

- A quote is related to an account.

- A quote can contain many quote details. A quote detail shows how bill segments will look if a given set of pricing terms
(e.g., rates, riders, contract quantities, contract options, etc.) is applied to a given amount of consumption.

- A quote detail may contain many simulated bill segments. For example, a quote detail could show the customer what
their monthly bills would be if a given set of pricing terms were used over the course of several months (where each
month has different consumption levels and different prices).

- A quote may contain multiple quote details for the same service. For example, a quote can contain four different pricing
options for the same service (where each option is shown using a separate quote detail). The customer can then compare
them and choose the optimum option.

- A quote may contain quote details for multiple premises and multiple services at each premise. For example, a quote can
contain quote details for electric and gas service at multiple premises.

###### Proposal Service Agreements Must Exist

You cannot create a quote unless its account has at least one proposal service agreement (SA). A proposal SA contains the
pricing terms, legal terms, and template consumption used to generate the simulated bill segments that appear on a quote. It
might be helpful to view a proposal SA as special type of service agreement that is ignored when a bill is produced for an
account.

The topics in this section provide detailed information about proposal SAs.

###### Proposal SAs Contain Pricing Terms

The pricing terms (e.g., rates, contract quantities, riders, bill factor values, etc.) used to generate a quote detail's simulated
bill segments reside on a special type of service agreement (SA) referred to as a "proposal SA". Proposal SAs are like real
SAs in many respects. In fact, you can view and change a proposal SAs pricing terms using the same transaction used to
maintain real service agreements (i.e., service agreement maintenance).


-----

**NOTE:**
**Quote details are rather empty. A quote detail doesn't contain the pricing terms or template consumption. Rather, a**
quote detail references a proposal SA and the proposal SA contains the pricing terms and template consumption.

###### Legal Terms and Conditions May Be Specified On Both Proposal And Real SAs

In addition to containing pricing terms, proposal SAs also contain the legal terms and conditions (T&Cs) that govern the
proposal.

Your master list of terms and conditions are defined when you setup your control tables. The system defaults a service
agreement's T&Cs from the start option used to initially create it. You can change a SA's T&Cs at will.

**NOTE:**
**Real SAs and proposal SAs can reference T&Cs. Both proposal and real SAs can reference T&Cs. The T&Cs on a**
proposal SA are those that will apply if the customer accepts the related quote detail. The T&Cs on a real SA are those
that apply while the SA is active.

###### Proposal SAs Contain Billing Scenarios And Template Consumption

In addition to the pricing terms and the legal terms and conditions, a proposal SA also contains billing scenarios. A billing
scenario defines:

- The number of simulated bill segments that will be generated when a quote detail is produced for the proposal SA.

- The bill period of each simulated bill segment.

- The amount of consumption to be priced under each simulated bill segment. Note this statement is only true for noninterval consumption. Note: Proposal SAs that use interval consumption are not supported in C2M. Load curves and
_TOU mapping are handled in Oracle Utilities Meter Data Management._

A proposal SA's billing scenarios can be created as follows:


-----

- A plug-in spot exists onSA type called Proposal SA Creation. Algorithms plugged into this spot can setup billing
scenarios. Refer to Enabling The Automatic Generation Of Billing Scenarios for more information about how to do this.

- A user can add / change / delete billing scenarios on a proposal SA using Service Agreement - Billing Scenario.

###### Proposal SAs Differ From Real SAs

A proposal SA is just like any other SA in that it contains the pricing terms that are used to generate how much the
customer owes for service. In fact, the service agreement maintenance transaction is used to maintain both types of service
agreements (however, you cannot use this transaction to create a proposal SA; proposal SAs can only be created using the
order transaction).

However, there are differences between proposal SAs and real SAs:

- Billing ignores proposal SAs.

- Proposal SAs cannot have financial transactions.

- Proposal SAs are not subject to credit and collections.

- Proposal SAs do not appear on lists of "active" SAs in the system's various zones, grids and trees.

- Fieldwork is not performed for proposal SAs.

- A proposal SA's state transition is very different from a real SA. Refer to The Lifecycle Of A Service Agreement for an
illustration of a real SAs state transition. Refer to Proposal SA State Transition for an illustration of a proposal SAs state
transition.

###### Proposal SA State Transition

The following diagram shows the possible lifecycle of a proposal SA.

You should never see an Incomplete proposal SA as this is a transitory state used when a proposal is first initiated using
the Order transaction. The system always transitions such proposal SAs to the Pending state. Please note that when a
proposal SA becomes Pending, the system executes any Proposal SA Creation algorithms plugged in on the proposal SA's
SA type. You might use such algorithms to generate billing scenarios or initiate a workflow process that requests template
consumption from the prospect.

A proposal SA exists in the Pending state while you are working on the proposal. For example, you might want to leave the
proposal SA in this state while you wait for the prospect to send you their historical consumption.


-----

A proposal SA is Quotable when a quote detail can be generated for it (at least one billing scenario must be linked to the
proposal SA before it can become Quotable ). Note, proposal SAs can be modified when they are Quotable.

**NOTE:**
**Automatically transitioning a proposal SA to the Quotable state when it's first created. As described earlier, you**
can setup a proposal SA creation algorithm to automatically create billing scenarios when a proposal SA is created. The
base package algorithm can also automatically transition the proposal SA to the Quotable state (thus making it ready for
quotation). Refer to Enabling The Automatic Generation Of Billing Scenarios for more information.

A proposal SA becomes Accepted when a customer accepts one of its quote details.

A proposal SA becomes Declined when a customer declines one of its quote details (or its quote expires). A Declined
proposal SA can be "reopened" (by making it Quotable ). You may need to do this if you want to change a proposal SA's
terms in preparation of generating a new quote detail.

A proposal SA becomes Canceled when a quote detail is withdrawn (or its quote expires). You may need to do this if you
want to change a proposal SA's terms in preparation of generating a new quote detail.

Incomplete, Pending and Quotable proposal SAs may be deleted.

###### Orders Are Used To Create Proposal SAs

Proposal SAs can only be created using the order transaction. This transaction allows a user to pose eligibility-oriented
questions to a customer or prospect. The system determines which packages of goods and services for which they are
eligible based on the answers to the questions. If the customer is interested in receiving a package, one or more SAs (real
and/or proposal) are created using the SAs To Create information defined on the selected package.

**NOTE:**
**You must setup campaigns and packages before you can create an order. If you are not familiar with the order**
transaction, you should take the time to form an intuitive understanding of the concepts described under Sales &
Marketing. With this knowledge in place, you can design and set up the campaigns and packages necessary to allow an
order to create proposal SAs. Keep in mind that a single switch controls whether real SAs or a proposal SAs are created
when a package is selected on the order transaction. This switch resides on Package - SAs To Create.

**A package could create a combination of real and proposal SAs. When a customer elects to take a package of goods**
and services (via the order transaction), the system creates a service agreement for each SA type / start options defined
on the package's SAs To Create. It is possible to setup a package to create both real and proposal SAs. For example, the
customer may be calling you to start electric service, but they may also be interested in seeing a proposal for gas service.

**You don't create special SA types for proposal SAs. The SA type on a proposal SA is the same as the SA type on the**
real SA that's created when the proposal SA is accepted. This is because the business rules on your SA types govern
both real and proposal SAs.

**You don't need special start options for proposal SAs. The start options that you setup to default information onto**
new, real service agreements are also referenced on the SA To Create information used to create proposal SAs.

###### Proposal SAs May Be Grouped Under An Umbrella Agreement

Each proposal SA may be part of a larger contract for multiple services that you are negotiating with a customer or group
of customers. You may use an umbrella agreement and its collection of terms of service records to group together multiple
proposal service agreements.


-----

###### Creating Quotes And Quote Details

Once an account has quotable proposal SAs, you can generate a quote for the account using the quote maintenance
transaction. When you generate a quote for an account, you can include quote details for any / all of the account's quotable
proposal SAs.

The logic used to create a quote detail's simulated bill segments is not hard-coded. Rather, the system calls the algorithm
plugged in on the proposal SA's SA type in the Proposal SA - Bill Segment Generation plug-in spot. Refer to Enabling The
Generation Of Simulated Bill Segments for information about this plug-in spot.

The major difference between a bill segment linked to a quote detail and one linked to a bill is that a quote detail's bill
segments are calculated using simulated consumption. This means that the financial information on quote details is not a
guess - it's what the bill would be if a given amount of consumption was priced using the pricing terms (as long as you opt
to use rate application to calculate the simulated bill segments).

In addition to this major difference, there are a few minor differences between a real bill segment and a simulated bill
segment:

- A quote detail bill segment does not have a foreign key to a bill. Rather, it references a quote detail.

- A quote detail bill segment's prime key is inherited from its quote detail (rather than its bill).

- A quote detail bill segment can never have a financial transaction linked to it.

- A quote detail bill segment doesn't have read details.

- A quote detail bill segment's state transition is simpler (it's either in the Error state or OK ).

###### Completing A Quote Creates Quote Routings (And More)

When a quote's quote details are all OK, you change the status of the quote to complete to indicate the quote is ready to be
sent to the customer or prospect.

When a quote is completed, the system creates a quote routing for each person who receives a copy of the account's quotes.
When you indicate a person should receive a copy of the account's quotes, you define the routing method (e.g., email, fax,
post) and the appropriate address.

**NOTE:**
**Recipients of quotes. You define who receives a copy of an account's quotes on the Account - Persons page. The**
system assumes (by default) that the main person linked to the account should receive the account's quotes. You can
subsequently indicate any person linked to the account should receive its quotes (and turn off the creation of quotes for
the main person). In addition, you can manually add additional quote routings to a quote if you need to send the quote to
individuals not currently linked to the account. Refer to How To Reprint A Quote for more information.

The information that appears on the quote routing record is controlled by thequote route type specified on the respective
account / person information:

- If the quote route type’s routing method is email or fax and the system has been configured to use notification
preferences for quote routing, a quote routing is created for each active contact preference whose notification type is
associated with the quote route type specified on the respective account / person information. Refer to Bill and Quote
Routing in Designing Notification Types for more information. Otherwise, quote routings are created as follows:

  - If the quote route type indicates the person's quotes are routed via fax, the person's fax number is used as the routing
information. The system knows which of a person’s person contacts is a fax number is by the contact routing or which
of a person's phone numbers is a fax number by the phone type.


-----

  - If the quote route type indicates the person's quotes are routed via email, the person's Email address is used as the
routing information. The system knows which of a person’s person contacts is an email or knows where to find the
person email.

- If the quote route type indicates the person's quotes are routed via the postal service, the address constituents are
populated with the address specified on the bill address source that is also specified on the account / person information.
Note, if the person has a seasonal address effective on the business date, the seasonal address will be used regardless of
the value of bill address source.

Regardless of whether the quote is routed via fax, email or post; the routing record is also stamped with the batch process
and run number that performs the download of the quote information. The batch process is defined on the quote route type.
Refer to Printing Quotes for more information about this batch process.

In addition to creating routing information at completion time, the system executes any quote completion algorithms
plugged in on the account's customer class. For example, you may want to create a workflow process to manage the
processing of the quote. To do this, you plug in a Quote Completion Algorithm that creates a workflow process on the
respectivecustomer class.

###### Accepting / Declining Quote Details

A customer can accept or decline each quote detail on a quote.

When a quote detail is accepted, the system:

- Changes the state of the related proposal SA to accepted.

- Executes the Proposal SA - Acceptance algorithms plugged in on the proposal SA's SA type. The base package algorithm
creates a real SA by copying the information from the proposal SA. The real SA is created in the pending start state.
This new SA behaves similarly to a pending start SA that's created via the Order or Start/Stop transactions (e.g., field
activities are initiated if the SA type has been setup accordingly).

When a quote detail is declined, the user must supply a decline reason. The system then changes the state of the related
proposal SA to declined.

**FASTPATH:**
Refer to Proposal SA State Transition for more information about a proposal SA's states.

**NOTE:**
**Reopening a declined proposal SA. If a customer changes their mind about a declined proposal SA, you can return it to**
the quotable state using the service agreement maintenance transaction.

**Rejecting an entire quote. If all details on a quote are being declined, you can simply change the state of the quote to**
closed rather than reject each quote detail. Refer to Closing Quotes for more information.

###### Tinkering With Proposal SAs After Quote Generation

The system allows a quotable proposal SA to be changed, EVEN IF QUOTE DETAILS HAVE BEEN GENERATED. This
is intentional as otherwise you would have to create an entirely new proposal SA if you wanted to send another quote for
slightly different terms. Your technical team could always introduce a user exit to prevent this from happening if you really
didn't want this to take place.

Because the system allows this, a potential issue is that the customer may end up accepting a proposal SA that differs from
the terms on their quote (e.g., you could change the SA after the quote detail is generated). For this reason, we snapshot the


-----

version number of the proposal SA on the quote detail at the time it's generated. If a proposal SA is accepted and its version
number differs from the value on its quote details, a warning is produced.

A warning is also issued if you change a proposal SA and a quote detail exists (reminding you to generate a new quote /
quote detail).

In addition to the above, it's also important to understand that the system intentionally allows multiple quotes to reference a
given proposal SA. This allows you to leave multiple quotes open that reference the same proposal SA(s).

###### Closing Quotes

Every quote has an expiration date. The CLOSEQTE background process closes quotes on their expiration date. This
process changes the state of all related proposal SAs to canceled or declined (an input parameter of this process controls
which state is used).

You can also close a quote real time using the quote maintenance transaction. When you do this, the system asks if the
related proposal SAs should be left as quotable or if they should be changed to canceled or declined.

**NOTE:**
**Reopening a declined proposal SA. If a customer changes their mind about a declined proposal SA, you can return it to**
the quotable state using the service agreement maintenance transaction.

###### Alerts

The alert zone highlights if:

- The selected account has pending or complete quotes. Refer to Quote Lifecycle for more information.

- The selected account has pending or quotable proposal SAs. Refer to Proposal SA State Transition for more information.

###### Trees

The account tree highlights:

- The existence of non-closed quotes

- The existence of proposal SAs and their related quote details

###### Printing Quotes

The contents of this section describe the technical implementation of printing quotes.

###### Quote Routings Are Created For Each Recipient Of A Quote

Refer to Completing A Quote Creates Quote Routings for a description of how the system constructs the information used
to route a quote to one or more recipients.


-----

###### Quote Route Types Control The Information Merged Onto Quotes

Every quote routing references a quote route type.

The quote route type controls the following quote functions:

- It contains an algorithm that is responsible for extracting the information merged onto your quotes. Specifically,
algorithms of this type create the "flat file records" that are passed to your quote-print software. Algorithms of this type
are called under the following scenarios:

  - The background process that builds the flat file that's passed to your quote-print software calls these algorithms to
construct the "flat file records" for each quote. Refer to Technical Implementation of Printing Quotes In Batch for the
details.

  - If your quote-print software has the ability to construct a real-time image of a quote (in a PDF), you can plug in an
Online Quote Display algorithm on the Installation Record. This type of algorithm calls the quote's dispatch group
extract algorithm to extract the information that is merged onto the quote. Refer to Technical Implementation Of
Online Quote Display for the details.

- Refer to The Quote Extract Records for examples of the record layouts passed to the document composition application.

- It contains the ID of the background process that builds the flat file that's passed to your quote-print software. The base
package example of this background process (QUOTROUT) simply calls the extract algorithm on the routing record's
route type to format the information placed onto the flat file.

**NOTE:** CIS Division can override the extract algorithm and/or the background process found on the quote route type.
The system processes first check the quote’s account’s CIS Division for an override specific for the quote route type.

###### Technical Implementation Of Online Quote Display

Users can view an image of any quote if you set up the following:

- Plug in an Online Quote Display construction algorithm on the Installation Record. Refer to ONQD-DOC1 for an
example of such an algorithm. Note if your quote-print software is not capable of producing a PDF containing an image
of a quote, users will not be able to view images of quotes.

- Plug in the appropriate extract algorithm on each quote route type. Algorithms of this type format the records that contain
the information that is passed to your printing software. Refer to QTEX-EX for an example of such an algorithm.

When you plug in these algorithms, a button appears on Quote - Main. When a user clicks this button, the following takes
place:

- The installation record's Online Quote Display algorithm is executed.

- This algorithm calls the quote's route type's extract algorithm. This algorithm constructs the information that's merged
onto the quote and returns it to the Online Quote Display algorithm. This algorithm, in turn, passes it to the quote-print
software.

- The quote-print software renders an image of the quote in a PDF and returns it to the Online Quote Display algorithm.

- And finally, the Online Quote Display algorithm displays the PDF in a browser session. Note that the client must have
Adobe Acrobat Reader installed to view PDF files.

###### Technical Implementation Of Printing Quotes In Batch


-----

The batch process that extracts quote information reads all quote routing records in a given run number that are marked
with its batch control ID. For each quote routing record, it creates numerous records on a flat file. These records contain the
information that is merged onto your quotes.

The base package example of this process (QUOTROUT) simply calls the extract algorithm on the routing record's route
type to format the information placed onto the flat file. Refer to Quote Route Types Control The Information On Quotes for
more information.

**NOTE:**
**If your software doesn't support online quote display. The algorithm that formats quote extract records that's plugged**
in onquote route type serves two purposes: 1) it formats the records used to construct online images of a quote, and 2) it
formats the records downloaded to your quote print software in batch. If your quote printing software does not support
the rendering of quote images real time, there is no need to create an extract algorithm. Rather, you should simply
develop your own download process that both formats the extract records and downloads them (and then specify this
batch process on your quote route type).

###### Reproducing The Quote Print Flat File

You can reproduce the flat file at any time. Simply request the quote production background process and specify the run
number associated with the historic run.

###### How To Reprint A Quote (For The Original Recipients or For Someone New)

A copy of a quote is sent to every individual / business specified in the quote's routing details. The system creates the
routing details when a quote is completed. Refer to Completing A Quote Creates Quote Routings for more information
about how this information is compiled during quote completion.

If you want to reprint a quote OR if you want to send a quote to someone other than the original recipients:

- Navigate to the Quote - Main page.

- Transfer to the Quote - Quote Routings tab.

- Insert a new row (click the + button). Note that you can only insert information on a quote that is Complete.

- Specify the name and address to which the quote should be sent. If you want to send the quote to someone other than the
original recipient, specify the individual's name and address.

- Save the quote.

If a quote is Complete but the print process hasn't yet executed, you may change the name and address on the original
routing details; you don't have to insert a new routing row.

###### The Quote Extract Records

Numerous different types of records are interfaced to the document composition application. However, they all share a
common structure:

- The first 4 bytes are called the Printer Key. This field is a record type used by the document composition application
quote template.

- The next X bytes are called the Sort Key. This field is used to ensure the various records used to construct a printed
quote appear in the correct order in the interface file.


-----

- The next 12 bytes are called the Mailing Key. This field is used to control the order in which the formatted quotes are
printed.

- The remaining bytes contain the QuoteInformation that appears on the printed quote. The type of information differs for
each type of record.

The topics in this section describe each component.

##### Maintaining Quotes

A quote allows you to show a customer how their bill segments will look if a given set of pricing terms is applied to a given
amount of consumption. If the customer accepts the quote, real service agreements are created.

**FASTPATH:**
Refer to The Big Picture Of Quotations for background information about quotes.

The topics in this section describe how to maintain quotes.

###### The Lifecycle Of A Quote And Quote Detail

The topics in this section describe the lifecycle of the various quote objects.

###### Quote Lifecycle

The following diagram shows the possible lifecycle of a quote.

Pending A quote starts its life in the Pending state. Refer to Creating Quotes And Quote Details for more information.

A quote remains Pending until you Cancel or Complete it.

You may delete a Pending quote. Deleting a pending quote also deletes its quote details.

Canceled You cancel a quote if you want a record of a Pending quote that was never sent to a customer.

Complete A quote becomes Complete when it is ready to be sent to a customer. No changes may be made to a Complete
quote. Refer to Completing A Quote for a description of what happens when a quote is completed.

A Complete quote may be reopened. You would only do this if you need to prevent blatant errors from being sent to
the customer. For example, if you notice an incorrect quote detail, you could reopen the quote, regenerate or delete the
erroneous quote details, and then recomplete the quote.

Closed A Complete quote becomes Closed when its terms are no longer valid. Refer to Closing Quotes for more
information.


-----

###### Quote Detail Lifecycle

The following diagram shows the possible lifecycle of a quote detail.

When a quote detail is generated, it is placed in the Error or Ok state depending on whether the system successfully
generated simulated bill segments for each billing scenario linked to the related proposal SA. A quote detail may be deleted
if its parent quote is Pending. Refer to Creating Quotes And Quote Details for more information.

###### Quote - Main

This page is used to maintain quotes. This page provides many diverse functions:

- You can generate, complete, close, reopen, and cancel a quote.

- You can regenerate and delete quote details.

- You can accept, decline and cancel the proposal SAs that contribute a quote detail to the quote.

You should not attempt to use this transaction until you are comfortable with the concepts described under The Big Picture
of Quotations.

Open this page using Menu > Sales & Marketing > Quote > Search.

**Description of Page**

**Quote Info contains a concatenation of important information about the quote (e.g., its expiration date and status). Quote**
**ID is the system-assigned unique identifier of the quote. These values only appear after the quote is added to the database.**

**Account ID identifies the customer or prospect associated with the quote. The name of the account's main customer appears**
adjacent.

**Quote Status contains the state of the quote. Refer to Quote Lifecycle for information about the valid values and the state**
transition rules.

If your system has been configured to display an online image of a quote, a Display Quote button appears adjacent to the
quote's status. When clicked, an online image of the quote is displayed. Refer to Technical Implementation Of Online Quote
Production for how to enable this feature.

**Expiration Date / Time identifies when the quote's terms are no longer valid. Refer to Closing Quotes for how the system**
uses this information to automatically close a quote.

Refer to Quote Actions for a description of each Quote Action button.

This transaction has sophisticated logic that can be used to perform mass updates to the quote's quote details and their
related proposal SAs. These mass update actions are executed by selecting quoted details (in the grid) and then clicking
the desired action button at the bottom the page. The remainder of this section describes how to use this mass update
functionality.


-----

The Select All / Clear All buttons are used to select / unselect the quote details. These buttons are disabled when the quote
is Closed.

**NOTE:**
**100 quote details at a time. Clicking Select All selects the first 100 quote details in the grid. If more than 100 quote**
details exist, you must select them in batches.

The grid that follows contains the quote details linked to the quote. The following information appears in the grid:

- Select box. Before you can perform any of the mass update actions at the bottom of the page, at least one quote detail
must be selected. This field is disabled when the quote is Closed. You can use the Select All and Clear All buttons to
change the value of the switch for all quote details in the grid.

- Click the go to button to transfer to the Quote - Quote Detail tab with the corresponding quote detail positioned in the
scroll. On this page, you can see the details of the quote detail's simulated bill segments (and, from there, drill down into
the details of each bill segment).

- The Quote Detail Info column contains a concatenation of a quote detail's division, SA type, start option, status, start
date, and premise information (this information comes from the quote detail's proposal SA).

- The Total Amount column contains the sum of the quote detail's simulated bill segments.

- The Remarks column highlights special circumstances associated with the quote detail.

  - Proposal SA has been changed since the quote was created appears if the proposal SA was modified after the quote
detail was generated. If you'd like to recalculate this quote detail, select this row and click the Regenerate button at
the bottom of the page to regenerate the quote detail's simulated bill segments.

  - Quote detail contains bill segments in error appears if any of the simulated bill segments linked to the quote detail are
in error . Click the adjacent go to button to transfer to the Quote - Quote Detail tab where the state of each simulated
bill segment is shown. You can correct simulated bill segments that are in error by Regenerating the quote detail (and
you do this by selecting the quote detail and clicking the Regenerate button at the bottom of the page).

The Quote Detail Actions and Proposal SA Actions can be used to perform mass updates to the selected quote details in
the grid. Refer to Quote Detail Actions and Proposal SA Actions for the details.

###### Action Buttons On Quote Main

The topics in this section describe the various action buttons on the Quote - Main page.

###### Quote Actions

The topics in this section describe the Quote Action buttons on the Quote - Main page. The following links are provided so
that you can move easily to specific topic within this section:

- Generate

- Complete

- Close

- Reopen

- Cancel (Quote)

**Generate**

The Generate button causes one or more quote details to be created for the account's Quotable proposal SAs. This button is
enabled when there is at least one Quotable proposal SA linked to the selected Account ID.


-----

When clicked, the Generate Quote window opens.

You must specify the following parameters to generate quote details:

- Indicate if quote details should be created for All Proposal SAs or for a Specific Proposal SA.

- If you indicated a quote detail should be generated for a Specific Proposal SA, also specify the Proposal SA ID.

After specifying the parameters, click Generate to create the quote details for quotable proposal SAs.

**FASTPATH:**
Refer to Creating Quotes And Quote Details for more information.

**WARNING:**
If the quote has existing quote details for the designated proposal SAs, they are deleted when you generate quote details
(i.e., the system regenerates existing quote details). You can also regenerate quote details by selecting them on the Main
page and clicking the Regenerate button.

Top of Page

**Complete**

The Complete button causes the quote to become complete. This button is enabled when the quote is pending and all quote
details linked to the quote are OK.

**FASTPATH:**
Refer to Completing A Quote Creates Quote Routings for a description of what happens during quote completion.

Top of Page

**Close**

A quote is closed when its terms are no longer valid (i.e., when the related proposal SAs can no longer be accepted). Most
quotes are closed automatically by the system (refer to Closing Quotes for how this takes place).

If you want to close a quote real time, click the Close button. When this button is clicked, the system opens the Close
**Quote window and asks if anything should be done with the related proposal SAs.**

In the resulting window, you must specify one of the following Proposal SA Actions:

- Choose No Action if you don't want to change the status of the related proposal SAs.

- Choose Decline if you want the status of the proposal SAs that have contributed quote details to the quote to be changed
to declined . You must also define a Decline Reason.

- Choose Cancel if you want the status of the proposal SAs that have contributed quote details to the quote to be changed
to canceled .

Top of Page

**Reopen**

The Reopen button causes a quote to return to the pending state. You would only reopen a quote if you need to prevent
blatant errors from being sent to the customer. For example, if you notice an incorrect quote detail, you could reopen the
quote, regenerate or delete the erroneous quote detail, and then recomplete the quote.

This button is enabled if the quote is complete.

Top of Page

**Cancel (Quote)**


-----

The Cancel button causes the quote to become canceled. You would cancel a quote if you want a record of a pending quote
that was never sent to a customer. This button is enabled when the quote is pending.

Canceling the quote does NOT cancel the related proposal SAs. If you want to cancel the related proposal SAs, you have the
following options:

- You can click the Close button rather than the Cancel button. When you close a quote, you are given the option of also
canceling the proposal SAs that contributed a quote detail to the quote.

- Before canceling the quote, you can select the quote details and click the Cancel button at the bottom of the page (in
the Proposal SA Actions section). When you click this button, the system cancels the proposal SAs linked to the quote
details.

- You can transfer to the Quote - Quote Details tab and then drill down to the each proposal SA (using the SA context
menu button). This transfers you to Service Agreement - Main where you can cancel the proposal SA.

###### Quote Detail Actions

The topics in this section describe the Quote Detail Action buttons on the Quote - Main page. These buttons are used to
perform a given action to the quote details that are selected in the quote details grid.

- The Regenerate button is used to delete and recreate the selected quote details. This button is enabled if the quote is
pending and at least one row in the quote details grid is selected.

- The Delete button is used to delete the selected quote details. This button is enabled if the quote is pending and at least
one row in the quote details grid is selected.

###### Proposal SA Actions

The topics in this section describe the various Proposal SA Action buttons on the Quote - Main page. These buttons are
used to perform a given action to the proposal SAs associated with the selected quote details.

The Accept button is used to accept the proposal SA associated with the quote detail. This button is enabled if the quote is
pending or complete and at least one row in the quote details grid is selected.

When you accept a proposal SA, you are asked to supply the Start Date of the real service agreement that will be created.

Refer to Accepting / Declining Quote Details for more information about how accepting a quote detail causes a real service
agreement to be created.

Decline

The Decline button is used to decline the proposal SA associated with the quote detail. This button is enabled if the quote
is pending or complete and at least one row in the quote details grid is selected. When you decline a proposal SA, you are
asked to supply a Decline Reason.

Refer to Accepting / Declining Quote Details for more information about declining a quote detail.

Cancel

The Cancel button is used to cancel the proposal SA associated with the quote detail. This button is enabled if the quote is
pending or complete and at least one row in the quote details grid is selected.

###### Quote - Quote Details

This page is used to view a summary of the simulated bill segments linked to a quote detail.


-----

Open this page using Menu > Sales & Marketing > Quote > Search and navigate to the Quote Details page to define
this information. You can also display a quote detail by clicking the respective go to button in the quote details grid on the
main tab.

**Description of Page**

**Quote Info contains a concatenation of important information about the quote (e.g., its expiration date and status). Quote**
**ID is the system-assigned unique identifier of the quote. These values only appear after the quote is added to the database.**

The Quote Details scroll contains one entry for every quote detail linked to the quote (a summary of these quote details also
appears on the Main tab). The remainder of this section describes the information displayed for each quote detail.

**NOTE:**
**You don't have to use the scroll. If the quote has many quote details, you don't have to use the scroll to work through**
them. Rather, you can use the go to button in the quote details grid on the main tab to position the respective quote
detail in the following scroll. Also note, you can use Alt - and Alt + to scroll to the next and previous quote details in the
scroll.

**You cannot maintain quote details on this page. All maintenance functions (generate, delete, accept, decline and**
cancel) are performed on the Main tab.

**Premise Info is the address of the main premise associated with the service agreement (as defined on the service**
agreement's characteristic premise). It's important to note that the service agreement may cover service at multiple premises,
but only one may be defined as the main premise.

**Quote Detail ID is the system-assigned unique identifier of the quote detail.**

**SA Info is a concatenation of the proposal SA's division, SA type, start option (if any), status and start date.**

**SA Version is a snapshot of the proposal SA's version number at the time the quote detail was generated. This information**
is used by the system to detect if the proposal SA was modified after the quote detail was created.

**Total Amount is the sum of the quote detail's simulated bill segments.**

**Create Date / Time is the date and time the quote detail was generated.**

**Remarks highlight special circumstances associated with the quote detail. Please see the description of this field on the**
main tab for more information.

The grid contains a row for each simulated bill segment linked to the quote detail. The following information appears in the
grid:

- The first go to button transfers you to the bill segment page where the details of the simulated bill segment are shown.

- **Bill Segment Period defines the start and end dates of the simulated bill segment.**

- **Amount contains the amount of the bill segment.**

- **Remarks highlight special circumstances associated with the bill segment.**

- **Billing Scenario ID allows you to go to the proposal SA's billing scenario where you can tinker with consumption and**
the bill segment period used to generate this bill segment. Refer to Proposal SAs Contain Billing Scenarios for more
information.

###### Quote - Quote Routings

This page is used to view the recipients of a quote. Refer to Printing Quotes for a discussion of how this information is used
to produce quote images.

This page is also used to request a new copy of a quote.

**NOTE:**


-----

**No routing information until completion. A quote has no routing information until it is complete. At completion time,**
the system creates a routing detail for every person linked to the account that receives a copy of its quotes. Refer to
Printing Quotes for more information about how this information is constructed.

Use Menu > Sales & Marketing > Quote > Search and navigate to the Quote Routings page.

**Description of Page**

**Quote Info contains a concatenation of important information about the quote (e.g., its expiration date and status). Quote**
**ID is the system-assigned unique identifier of the quote. These values only appear after the quote is added to the database.**

The Quote Routing Information scroll contains an entry for each recipient of the quote. This information is disabled after
the quote has been routed to the recipient. The remainder of this discussion describes the fields that can be defined for each
recipient of the quote.

**Person ID identifies the person who was originally associated with the routing record. You may change the Person ID to**
any person in the system as this information is only used to default the recipient's name and address information, below.

The Quote Routing Parameters area contains information explaining how and when the quote is routed to the recipient.
This information is gray when the quote routing information has been extracted or if a quote is reopened:

- **Quote Route Type is the method used to transmit the quote to the customer. This information defaults from Account -**
Person Information.

- **Batch Control is the identifier of the batch of quotes in which the recipient's copy was downloaded. Embedded in this**
identifier is the batch control ID and the batch number. Note, this batch process is defined on the Quote Route Type or
CIS Division.

- **Sequence is the system-assigned identifier assigned to this quote routing.**

- Turn on Do Not Extract if the quote should not be routed to the individual for whatever reason.

- **Reprint is checked if an operator created this routing. This switch is populated by the system and is always protected.**

- **Extract Date/Time is the date and time the quote was downloaded. This information only appears after the download**
has commenced.

The Mailing Address Information area contains the recipient's name and address.

- If the recipient has anoverride mailing name, Name1, Name2 and Name3 contain the person's override mailing name.
Otherwise, Name1 contains the recipient's primary name (this name might also include a prefix or suffix if the related
Account - Person relationship has these fields defined).

- The remaining fields are the recipient's address. Refer to Completing A Quote Creates Quote Routings (And More) for
information about how the system constructs the recipient's address

- If the recipient's address is a mailing address (as opposed to fax or email), the Country associated with the address
controls the fields that appear in the address. Refer to Defining Countries for more information on the address
constituents.

- If a user manually adds a routing record, the mailing address information defaults from the information on the current
routing record.

- If a user specifies a Person ID that is linked to the quote's account, the Quote Route Type defined for this person on the
account is defaulted.

- If a user specifies a Person ID that is not linked to the quote's account, the Quote Route Type on the installation record
is defaulted. Note, if the quote route indicates the quote is routed via the postal service, the system will only be able to
default the person's address if the person has an override mailing address on their correspondence information.

- If the user changes the Quote Route Type after the initial default, the system populates the address information as
described above.

#### Service Credits

"Service credits" is a term used to describe a special program designed to reward a customer for service along with benefits
related to such a program. For each program that a customer participates in, there is a service credit membership record.
Service credit events are used to record the "points" earned and redeemed for the membership. The topics in this section
provide further details related to the service credit functionality.

**FASTPATH:**
For information about designing and setting up your control tables for configuring service credit functionality, refer to
Designing Your Service Credit Options.

**NOTE:**
**Service credits are optional. Service credits may not be set up in your system; they are only used if your company**
offers rewards programs to customers.

**Penalty Points. The service credits functionality is described in the documentation with the assumption that it is used**
for accumulating points to reward your customers. However, if your company has a business need to record penalty
points for a customer, the service credits functionality may be used for that purpose as well.

##### The Big Picture Of Service Credit Membership

If a customer is participating in a rewards program, the customer has a service credit membership. The topics in this section
provide background information about a variety of service credit membership features and functions.

###### Who are the Members?

Each membership has one or more "members". The members are defined by the accounts linked to the membership and by
the financially responsible person(s) linked to each account.

A typical membership is linked to only one account. However, in some cases more than one account is linked to the
membership. For example, a customer may have one account for residential service and one for commercial service,
but both accounts are part of the same membership. In this example, one person with multiple accounts is linked to the
membership, so there is only one member.

For each account linked to the membership, the service related to the account may be used to calculate the accumulated
credits for the membership. Refer to How Are Service Credits Earned? for more information.

**NOTE:**
An account may not be linked to more than one membership of the SAME membership type at a given point in time. In
other words, an account may not have two United Airlines frequent flier memberships (otherwise, the account would
accumulate double miles). However, an account may be linked to more than one membership if they are of different
membership types. For example, an account may have a capital credits membership and a United Airlines frequent flier
membership.

When you find a customer's record on Control Central - Search, you are transferred to the Account Information portal. One
of the zones on this page contains information about memberships for the customer.


-----

**NOTE:**
**Portal Preferences. The service credit membership zone only appears if you have modified your preferences to display**
this zone. Refer to Portal Preferences for more information.

###### Joint Membership

It is possible for more than one person to belong to the same membership. These persons may be linked to the same account
or to different accounts. A typical scenario would be a married couple that shares in a membership. This is considered a
"joint" membership.

The number of "members" for a membership is mainly for information purposes and typically has no bearing on the service
credit amounts calculated for the membership. There may be legal restrictions or business practice restrictions controlling
how you may set up your members. For example:

- In an airline's frequent flier program, a separate frequent flier account would exist for each customer. It is possible for
you to create a frequent flier membership with more than one "member", but for the system, the important information
is the external frequent flier miles number linked to the membership. The customer linked to this number accumulates
the miles. For this case, your business practice may be that the person with the frequent flier account must be the only
financially responsible person.

- For a capital credits membership, you may be required to distinguish between "single" memberships and "joint"
memberships. If a single person gets married and would like the spouse to be added as a member, your practice may be
to expire the single membership and to create a new "joint" membership to include both spouses.

**NOTE:**
**Co-op Members. Do not confuse the "members" of a co-op with the members linked to a service credit membership.**
At a cooperative, most customers are considered "members" of the co-op. However, in the system, separate membership
records are created for each single or joint membership.

###### Changing the Membership Accounts

The link between the accounts and the membership is NOT effective dated. This means that if the list of accounts for a
membership changes, you need to stop the membership and start a new one with the new list of accounts.

**NOTE:**
**Stopping Memberships. Stopping a membership does not necessarily prevent new service credits from accumulating.**
Refer to Stopping a Membership vs. Inactivating a Membership for more information.

###### Membership Application

Your business practice may dictate that the customer complete an enrollment form. Depending on your practice, the form
may need to be received prior to starting membership or it may simply be a mechanism to gather supplemental information
once the membership has begun.

Either way, you may consider setting up the system to handle forms as follows:

- Design your membership type to include a creation algorithm that generates a letter when the membership is created. The
letter template could include the form to be filled out.


-----

- Create the new membership in pending status. The letter and form are sent to the customer and the pending status
indicates that you are waiting for the completed form. Refer to the Lifecycle of a Membership for more information.

- When the paperwork is received, change the status of the membership to active.

**NOTE:**
**Membership Events for Pending Memberships. The system allows events to be created for pending memberships**
assuming that paperwork is supplemental information that should not prevent service credits from accumulating. If your
business practice dictates that the paperwork must be received prior to accumulating service credits, the algorithm or
background process that creates events for memberships of this type should be coded to only create events for active
memberships. Refer to How Events Are Created for more information.

###### Creation of a Membership

Memberships may be created using the membership page when a customer has signed up for a special program. In addition,
it may be your business practice to automatically create a membership under certain circumstances when a customer has
signed up for service.

For example, if you are a co-op, perhaps every new customer is automatically enrolled in a capital credits membership.
Or perhaps signing up for cable service automatically entitles your customers to membership in the free pay-per-view
movies program. For these cases, the recommendation is to use the order page to start service for your customer and to use
questions and miscellaneous fields to record information needed to set up the new membership correctly. Refer to Using
Campaigns & Packages to Create a Membership.

###### Membership Fees

Some memberships may require a fee to be paid by the customer when joining. The behavior of this fee may differ
depending on whether it is refundable or not.

- If the fee is nonrefundable, you create an SA with a simple adjustment or a one time billable charge to levy the fee. Refer
to Defining Control Tables for a Nonrefundable Fee.

- If the fee is refundable, in addition to defining the SA to hold the fee, you need to put code in place to initiate the refund.
Refer to Setting Up a Refundable Fee for more information.

###### Stopping a Membership vs. Inactivating a Membership

You may stop a membership by entering an end date for the membership. However, depending on how events are created
for your membership, stopping the membership may not prevent new events from being created. For example:

- If you stop a frequent flier membership on May 15th and a bill is subsequently created for the period May 1st through
June 1st, your business rules may dictate that frequent flier miles should be accumulated for this bill because the
membership was active for part of the period covered by the bill.

- For a capital credits membership, capital credit allocations are calculated for the prior year. If a membership stopped
in the middle of the previous year, the membership should still get capital credits for the part of the year that the
membership was still in effect.

- Capital credit retirements are calculated based on capital credit allocations accumulated in the past. If a membership has
been expired, the members are still eligible for retirement amounts for the accumulated capital credit allocations. These
retirements may continue for many years after a membership is stopped.


-----

**NOTE:**
**Membership Status. For all the above scenarios, the system assumes that the status of the membership remains active.**

You may have some circumstances where you do not want new events to accumulate after a membership is stopped. To
prevent new events from being created, you must change the status of the membership to inactive.

If a customer moves away or otherwise stops service with your company, your business rules dictate whether or not the
membership should be stopped or changed to inactive. The following issues must be considered:

- Will service credit events still get created for these memberships? If so, is that acceptable?

  - For frequent flier memberships, the miles are calculated based on new bill amounts for the membership's service
agreements. If the SAs that contribute to the membership are expired, no new bills are generated so no new miles are
accumulated.

- For capital credits, after a customer moves away, the capital credit allocation for the final year of the customer's service
may still need to be calculated. In addition, this customer is eligible for the capital credit retirement amounts, even
though they are no longer a customer.

- What happens if the customer returns to your company and signs on for service again? Assuming that the same account
number is used, is it ok for the membership to be automatically reinstated? Or should the customer reapply? If the
customer should reapply, you may consider updating the membership with a stop date when the customer originally
stopped service.

**NOTE:**
There is nothing in the system logic that automatically updates the membership stop date or the status when service
agreements that contribute to the membership are stopped.

##### The Big Picture of SC Events

The service credit events record the accumulation and redemption of awards earned by the membership. The topics in this
section provide background information about a variety of service credit event features and functions.

**NOTE:**
**Events. For convenience, this document often refers to service credit events simply as "events".**

###### Event Amounts May Contribute to a Balance

The event amount may be positive or negative, based on whether the event is accumulating points earned for the
membership or redeeming points for the membership. For some types of memberships, these credit and debit amounts
should be added together to produce the overall balance for the membership.

For some types of memberships, a balance is not applicable. This is true for memberships where the redemption of the
points does not occur within the system. For example, if the membership accumulates frequent flier miles on behalf of
an airline, the customer redeems the earned miles with the airline, not with your company. As a result, there is no need to
calculate a balance for the membership.

If you want the system to calculate a balance, you must set a switch on the membership type page. For memberships that
calculate a balance, the balance may be viewed on the membership page.


-----

###### Events May Indicate a Fiscal Year

For some types of memberships, the amount of each event is associated with a specific fiscal year. This is true for capital
credit memberships where capital credit allocations are calculated for a fiscal year. When the capital credits are redeemed
(also called retired), the retirement events must also indicate a fiscal year. Because all events for this type of membership
are related to a fiscal year, the system can calculate the balance for the events by fiscal year.

If you want the system to require a fiscal year for every event in the membership, you must set a switch on the membership
type page. For memberships that calculate a balance and indicate a fiscal year, the balance for each fiscal year may be
viewed on the membership page.

###### Events May Indicate a Subcategory

For some types of memberships, the amount of each event is further grouped by a subcategory. This is common for capital
credit memberships where multiple capital credit allocations are calculated. For example, each year, you may calculate
allocations for generation and for transmission. Events for memberships of this type must indicate a subcategory.

Cooperatives that allocate capital credits for more than one subcategory, typically want to view the balance of the events
over time broken down into these subcategories. When the capital credits are redeemed or retired, the retirement events
must also indicate a subcategory. Because all events for this type of membership are related to a subcategory, the system
can calculate the balance for the events by subcategory.

**NOTE:**
**Partial Retirement. For some cooperatives, it is common that certain capital credit allocations are never retired. Refer**
to Partial Retirement for more information.

If you want the system to require a subcategory for every event in the membership, you must define the valid subcategories
on the membership type page. For memberships that calculate a balance and indicate a subcategory, the balance for each
subcategory may be viewed on the membership page.

**NOTE:**
**Calculating Subcategory Balances. If events for your membership indicate a subcategory and fiscal year, balances for**
the membership are calculated for both groupings.

###### An Event May Cause Other Actions to Occur

When an event is generated, there are often other actions that need to take place. For example:

- If an event is created that allocates points for the customer, you may want to generate a temporary message on the
customer's next bill.

- If a capital credit allocation event is created, the general ledger is affected so an adjustment must be created to post to the
general ledger. Refer to Financial Transactions for an Event for more information.

- If an event is created to add frequent flier miles, the event must be marked for extraction so that the information is sent to
the appropriate airline. Refer to Interface Membership Information to a Third Party for more information.

- If an event to retire capital credits is created, the customer's balance is affected so an adjustment must be created to
transfer the capital credit to the members' service agreements. Refer to Financial Transactions for an Event for more
information.


-----

The system relies on algorithms linked to the event type to perform the actions described above and any other action that
may be required by your business.

**FASTPATH:**
Refer to Service Credit Event Types for more information about the algorithms provided with the base product.

**NOTE:**
**Event Cancellation Algorithms. The event type also defines algorithms to be executed when an event is canceled.**

###### Financial Transactions for an Event

An event may be related to financial transactions. There are two types of financial transactions that may be linked to the
event:

- Financial transactions that contributed to the event. These are bills, payments or adjustments that caused the event to be
created. For example, if you generate an event for frequent flier miles as a result of some amount billed for the customer,
the bill segments associated with the billed amount are linked to the event. The FTs are linked to the event for audit
purposes.

- Financial transactions that are created by the event. In an event may cause other actions to occur, we saw examples
where an event completion algorithm may cause adjustments to be created. The FT ID for these adjustments is linked to
the event as audit.

**NOTE:**
**Automatically Canceling Event Financial Transaction. The created by financial transactions may get canceled if the**
event is canceled AND you have plugged in an appropriate Event Cancellation Algorithm.

For financial transactions that are created by the event, the system must post the financial transactions to one or more
appropriate service agreements. The service agreement to use depends on your business rules. For example:

- If the event affects the balance of accounts linked to the membership, the event completion algorithm may create
adjustments for service agreements that contribute to the membership.

- If the event affects the general ledger and does not affect any balance for the account, the event completion algorithm
simply needs a service agreement to use for the resulting adjustment. Rather than arbitrarily picking any service
agreement in this case, a special miscellaneous service agreement should be linked directly to the membership for such
adjustments.

###### How Events Are Created

Although a user may create an event manually on the service credit event page, most events are created automatically by an
algorithm or by a background process. The following topics further describe these options.

###### Events Created by an Algorithm

You would design an algorithm to create your events if the event should be triggered by an occurrence in the system, such
as starting service or generating a bill. For example, perhaps every time you are billed for electric and/or gas service, the
system adds one frequent flier mile for every $10 spent on service. Refer to How Are Service Credits Earned? for more
information.


-----

The base product provides a bill completion algorithm to create an event as a result of the amount billed for service
agreements linked to the membership. Refer to CBCM-SC for more information.

###### Events Created as a Result of a Background Process

You would use a background process to create the event if the calculation is done periodically or on an ad-hoc basis and
does not get triggered by something occurring in the system. For example, the capital credit allocation and retirement
processes are typically run once a year, when the business has determined that they are ready to calculate these amounts.

**FASTPATH:**
Refer to Allocating Capital Credits and Capital Credit Retirement for more information.

###### Creating Pending Events

Events may be created in pending or complete status. Only complete events cause the completion event algorithms to run
and cause other actions to occur. You may use the status of pending if you want to review the calculated amount prior to
completing the event.

For example, when a cooperative runs the background process to allocate capital credits, it may create the new events in the
pending status. This allows the co-op to review the total amount of capital credits calculated for all members. If this total
is in line with the co-op's expectations, they run the background process again creating the new events in complete status.
Only at this point do the completion event algorithms run.

###### Events May Be Transferred

In some situations, you may want to transfer service credit events from one membership to another on the service credit
event page. For example, if a member dies, you may decide to transfer earned service credits to the membership for a
beneficiary. When transferring a service credit:

- The target membership must be of the same membership type as the original membership.

- The original service credit event is canceled and any event cancellation algorithms linked to the SC event type are
executed.

- A new service credit event is created and completed and any event completion algorithms linked to the SC event type
are executed.

- The new service credit event references the original event ID in the Transferred From event field.

**NOTE:**
Contributed to FTs linked to the original event are not transferred to the new event. If you have created by FTs linked
to the original event, the recommendation is to ensure that an event cancellation algorithm cancels this FT and that an
event completion algorithm for the new event creates an appropriate new FT for the new membership.

###### CPCRALOC - Allocating Capital Credits

The base product provides a background process (CPCRALOC) that allocates capital credits to members of a cooperative.
The result of this process is the creation of new service credit events for capital credit memberships. This background


-----

process is typically run after the profits for the previous year are calculated. During that time, this job could be run a number
of times for any of the following reasons:

- At the beginning of the allocation process, you may know the total amount to allocate to all members; however, you may
estimate the allocation factor that determines the individual amounts that get distributed to the members. You may need
to change your estimate and rerun the process until all the individual allocations add up to the desired total amount. To
run the job with the estimated allocation factors, indicate that you want events created as pending. When you confirm the
correct allocation factor, a final run should be executed with an indication that the events should be created as complete.
Every time the process runs, it will first remove any pending events for the same input event type, subcategory and fiscal
year. Refer to Creating Pending Events for more information.

- If the cooperative has more than one subcategory, the process must be run for each subcategory. In fact, the above trialand-error process may need to be followed for each subcategory.

You must provide the service credit event type to use for the new events. This process determines the membership type
related to the event type. The process then finds all pending and active memberships for this membership type. To calculate
the capital credit allocation, the system finds all applicable bill segments for each service agreement that contributes to the
membership.

Capital credit allocations are calculated for a specific fiscal year. The fiscal year is input to the background process and
is stamped on any new events created by the process. The system also uses the fiscal year to determine the applicable bill
segments for the membership's SAs. It uses the bill segment's accounting date and the accounting calendar to determine the
fiscal year for each bill segment.

**NOTE:**
**Canceled Bill Segments. Any bill segments that were canceled in the fiscal year are included as well.**

**Accounting Calendar. This process assumes that only one accounting calendar exists for the company. This is the case**
for companies that operate in a single jurisdiction, which is true for cooperatives.

**Allocation Period. If the membership was only effective for part of the fiscal year, the allocations are only calculated**
for the period of time that the membership was in effect.

For each applicable bill segment, the system determines the SQ total and the total sales amount for each segment. To
calculate the totals correctly, a characteristic type and value to identify SQ bill lines must be provided to the background
process and a characteristic type and value to identify bill lines contributing to the total sales amount must be provided to
the background process.

**FASTPATH:**
Refer to Identifying SQ and Sales Information for Historical Bill Segments for more information.

If your membership type indicates subcategories to be used for the events, you must provide a subcategory as input. If you
have multiple subcategories for your membership, this process must be run once for each subcategory.

The calculation of the capital credit allocation amount typically uses an allocation factor. This factor is often different for
each subcategory. You will probably define a different bill factor for each subcategory and use the appropriate bill factor
when submitting the process for each subcategory.

This process also assumes that the allocation factor differs by the customer's revenue class. It assumes that the bill factor's
characteristic type is revenue class. Refer to Designing Bill Factors for Credit Allocation for more information. For each
service agreement linked to the membership, the appropriate allocation factor is determined based on the revenue class for
the SA type.

Capital credits for the input subcategory are calculated as follows:

Fiscal year sales amount - (fiscal year SQ amount * revenue class allocation factor) = Allocation Amount

The calculated amount is compared against a minimum amount, input to the background process. If the calculated amount is
less than the minimum, no event is stored for this amount.


-----

After determining the amount, a new service credit event is created for the membership. The event is stamped with the input
subcategory, service credit event type and fiscal year.

The FTs for all the bill segments used to determine the allocation amount are linked to the event as contributed to FTs.
Refer to Financial Transactions for an Event for more information.

**NOTE:**
**Rerunnable Process. This process is restartable and rerunnable. When running the process, for each membership the**
system checks whether there is already a complete event for the input service credit event type, subcategory and fiscal
year. If so, it does not create a new event.

**FASTPATH:**
Refer to CPCRALOC for more information.

###### CPCRRETR - Capital Credit Retirement

**NOTE:**
**Calculation Method. There are various calculations that different cooperatives may use when determining the amount**
to retire. The base product has provided one calculation method.

This background process is run when a cooperative is ready to pay out allocated capital credits to its members. This
process is referred to as retirement. The result of this process is the creation of new service credit events for capital credit
memberships. Capital credits are paid as the cooperative's financial position permits. During that time, this job could be run
a number of times for any of the following reasons:

- You may choose to run the process and create pending events to review the results prior to finalizing the retirement.
When you are happy with the results, a final run should be executed with an indication that the events should be created
as complete. Every time the process runs, it will first remove any pending events for the same input event type and
subcategory.

- If the cooperative has more than one subcategory, the process may be run separately for each subcategory. You may also
run the process with no subcategory indicated and then all subcategories are processed.

**NOTE:**
**Partial Retirement. For some cooperatives there may be capital credits for some allocated amounts that are never**
retired. If that is the case, simply run this process for each subcategory whose amounts do get retired.

You must provide the service credit event type to use for the new events. This process determines the membership type
related to the event type. The process then finds all pending and active memberships for this membership type.

This process receives a percentage to retire as input. It determines the current balance of all completed events for the
subcategory. The retirement amount for the subcategory is calculated as the current balance * input percentage to retire. The
process then determines the outstanding balance for each subcategory and fiscal year combination. For every combination
that still has a balance, the process creates events to relieve the outstanding balance for the oldest fiscal year first. It creates
events for subsequent fiscal years until the full retirement amount is used.

In order for the process to be rerunnable and restartable, a Control ID is used to mark retirement events that are created
by the process. The Control ID is input to the routine and is determined by the user. When the process runs, it determines
whether an event already exists for the subcategory / Control ID combination. If so, new events are not created for that
subcategory. If you run the process multiple times for the reasons described above, you should use the same Control ID
each time. This way the system knows that the process is being run again for the same retirement calculation.

The topics in this section describe how to maintain service credit memberships. Refer to The Big Picture Of Service Credit
Membership for background information about memberships.

###### Lifecycle of a Membership

The following diagram shows the possible lifecycle of a service credit membership.

Pending A service credit membership may start out in the Pending state. A membership is typically created in this state
if the creation of the membership requires approval or any manual step (e.g. waiting for paperwork) that needs to be
completed prior to activation.

**NOTE:**
**Events for Pending Memberships. Service credit events may still be created for membership records in the Pending**
state.

Active A service credit membership is in the Active state when a customer is actively participating in a service credit
membership. A membership may be created in the Active state or it may transition to the Active state from Pending when
all the necessary approval or paperwork is complete.

**NOTE:**


-----

**Manual Activation Only. There is no system functionality that automatically changes the status of a membership from**
Pending to Active. This is a manual step.

Inactive If a customer is no longer actively participating in a service credit membership, change the status to Inactive. This
will prevent any new events from being created for the membership.

Enter the Service Credit Event Amount. If your service credit membership type indicates that your membership has a
balance, this amount is used to calculate the overall balance for the membership as well as a balance for the subcategory
and/or fiscal year, if applicable.

If this event was created as a result of a transfer from another membership, the Transferred From Event ID is displayed.

If the information about this event may be downloaded to a third party system, you should have an event completion
algorithm that stamps the appropriate Batch Control and Batch Number onto the event.

The FT collection displays information about financial transactions related to this event. Two different categories of
financial transactions may be linked to the event.

- FTs that contributed to this event. These financial transactions played a part in the creation of this event. For example, if
frequent flier miles are earned as a result of newly created bill segments, the FTs related to these bill segments are linked
to the event and marked as contributed to FTs. This information is purely for audit purposes. It is the responsibility of
the algorithm or background process that creates the event to populate the collection of contributed to FTs. Refer to How
Events Are Created for more information.

**NOTE:**
The amount of the contributed to FTs will not necessarily add up to the amount of the event. Refer to the algorithm or
background process that calculates the amount of the event to understand how the event amount is calculated based on
the amount of the contributed to FTs

- FTs that were created by this event. These financial transactions are created as a result of this event. For example, if you
have generated a capital credit allocation event, perhaps you need to post information to the general ledger. An allocation
event should therefore generate an adjustment to post the effect on the GL. The adjustment's FT is linked to the event as
an audit. In order to create a financial transaction related to this event, you must plug in an appropriate event completion
algorithm on your service credit event type.

#### Loans

There are many reasons why your company may loan money to customers. For example, your company may loan money to:

- Finance service upgrades (e.g., to change to dual fuel)

- Support economic development (e.g., to extend a power line)

- Promote energy conservation (e.g., customers borrow to insulate their house)

**NOTE:**
**Loans are optional. You need only set up loans if your organization loans money to customers. For information on**
setting up the system to enable loans, refer to Defining Loan Options.

##### The Big Picture Of Loans

The topics in this section provide background information about loans.

###### Loans Are Service Agreements

Loans are initiated by creating a loan service agreement for a customer. The loan service agreement (and its SA type)
contains the loan's terms, including the loan amount, periodic payment amount, the number of amortization periods, the
interest rate, and the periodicity of the bills. Loan service agreements are just like other service agreements in many ways:

- The system bills the customer for the periodic payment amount using information on the service agreement.

- The customer pays the billed amount.

- If the customer doesn't pay, credit and collections may start a collection process to encourage the customer to pay
(depending upon how the loan debt class has been set up on your system).

Loan service agreements differ from other service agreements in the following ways:

- Loans have interest charges.

- Loans have amortization schedules.

- Loan SAs are maintained on a separate transaction (refer to Loan - Main for more information).

**NOTE:**
**Loan service agreements are created using Start/Stop. Loan service agreements are created using start/stop just like**
all other service agreements. The start/stop transaction has special loan functionality that allows an operator to specify
the service agreement-specific loan terms described above. A start option can be specified to override the SA type's
interest bill factor.

###### Loan Interest Charges

When a bill is generated for a loan, the interest charge is calculated using an algorithm. The base package loan interest
charge algorithm type (LINT-SI) calculates simple interest based on:


-----

- Unbilled principal (i.e., the payoff balance minus the current balance)

- The number of billing periods covered by the bill

- The interest rate

**NOTE:**
**No interest on interest and no interest on past due amounts. Just like a classic home loan, the base package**
algorithm does not calculate interest on interest, nor does it calculate interest on past due amounts. However, your
system may be set up to levy a late payment charge.

After the interest charge is calculated, the bill segment FT algorithm generates the financial transactions for the bill. The
base package FT algorithm generates a financial transaction that adds the interest charge to the payoff balance. In other
words, if the customer wanted to pay off the loan, they would owe the principal balance plus the interest charge.

**FASTPATH:**
For more information, refer to Billing For Loans And Interest Calculation.

###### Loan Amortization Schedules

A loan's periodic payment amount is calculated such that the customer repays the loan in equal amounts over the term of
the loan (with the exception of the first and last bill segments, which are typically for different amounts). The amortization
schedule is a projection of the amount of principal and interest in each payment over the life of the loan. The amortization
schedule may change, for example if the interest rate changes or the customer makes an overpayment (reducing the
principal balance).

The amortization schedule is a theoretical projection of the future. The term theoretical is used because the customer's actual
payments can cause the schedule to change. For example, if a customer overpays a bill, the loan's length decreases and the
amount of principal and interest in each scheduled payment changes.

A loan's amortization schedule is calculated when you click the Calculate button on Loan - Main. When this button is
clicked, an algorithm plugged in on the loan SA type actually calculates the amortization schedule.

You can view a loan's latest amortization schedule using Loan - Main. You can also change the loan's payment periods or
periodic payment amount on this page and recalculate the loan's amortization schedule.

###### Negative Amortization

The system does not allow you to use a periodic payment amount that is less than the periodic interest amount. If it did, the
customer's payoff balance would increase over time (this is referred to as "negative amortization"). There are two methods
you can use to specify a payment amount in the system. Depending on which method you use, the system informs you of
negative amortization differently:

- If you enter a payment amount that is too small on the Start confirmation page or in the Renegotiate Future Payments
grid on Loan maintenance, you get an error message when you click the Calculate button. You must fix the payment
amount before you can start the loan or save your changes.

- If you manually override the Payment Amount on Loan maintenance, you can save a payment amount that is too small
to cover the interest charges. However, the system notifies you that it is not able to calculate the Forecasted Schedule
because of negative amortization. Additionally, bill segments for the loan SA are produced in error until the payment
amount is adjusted appropriately.


-----

###### Loan Overpayments

Overpayments reduce the principal amount (the amount owed on the loan), which follows the philosophy adopted by a
typical home loan. When the payment is made, any overpayments are distributed according to the overpayment distribution
algorithm defined for the customer class. Typically, loan service agreements should be set up so that the overpayment is
applied to the principal balance.

When the payment transaction is frozen, the system checks to see if there is a credit amount on the loan SA's current
balance. If a credit exists, the customer has made an overpayment and an adjustment is created to transfer the amount of the
credit from the SA's current balance to its payoff balance, thus reducing the principal by the amount of the overpayment.

**FASTPATH:**
For more information about the adjustments created for loan overpayments, refer to Overpayments On Loans.

**NOTE:**
**Overpayments and interest. The base package interest calculation algorithm (plugged in on the loan's SA type) does**
not take into consideration the exact date that the overpayment is made when calculating the interest for the period.
It only takes into consideration the outstanding principal amount (payoff balance - current balance) at the time of the
interest calculation.

###### The Lifecycle Of A Loan

Loans have the same lifecycle as other service agreements (e.g., pending start, active, pending stop ). You should rarely
have to manually change a loan service agreement's status. Why? Just like other service agreements, the system changes
the status behind-the-scenes when various events take place. For example, loans in the pending start state are automatically
activated by a system background process.

If you need to manually change a loan service agreement's status (e.g., you need to cancel a loan that was inadvertently
started), you can do so from Service Agreement - Main.

###### Finalizing And Closing A Loan

A loan SA is automatically stopped when the last bill segment is generated for the loan. If the remaining principal balance
(plus accrued interest) is less than or equal to the loan payment amount, the SA status is changed to pending stop and the
bill segment is marked as the closing bill segment. The SA can then be stopped by the user (manually using the SA page) or
by the SA activation background process. When the customer pays the last bill, the loan SA is closed.

**FASTPATH:**
For more information about transitioning SAs from pending stopped, refer to Finalizing Pending Stops.

###### Navigating To The Loan Maintenance Page

Any of the following methods can be used to navigate to the Loan Maintenance transaction:

- A user can set up a favorite link associated with the loan transaction.


-----

- Via any of the following menus:

  - Account context menu

  - Service agreement context menu

  - Menu

**NOTE:**
**Alerts and Loans. If the loan SA type is set up with an alert, the Alert Zone highlights if a loan exists for the current**
account. You are transferred to the SA maintenance transaction (not the loan maintenance transaction) if you drill down
on the alert.

##### Loan Maintenance

You can use loan maintenance to view the loan's amortization schedule and financial history as well as to change the terms
of a loan, including the loan amount (prior to SA activation only), interest rate, payment amount and number of payment
periods.

**NOTE:**
**Starting Loans. You cannot start a loan from Loan - Main; you must use Start/Stop. Refer to How To Start A Loan**
Service Agreement for information.

Open Menu > Customer Information > Loan > Search to maintain a loan.

**Description of Page**

The fields at the top of the page are informational only. The Payoff Balance is the total amount owed by the customer
(excluding any interest that may have accrued since the last bill). The Current Balance is the amount currently owed by the
customer. The Principal Balance is the total principal amount left unbilled. Refer to Payoff Balance and Current Balance
for Loans for more information.

The Loan Amount is the amount originally loaned to the customer. The Standard Interest Rate is the standard interest
rate defined on the loan's SA type. If the SA type allows, the standard interest rate may be overridden by a start option and/
or manually. The Next Payment Amount is the effective periodic payment amount as of the next bill.

The Payment(s) shows the number of payments that were used to calculate the original loan schedule.

The Override Interest Rate grid is used to override the standard interest rate. The interest rate can only be modified if the
loan's SA type allows it. Note that changing the interest rate changes the loan amortization schedule. To override the interest
rate:

- Specify an End Date for the override rate in effect if there is one.

- Click + and specify the Start Date and the new Interest Rate. You can also specify the End Date of the new override
rate, but this is not required.

The Payment Amount grid is used to maintain the effective periodic payment amount. Note that changing the payment
amount changes the amortization schedule. To change the payment amount:

- Click + and specify the Effective Date and the new payment Amount.

**NOTE:**
**Entering a payment amount that is too small. If you save a payment amount that is too small to cover the periodic**
interest charges, this causes negative amortization. The system is not able to recalculate the amortization schedule and
bill segments are produced in error until the problem is corrected.


-----

The History grid shows the loan's financial history in reverse chronological order. The financial history grid displays the
following information:

- The Arrears Date is used to compute how many days old the debt is. In the context of a loan, debt only refers to the
billed amount (the amount the customer needs to pay to stay current).

- **Financial Transaction Type displays the type of financial transaction except for adjustments. For adjustments, the**
adjustment type's description is shown.

- **Current Amount is the effect of the FT on the service agreement's current balance.**

- **Current Balance is the amount owed by the customer at the time of the transaction.**

- **Payoff Amount is the effect of the FT on the service agreement's payoff balance. The value is grayed out if it is the same**
as the current amount.

- **Payoff Balance is the total amount owed by the customer. The value is grayed out if it is the same as the current balance.**

**WARNING:**
If you do not understand the difference between payoff balance and current balance, refer to Payoff Balance And
Current Balance For Loans.

The Forecasted Schedule displays the loan amortization schedule. The first row of the schedule shows the current
cumulative interest, current cumulative principal and the current principal balance. All other rows show the future
amortization schedule based on the loan details. The forecasted schedule includes the following information:

- The Loan Period displays the forecasted payment period dates based on the billing frequency and the payment
periodicity. The Loan Period is blank for the first row, which shows current cumulative amounts.

- The Amount displays the projected amount of that payment. The Amount is zero for the first row, which shows current
cumulative amounts only.

- The Interest displays the projected amount of interest in the payment amount. The Amount is zero for the first row,
which shows current cumulative amounts only.

- The Principal displays the projected amount of principal in the payment amount. The Amount is zero for the first row,
which shows current cumulative amounts only.

- The Cumulative Interest is the total interest amount that would theoretically be billed at that loan period.

- The Cumulative Principal is the total principal amount that would theoretically be billed at that loan period.

- The Principal Balance is the remaining principal balance that would theoretically be remaining at the loan period.

**NOTE:**
**Forecasted schedule. The loan schedule algorithm calculates the values in the forecasted schedule. Depending on the**
algorithm set up for your installation, the values may have a different meaning.

The Renegotiate Future Payments area allows you to change the terms of the loan. You can modify the following options:

- You can modify the Loan Amount only if the SA has not been activated. After the SA is activated, this field is for
information only.

- The Interest Rate allows you to change the interest rate. When changing the interest rate, specify either the number of
payment amounts or the payment amount and click Calculate to recalculate the amortization schedule.

- The Number of Payment Periods allows you to change the number of periods remaining in the loan's term. The
**Frequency displays the periodicity of the payments. If you change the number of payment periods, use the Calculate**
button to recalculate the payment amount.

- The Payment Amount allows you to change the amount of individual payments. If you change the payment amount, use
the Calculate button to recalculate the number of periods.


-----

- The Calculate button recalculates the payment amount (when you specify the interest rate and the number of payment
periods) or the number of payment periods (when you specify the interest rate and the payment amount) and recomputes
the loan amortization schedule based on these new terms.

**NOTE:**
**Implementing New Loan Terms. The changes that you make using Override Interest Rate, Payment Amount and**
**Renegotiate Future Payments do not take effect until you save the loan. Changes made to the Renegotiate Future**
**Payments section are only valid for save after you click Calculate, and they override any other changes.**

**Saving Renegotiated Future Payments. When you save a loan that has renegotiated payments, the system may add**
new records for the override interest rate, payment amount, or both. It uses the start date of the next loan period as the
start date of the new interest rate and/or as the effective date of the new payment amount. If the loan has not yet been
billed, the system updates the interest rate and/or payment amount created when the loan was started.

##### How To

The topics in this section describe how to perform common loan functions.

###### How To Start A Loan Service Agreement

Loan service agreements are created using start/stop just like all other service agreements. The start/stop transaction has
special loan functionality that allows an operator to specify the service agreement-specific loan terms described above.

Creating a loan service agreement involves the following steps:

- Select the account on Control Central then open Start/Stop.

- Enter a Start Date and a Start Method of Start a SA.

- Indicate the CIS Division / SA Type of the loan service agreement and click the Start button.

**NOTE:** If the service agreement’s account’s CIS Division’s Restrict to Account CIS Division flag sis set to
_Restricted, the CIS Division is set to the account’s CIS Division and cannot be changed._

- After you click Start, the Start Confirmation page appears. When you select a loan service agreement type, the Start
Confirmation page displays special fields that allow you to specify the loan's terms.

- Select a loan Start Option. The start option includes the adjustment type for booking the principal amount, and can
also include defaults for the initial loan amount, periodic payment amount, payment periods, and interest rate. The
system uses the information on the start option to populate the service agreement's default parameters. You can manually
override these parameters:

  - Enter the Loan Amount (the amount that the customer is borrowing). Note that the label for the Total Amount To
Bill (e.g., Loan Amount) may appear differently depending on how the SA type was defined.

  - The system can automatically calculate either the payment amount (based on the loan amount and the payment
periods) or the payment periods (based on the loan amount and the payment amount). Enter either the Payment
**Amount or the Payment Periods and click Calculate. Note that the label for the Recurring Charge (e.g., Payment**
Amount) may appear differently depending on how the SA type was defined.

  - Once the loan parameters are populated, click Start.

The loan is created in the pending start state. The next time the SA activation process runs, it will activate the loan SA. If
you want to activate the loan immediately, navigate to the service agreement page and click Activate SA.


-----

**NOTE:**
**Overriding the Interest Rate. The Interest Rate is a display only field. The interest rate is taken from the value of**
the interest bill factor defined on the SA type or the contract value of the interest bill factor on the start option if one is
defined. After starting a loan, you can manually override the interest rate usingLoan - Main if the SA type allows it.

**Changing The Loan Amount. You can use loan maintenance to change the loan amount for an SA as long as the SA**
has not yet been activated. It may be helpful to transfer toLoan - Main, and verify the amortization schedule before
activating the SA.

###### How To Modify The Terms Of A Loan

After a loan is active, you may want to modify its terms. You can change number of payment periods, the payment amount,
and the interest rate (if allowed by the SA type). To modify the terms of a loan:

- Navigate to the Loan maintenance page.

- If you used the account context menu, the loan you want to modify may be displayed. If not, use the search dialog that
appears to search for and select the loan you want to modify.

- In the Renegotiate Future Payments section, change the interest rate (if allowed), the number of payments, or the
payment amount. Note that either the number of payments or payment amount must be blank.

- Click Calculate. The Forecasted Schedule is recalculated along with either the new payment amount or the new number
of payments (depending on which was left blank).

- If the renegotiated payments are satisfactory to the customer, save the changes.

When you save the changes, appropriate entries are made in the Override Interest Rate and Payment Amount grids.

**NOTE:**
**Saving Loan Modifications. You must save the renegotiated payments after clicking Calculate for the loan**
modifications to be effective.

###### How To Adjust Loans

You issue ad hoc adjustments if you need to change a loan's principal and/or current balance outside of the normal billing
and payment functions.

An adjustment can:

- Change a loan's payoff balance.

- Change a loan's current balance (i.e., how much the customer thinks they currently owe).

- Change both the loan's payoff and current balance.

**FASTPATH:**
For details about the adjustment types to apply, refer to Adjusting Loan Amounts. For information about creating
adjustments, refer to Adjustments.

###### How To Stop A Loan Service Agreement


-----

Normally, a loan SA is automatically stopped when the bill segment for the last payment in the amortization schedule is
generated for the loan (refer to Finalizing And Closing A Loan).

If a customer decides to payoff a loan before the term is complete, you can:

- Transfer to the SA maintenance page for the loan service agreement, specify an End Date for the loan, and click Save.
This transitions the loan SA to pending stop.

**NOTE:**
**End Date. The loan SA cannot be stopped until the specified end date is reached, so do not specify an end date that is in**
the future unless you do not want to stop the loan until that date.

Once the loan is in pending stop and the end date has been reached, the system transitions the loan SA to stopped. On
the service agreement's normal bill cycle, the system final bills the SA for any outstanding balance plus accrued interest
charges.

If you want to stop the loan and create the final bill immediately, complete these additional steps:

- On the loan's SA maintenance page, click the Stop SA button to transition the loan SA to stopped.

- Manually, create a bill for the loan service agreement. Remember that if you only want to generate a bill segment for
a specific service agreement (e.g., the loan service agreement), transfer to the bill segment page. From there, you can
generate and freeze a bill segment for a specific service agreement. When finished, return to the bill page and complete
the bill.

When the customer pays the final bill, the loan SA is closed by the system.

**FASTPATH:**
For more information about SA states, refer to The Lifecycle Of A Service Agreement.

#### Non-Billed Budgets

A Non-Billed Budget (NBB) is a payment plan used to level out a customer's payments over time. Non-billed budgets are
typically used when your company bills on an infrequent basis and you want to provide your customers with a mechanism
to make smaller payments more frequently. For example:

- Rather than receive a bill once a quarter, a customer could set up an Non-Billed Budget to pay fortnightly

- Rather than pay two large bills a year, the customer could set up an Non-Billed Budget to pay 10 out of 12 months
(sparing themselves during the holiday season)

Non-Billed Budgets can cover one or more service agreements linked to the same account. You can have multiple active
Non-Billed Budgets for an account, but any given service agreement can only be covered by a single Non-Billed Budget at
any point in time.

**NOTE:**
**Non-Billed Budgets are optional. The business processes described in this section are only relevant if your**
organization offers Non-Billed Budgets to its customers.

**FASTPATH:**
For information about setting up non-billed budget functionality for your system, refer to Defining Non-Billed Budget
Options.

##### The Big Picture Of Non-Billed Budgets

The following topics provide background information about Non-Billed Budgets.

###### Non-Billed Budget Service Agreements

Non-Billed Budgets are initiated by creating a Non-Billed Budget service agreement for a customer. The Non-Billed Budget
SA and its SA type maintain the details of the Non-Billed Budget, such as recommendation rules, covered SAs, scheduled
payments and credit balance. Non-Billed Budgets are just like other service agreements in some ways:

- Non-Billed Budgets have a current and a payoff balance.

- If the customer doesn't pay a monitored Non-Billed Budget, credit & collections may start a collection process to
encourage the customer to pay (depending upon how the debt class has been set up on your system).

Non-Billed Budgets differ from other service agreements in the following ways:

- Non-Billed Budgets have a special role of Non-Billed Budget.

- Non-Billed Budgets have scheduled payments.

- Non-Billed Budgets maintain a list of covered SAs (utility and other service agreements to which the Non-Billed Budget
applies)

- Non-Billed Budgets are started and maintained on a separate transaction (refer to Non-Billed Budget - Main for more
information).

###### Which SAs Are Covered By A Non-Billed Budget?

A Non-Billed Budget can apply towards one or more of the account's billable SAs whose SA type is flagged as Eligible for
Non-Billed Budget. SAs can be added to or removed from a Non-Billed Budget at any time. Additionally, an SA can be
linked to more than one Non-Billed Budget as long as the Non-Billed Budgets to which it is linked do not have overlapping
start and end dates.

A list of the SAs covered by a non-billed budget is maintained with the Non-Billed Budget SA. This list is used at bill
completion to determine the financial transactions that should occur.

###### Non-Billed Budgets Versus Other Plans For Payment

Unlike a regular budget but like a payment plan, a Non-Billed Budget has one or more scheduled payments. However,
unlike payment plans, bills are not produced for the scheduled payment amounts. Instead, customers are simply notified of
the payment schedule and it is their responsibility to make the scheduled payments. In general, the following statements
highlight the differences between Non-Billed Budgets and other payment plans.

- There is a payment schedule that is not dependent on billing, unlike budget plans.

- Non-Billed Budgets are not limited to SAs of a single debt class, unlike pay plans.

- Debt is not transferred from regular SAs to the non-billed budgets, unlike payment arrangements.

**WARNING:**


-----

Non-Billed Budgets and Budget Plans! An SA should not be on a Non-Billed Budget if it is on a budget plan. A NonBilled Budget overrides any budget functionality in most cases. However, placing an SA that is on a budget on a
Non-Billed Budget may result in indeterminate results. For example, when the Non-Billed Budget is broken, the stop
algorithm for the Non-Billed Budget syncs current and payoff balances for those utility SAs that were covered by the
Non-Billed Budget.

###### There Are Two Types Of Non-Billed Budgets

There are two types of Non-Billed Budgets: monitored and unmonitored. As the terms suggest, the difference between
monitored and unmonitored Non-Billed Budgets is whether they are monitored by the account debt monitor. However, this
also means that monitored and unmonitored Non-Billed Budgets receive different financial treatment by the system.

In general, monitored Non-Billed Budgets have their current balances monitored by the account debt monitor while the
current balances of any covered SAs are zero (and therefore don't violate any debt collection criteria). With monitored
Non-Billed Budgets, customers make required prepayments that are applied towards their utility bills (until the Non-Billed
Budget is stopped). They are responsible for making sure the payments on their Non-Billed Budget are up to date, but they
do not have to payoff any balances on covered SAs.

Unmonitored Non-Billed Budgets do not have their current balances monitored by the account debt monitor while the
current balances of any covered SAs are maintained and therefore subject to the account debt monitor. When customers
are set up on an unmonitored Non-Billed Budget, the payments that they make towards the budget are optional. They are,
however, financially responsible for paying the current balances of any covered SAs.

**FASTPATH:**
Refer to Financial Transactions For Unmonitored Non-Billed Budgets for detailed information about the financial
differences between monitored and unmonitored Non-Billed Budgets.

**NOTE:**
**SA Type Determines Monitored Status. The SA type that you select when setting up a Non-Billed Budget determines**
whether it is monitored or unmonitored (i.e., it's a setting on the SA type). Your company may choose to implement only
monitored non-billed budgets, only unmonitored Non-Billed Budgets, or both.

###### Navigating To The Non-Billed Budget Maintenance Page

Any of the following methods can be used to navigate to the Non-billed Budget Maintenance transaction:

- An alert in the Alert Zone highlights if a Non-Billed Budget exists for the current account. You are transferred to the
non-billed budget transaction if you drill down on the alert.

- You can setup an order's campaign to automatically transfer a user to the Non-Billed Budget transaction whenever an
order is completed for a given SA. This might be useful for campaigns that are associated with services that are typically
on a Non-Billed Budget.

- A user can setup a favorite link associated with the Non-Billed Budget transaction.

- Via any of the following menus:

  - Account context menu

  - Service agreement context menu

  - Menu menu


-----

###### Recommending Scheduled Payments

When creating a Non-Billed Budget, you must select a recommendation rule. The recommendation rule establishes
the amount to be paid and the dates on which the payments are due. In other words, the recommendation rule creates a
recommended payment schedule.

The recommendation rules that you can use are specific to your implementation. The recommendation rule that you select
can have default values for its parameters. If your implementation allows, you can manually override one or more of these
default values. For example, you may be able to specify the period covered by the Non-Billed Budget and the day of the
month on which the payments are due.

If your implementation allows, you can manually modify the recommended payment schedule to suit the needs of a
particular customer.

**FASTPATH:**
Refer to Designing Recommendation Rules for more information.

##### Maintaining Non-Billed Budgets

Non-Billed Budget service agreements are started and maintained on a different transaction than other SAs. The topics in
this section explain how to start and maintain Non-Billed Budgets.

###### Non-Billed Budget - Main

The Main page contains basic information about the Non-Billed Budget. Open Menu > Customer Information > Non**Billed Budget > Search to maintain this information.**

**Description of Page**

**Non-Billed Budget SA (service agreement) information and SA ID are displayed on each page. These values only appear**
after the service agreement exists on the database. The SA ID is a system assigned random number that stays with a service
agreement for life. The Non-Billed Budget SA information is a concatenation of important details about the service
agreement and its account.

The Account ID is identification of the account that is financially responsible for the service agreement.

Indicate the CIS Division and SA Type. These fields control aspects of the service agreement's behavior, such as whether
the Non-Billed Budget is monitored or unmonitored. These fields are gray when the status is not Pending Start.

**NOTE:** If the service agreement’s account’s CIS Division’s Restrict to Account CIS Division flag sis set to Restricted,
the CIS Division is set to the account’s CIS Division and cannot be changed.

**FASTPATH:**
For more information about Non-Billed Budget SA types, refer to Defining Non-Billed Budget Options.

If Scheduled Payment Auto Pay is Included in Auto Pay and the account is set up for automatic payment, the scheduled
payments are covered by auto pay. If Excluded from Auto Pay, the scheduled payments are excluded from auto pay if it is
set up for the account.


-----

**Recommendation Rule is used to create a recommended payment amount and payment schedule. The SA type controls**
which recommendation rules are allowed for the Non-Billed Budget SA.

**Current Balance indicates the amount the customer currently owes on the Non-Billed Budget. If the Non-Billed Budget is**
unmonitored, the current balance is always zero.

**Payoff Balance displays the total amount the customer would owe if they wanted to close the service agreement. For Non-**
Billed Budgets, the payoff balance typically represents an accumulated credit that has not yet been distributed to the covered
SAs (at bill completion time or when the Non-Billed Budget is stopped).

The Start Date defines when the financial relationship begins. The End Date is a display only field that indicates when
the financial relationship terminates. The Expiration Date is the date on which the SA expires. The Renewal Date is the
date on which the SA is scheduled to be renewed by the SA renewal background process. If the SA is not renewed by the
expiration date, the stop process is initiated.

The Recommendation Rule Parameter Values grid specifies the parameters and their values to use for the selected
recommendation rule:

- **Parameter is the name of the parameter from the recommendation rule algorithm type.**

- **Value is the value used for the parameter. If the recommendation rule allows, you can override the default values by**
specifying your own.

**NOTE:**
The recommendation rule's payment schedule algorithm type (NBPS-MON) controls the number and type of
parameters. The recommendation rule controls the default values and whether they can be overridden.

The Covered Service Agreements grid lists the utility and other SAs that are on the Non-Billed Budget. You must create
the list of covered SAs before the recommendation rule can recommend a payment amount and list of scheduled payments.
The grid displays the SA ID, SA Information, Current Balance and Payoff Balance for covered SAs.

The scheduled payments grid displays the scheduled payments created by the recommendation rule (after you click the
Recommend NBB button). You can manually create or modify the Scheduled Date and or Scheduled Amount of any
scheduled payment in the list. The Total of Scheduled Payments shows the total of all scheduled payments in the list.

**FASTPATH:**
Refer to Scheduled And Actual Payments On The Non-Billed Budget for more information on what occurs when the
base Non-Billed Budget scheduled payment background process processes scheduled payments that are due.

In the Action grid:

- Click Recommend to create a recommended payment schedule based on the recommendation rule.

- Click Renew to manually renew the Non-Billed Budget. This executes the SA renewal algorithm for the SA type and
returns new renewal and expiration dates for the SA.

- Click Break to manually cancel the Non-Billed Budget. This executes the break Non-Billed Budget algorithm defined
for the SA type, and changes the status of the SA to pending stop.

###### Non-Billed Budget - History

The Financial History page displays the Non-Billed Budget's historical financial transactions. Open Menu > Customer
**Information > Non-Billed Budget > Search and navigate to the History page to view this information.**

**Description of Page**

**Non-Billed Budget SA (service agreement) information and SA ID are displayed on each page. These values only appear**
after the service agreement exists on the database. The SA ID is a system assigned random number that stays with a


-----

service agreement for life. The Non-Billed Budget SA information is a concatenation of important details about the service
agreement and its account.

The Account ID identifies who is financially responsible for the service agreement.

The grid shows the Non-Billed Budget's financial history in reverse chronological order, including:

- The Arrears Date is used to compute how many days old the debt is. For monitored Non-Billed Budgets, debt refers
to the scheduled payment amounts (i.e., the customer only owes the scheduled payment amounts up to the most recent
scheduled payment date). The arrears date for a schedule payment is the scheduled payment date.

- **Financial Transaction Type displays the type of financial transaction except for adjustments. For adjustments, the**
adjustment type's description is shown.

- **Current Amount is the effect of the FT on the service agreement's current balance.**

- **Current Balance is the amount owed by the customer at the time of the transaction.**

##### How To

The topics in this section describe how to perform common Non-Billed Budget functions.

###### How To Start A Non-Billed Budget Service Agreement

To set up a new Non-Billed Budget:

- Navigate to the Non-Billed Budget maintenance page.

- If the account is not already specified, select the Account for which you want to start the Non-Billed Budget.

- Define the CIS Division and SA Type to use for the Non-Billed Budget service agreement.

- If necessary, change the Start Date (the current date is defaulted).

- Select the Recommendation Rule to use and modify any of the default parameters to meet the needs of the customer.

- Verify the list of Covered Service Agreements. All the account's SAs that are eligible for Non-Billed Budget are listed.
Click to remove unwanted SAs from the list.

- Click Recommend.

- On the pop-up dialog, specify the Schedule Start Date and click Recommend.

- Make any necessary changes to the expiration date, renewal date and scheduled payments grid and click Save.

###### How To Cancel / Stop Non-Billed Budget SAs

To stop a Non-Billed Budget:

- Navigate to the Non-Billed Budget maintenance page.

- If the account with the Non-Billed Budget you want to stop is not specified, select the Account of the Non-Billed Budget
you want to stop.

- If the account has more than one Non-Billed Budget SA, select the Non-Billed Budget you want to stop.

- Click Break.


-----

###### How To Renew Non-Billed Budgets

Most Non-Billed Budgets are renewed automatically by a background process. However, you may manually renew NonBilled Budgets that are eligible for renewal if desired.

To renew a Non-Billed Budget:

- Navigate to the Non-Billed Budget maintenance page.

- If the account with the Non-Billed Budget you want to renew is not specified, select the account of the Non-Billed
Budget you want to renew.

- If the account has more than one Non-Billed Budget SA, select the Non-Billed Budget you want to renew.

- If desired, change the recommendation rule or any of the parameters.

- Click Renew.

The new expiration and renewal dates are calculated and the new payment schedule is appended to the list of scheduled
payments.

###### How To Set Up Automatic Payment For A Non-Billed Budget

If a customer wants to pay their non-billed budget scheduled payments automatically:

- Set up the account for automatic payment (as described under How To Set Up A Customer To Pay Automatically).

- Navigate to the Non-Billed Budget Maintenance page and select the Non-Billed Budget for the account.

- Set the Scheduled Payment Auto Pay field to indicate that the scheduled payments are Included in Auto Pay.

#### Case Management

**NOTE:**
**Separate module. The Case Management functionality is associated with a separate Case Management module. If**
this module is not applicable to your business you may turn it off. Refer to Turn Off A Function Module for more
information.

Your organization can use case management functionality to manage a variety of situations, such as:

- a high-bill complaint,

- a bankruptcy,

- an inspection of a premise,

- a customer's request for literature,

- a contractor's request to extend a line,

- a customer's rejection of a quote,

- a customer's request to change information on a future date,

- the processing of a market message in a deregulated environment


-----

**NOTE:**
**Your implementation controls how your cases behave. Since virtually all aspects of case management functionality**
are controlled by your implementation, you can use it to handle a myriad of business requirements. Refer to Defining
Case Management Options for the details.

##### Background Topics

The topics in this section provide background information about case management functionality.

###### Case Type

A case is controlled by the case type that it references. Some aspects of the case that are controlled by the case type include:

- The lifecycle of the case

- The applicability of a person, account, and/or premise on the case

- Which fields are required during the various stages of a case's life

- Which users can access cases of a given type

- Additional processing that should take place when a case enters or leaves a given state

Refer to Case Type Controls Everything for a description of the business rules that you control when you set up your case
types.

###### Creating Cases

To create a case, open the case management page in add mode, select the appropriate case type, fill in the other necessary
fields, and click save. Oracle Utilities Customer Care and Billing also includes scripts that can help create cases. Refer to
Scripts and Cases for more information.

You can also develop plug-ins and user exits to so that the system will create cases when specific events take place. For
example, you could set the system to create a case when an umbrella agreement is ready for renewal or when a quote is
created.

Please refer to Maintaining Cases for a detailed description of the case page and field descriptions.

###### Log Information

A case log contains an entry for every recorded event during the lifecycle of the case. There are two types of log entries:

- **Automatic entries. The system automatically creates an entry in the log when a case is created or there is a status**
change. Users cannot modify or delete these log entries.

- **Manual entries. Users can add manual entries to record significant events at their discretion.**

Refer to Case - Main for the page used to view the log.

Refer to Case Statistics for a Given Status for information about a report that uses the log to provide productivity statistics.


-----

###### Alerts

The alert zone will highlight if the person / account / premise in context have cases in a state that is configured as "alertable"
if you plug-in the appropriate algorithm on the installation record. Refer to Alert Info Is Controlled By An Installation PlugIn for the details.

###### To Do's and Cases

You can configure the system to inform users of cases that require their attention. Refer to To Do's and Cases for the details.

###### Reports

Several reports summarize case information. Refer to the Reports chapter for the details.

##### Maintaining Cases

Your organization can use the case management functionality to manage a variety of situations, such as:

- a high-bill complaint,

- a bankruptcy,

- an inspection of a premise,

- a customer's request for literature,

- a contractor's request to extend a line,

- a customer's rejection of a quote,

- a customer's request to change information on a future date,

- the processing of a market message in a deregulated environment

**NOTE:**
Since an implementation can configure virtually every aspect of a case, the look and feel of the case management page
are dynamic based on how case types have been configured.

###### Case - Main

Open the case management page by selecting Menu > Customer Information > Case > Search.

**Main Information**

**Case Info contains a concatenation of important information about the case. CaseID is the system-assigned unique**
identifier of the case. These values only appear after the case is added to the database.

**NOTE:**


-----

**Formatting may be performed by a plug-in. Refer to Case Info May Be Formatted By An Algorithm for more**
information.

**Case Type defines the type of case. This field is protected after the case has been added. Refer to Case Type Controls**
Everything for more information.

**NOTE:** Available case types can be restricted by CIS Division. The restriction of case type by CIS division is dynamic.
It is based on the account in context, the premise in context, or the current user. The restriction of case type is applied
using these rules in sequence.

  - If there is an account in context and that account has a CIS Division, that CIS Division is used to restrict the case
types that appear.

  - If there is a premise in context and that premise has a CIS Division, that CIS Division is used to restrict the case types
that appear. Note: If there are both an account and premise in context, the account CIS Division is used.

  - If there is no account or premise in context with a CIS Division and the current user is associated with CIS
Division(s) those CIS Division(s) are used to restrict the case types that appear. See Users and CIS Division for more
information.

**Status shows the current state of the case. Refer to Case Lifecycle for more information.**

If the case has any To Do entries associated with it, a hyperlink will appear summarizing the number and status of the
entries. You can select the link to view these entries. Refer to To Do's and Cases for more information.

**Date / Time Opened shows when the case was created. If the case is in a final state, the Date / Time Closed will also be**
shown. Refer to One Initial State and Multiple Final States for more information.

**Script references the business process assistant script that can help you work on the case. You can click on the hyperlink to**
execute this script. This field is hidden if no script is associated with this case's current Status. Refer to Scripts and Cases for
more information.

The Actions section contains buttons you can use to action the case. This area is suppressed if no actions can be performed
for the case given its current status. A button will be gray if you do not have security rights to the action. Refer to Buttons
Are Used To Transition A Case for more information.

When the user adds a new case or changes the state of a case manually the system attempts to auto-transition the case to
subsequent statuses as necessary. If auto-transition rules apply to the new state (and to subsequent ones) they would be
executed right away. If the case has been automatically transitioned to its current state the following message area appears
right after the action area. If an error is encountered in the process a corresponding error message is displayed in the Autotransition Message Area. Refer to Automatic Transition Rules for more information.

**NOTE:**
The Auto-transition Message Area only appears when a case has just been automatically transitioned to its current state
online. It only remains visible until the data for the case is refreshed.

Use the Comments area to describe anything interesting or unusual about the case.

**Person references the person associated with this case. This field is suppressed if the Case Type indicates that a person is**
not allowed on cases of this type. This field is protected if the case is closed (i.e., if its status is defined as being final). This
value is defaulted to the Person currently displayed in the Dashboard.

**Account references the account associated with this case. This field is suppressed if the Case Type indicates that an account**
is not allowed on cases of this type. This field is protected if the case is closed (i.e., if its status is defined as being final).
This value is defaulted to the Account currently displayed in the Dashboard.

**Premise references the premise associated with this case. This field is suppressed if the Case Type indicates that a premise**
is not allowed on cases of this type. This field is protected if the case is closed (i.e., if its status is defined as being final).
This value is defaulted to the Premise currently displayed in the Dashboard.


-----

**NOTE:**
The case type controls the relationship validation among person, account, and premise.

**Responsible User references the user who has overall responsibility for the case. This field is suppressed if the Case Type**
indicates that a responsible user is not allowed on cases of this type. This field is protected if the case is closed (i.e., if its
status is defined as being final).

The Contact Information area is used to define how to contact the individual who initiated the case. These fields are
suppressed if contact information is not allowed on cases of this type. The fields cannot be modified if the case is in a closed
status. The following information can be defined.

**Contact Person references the person who should be contacted. This defaults to the Person defined above.**

**Preferred Contact Method indicates how the person prefers to be contacted. The following options are available:**

- Not Applicable. If the person doesn't want to be contacted (or the contact method is unusual), use this option. You might
want to consider describing the situation in the Contact Instructions.

- Person Contact. If this method is selected, select a person contact related to the Person link to the customer contact. The
customer contact must contain a Person to use this method.

- Postal. If this method is selected, the Contact Person's address appears. Refer to Where Does The Address Come From
for a description of which address the system displays.

The following methods appear when the Legacy Person Phone and Email Option Type on the Customer Information
Options Feature Configuration has been enabled.

- Email. If this method is selected, the Contact Person's email address appears adjacent.

- Phone. If this method is selected, the Contact Person's phone number appears.

- Fax. If this method is selected, the Contact Person's fax number appears (the system knows which of a person's phone
numbers is a fax number by the phone type).

- SMS. If this method is selected, the Contact Person's short message service (SMS) information displays.

**NOTE:** While on a case, users can add a person contact by selecting Add Person Contact from a Person Context menu.
This will open a portal-based page that allows a person contact to be added. This process will not lose context or
information that has been added to the case. The new person contact can be used within the case.

Contact Instructions indicates any special instructions indicated for when or how to return a call.

Callback Phone Type, Callback Phone Number, and Extension indicate the actual phone number and phone type that should
be used to call.

**Characteristics**

The Characteristics grid contains fields that contain important information about the case. This grid is suppressed if the
Case Type does not use characteristics. This grid is protected if the case is closed (i.e., if its status is defined as being final).

You can only choose Characteristic Types defined as permissible for this case type. Refer toAdditional Information for
more information. If you attempt to use an Action to transition a case into a status that requires additional information,
a pop-up will prompt you for the additional fields. Refer to Required Fields Before A Case Enters A State for more
information.

###### Case - Log

To view the log entries associated with a case, open by selecting Menu > Customer Information > Case > Search and
navigate to the Log page.


-----

**Description of Page**

The Log grid displays log entries (in reverse chronological order) that audit the progress of the case. Please note the
following about the entries in this grid:

- The system automatically creates log entries when a case is created, every time its status changes, or whenever an error
occurs during the transition of a case. Algorithms plugged into a case type state can also be configured to create log
entries. You cannot modify or delete the log entries.

- You can manually add a log entry by pressing the + button and enter the Details. You cannot modify or delete this
information after saving it.

- The following information appears in the grid:

- **Log Date/Time contains the date and time the log entry was created.**

- **Details contains user-specified or system-generated information about the log entry.**

- **Related Object is populated on log entries that were created to record the creation of some other object. For example, if**
a case plug-in creates a customer contact, the related object contains information about the customer contact. Please note
that if the object description is shown in blue, you can click on the object's description to drill down to the object.

- **Log User contains the user who caused the log entry to be created.**

- **Log Type indicates how the log entry was created. The possible values are:**

- Created. Only one entry per case will be of this type. This entry is automatically created by the system when the case is
created.

- User Details. A user creates this type of entry manually.

- Status Transition. This type of entry is created by the system each time the case's status is changed (as a result of pressing
one of the Action buttons).

- System. An algorithm on the case type state may be designed/configured to create this type of entry when it does
something auditable. For example, an algorithm that creates a customer contact could insert a log entry to show that it did
this (it will also populate the FK to the customer contact, which will appear in the Related Object column).

- Transition Error. The background status transition process creates an entry of this type if an error occurs when
automatically updating a case to a subsequent status (as directed by either an Enter Status algorithm or an AutoTransition algorithm). An entry of this type lists the case states involved with the failed transition, and the algorithm in
which the error was generated.

- Exception. The background status transition process creates an entry of this type under the same circumstances as a
Transition Error. A log entry of this type indicates why the background transition failed.

**NOTE:**
The values for this field are customizable using the Lookup table. This field name is CASE_LOG_TYPE_FLG.

#### Premise Management

**NOTE:**
**Separate module. The Premise Management functionality is associated with a separate Premise Management module.**
If this module is not applicable to your business you may turn it off. Refer to Turn Off A Function Module for more
information.

The premise management functionality facilitates the following:

- Grouping premises together under a single parent premise


-----

- Quick & efficient setup and maintenance of apartment complexes and high-rises

- A single view of properties for a landlord, including service status

- Ability to change the landlord or service status for a group of premises in one transaction

- And more...

The topics in this section describe premise management functionality.

##### Overview

The topics in this section provide background information about premise management functionality.

###### Define Premise Hierarchy

Premise management allows you to define premise hierarchy. For example, you could also have the notion of

- A building

- Multiple floors

- Multiple apartments per floor

To define this hierarchy you must create a premise for each level in the hierarchy and for each "child" premise, indicate its
appropriate parent premise. Once you have set up your premise hierarchies, you may view the hierarchies on trees on the
premise page and on the control central premise tree.

In addition, the system provides the following alerts:

- When viewing a parent premise, an alert indicates how many child premises exist

- When viewing a child premise, an alert indicates that it is linked to a parent premise.

###### Manage Premises for a Landlord

The premise management page provides the ability to view all the premises for the landlord along with information about
the accounts linked to each premise.

You may use this page to assign, change or remove the landlord agreement for multiple premises in a single action. For
example if a landlord sells their properties to another person, this page facilitates updating all premises with one action
rather than changing the landlord for each premise separately. For example, if the landlord sells only a portion of their
properties.

This page may also be used to start or stop service for one or more premises for the landlord. For example, a landlord plans
to sell a high-rise apartment complex with 100 apartments. Imagine that 8 of these apartments are vacant and the landlord's
account is currently paying for any usage to these apartments. In addition to changing the landlord agreement for all 100
apartments to the new landlord, the service for the vacant apartments should be transferred to the new landlord. A user
can go to premise management, use the search criteria to view all premises for this landlord in a given apartment complex
whose service is currently being paid for by the landlord and start service for these premise for the new landlord. (Using the
back-to-back start/stop functionality, service will be stopped for the old landlord.)

###### Manage Groups of Premises


-----

The powerful search criteria on the premise management page allows you to view different groups of premises based on any
combination of account information, landlord information, parent premise address information and general geographic type
information. You may also define search criteria such as "premises not linked to account 1234567890" or "premises linked
to any landlord" or "premises not linked to any parent premise". For example, you could display all premises in a given
latitude / longitude that are not linked to any parent premise.

Once your search results display the desired list of premises, you could perform mass updates such as assigning a parent
premise or starting service. Following are examples of situations where this page would be helpful:

- The developer of a high-rise condominium complex is ready to start service for a group of condos. A user uses the
premise management search criteria to display the premises linked to a give parent premise (representing the condo
complex) that are not linked to any account. The user selects the premises in this list that the developer would like to start
and starts service for all premises at once.

- There is a shopping mall in your service territory and each store in an individual premise. You may decide to define
a parent premise for the entire shopping mall and link each store's premise to the parent. Once the parent premise is
defined, a user navigates to the premise management page and displays the individual premises based on a similar
address or based on a similar geographic type. The user then assigns the parent premise for all the individual premises
using a single action.

##### Premise Management Page

This page allows you to display a list of premises using a combination of search criteria. In addition, you can perform
actions on one or more of the resulting premises, including:

- Assigning a parent premise to one or more premises

- Removing the link to a parent premise from one or more premises

- Assigning a landlord to one or more premises

- Removing the link to a landlord from one or more premises

- Start service for one or more premises

- Stop service for one or more premises

Open this page using Menu > Customer Information > Premise Management.

**Description of Page**

The top half of the page is where you enter the criteria used to search for premises.

**NOTE:**
**Multiple search criteria may be specified. You can search for premises using a combination of search criteria. For**
example, if you enter both a Parent Premise Filter of Linked To Any Premise and an Account Filter of Not Linked to
Any Account; only those premises that have a parent premise but are not linked to an account will be displayed.

**At least one positive criterion is required. You may not define your search criteria to only use filter values that start**
with "Not Linked...". At least one "positive" filter value is required.

The following table describes each of the different search methods.

Search Method Description

Landlord Filter Use this filter to narrow down your search based on landlord. Enter one

of the following values:

Not Applicable


-----

Linked To This Landlord - for this option, you must enter a Landlord

Not Linked To Any Landlord.

A filter value of Not Applicable defaults.

Parent Premise Filter Use this filter to narrow down your search based on parent premise.

Enter one of the following values:

Not Applicable

Linked To This Parent Premise - for this option, you must enter a

**Premise ID for the parent premise**

Not Linked To This Parent Premise - for this option, you must enter a

**Premise ID for the parent premise**

Linked To Any Parent Premise

Not Linked To Any Parent Premise.

A filter value of Not Applicable defaults.

Account Filter Use this filter to narrow down your search based on account. Enter one

of the following values:

Not Applicable

Linked To This Account - for this option, you must enter an Account ID

Not Linked To This Account - for this option, you must enter an

**Account ID**

Linked To Any Account

A filter value of Not Applicable defaults.

Premise Filter Use this filter to narrow down your search based on account. Enter one

of the following values:

Located At This Address - for this option, you must enter address

constituents

Located At This Geographic Type / Value - for this option, you must

enter a Geo Type and Value

Not Applicable

Show This Specific Premise - for this option, you must enter a Premise

**ID**

A filter value of Not Applicable defaults.

The Select All / Clear All buttons are used to select premises if you plan on issuing any of the mass update actions at the
bottom of the page. Refer to the description of the "mass update" actions below for more information.

**NOTE:**
**50 premises at a time. Clicking Select All selects the first 50 premises in the grid. If more than 50 premises exist, you**
must select them in batches.

The grid that follows contains the premises that match your search criteria. The following information appears in the grid:


-----

- Select box. Use this checkbox to select premises for mass update actions.

- The Premise Information column shows information about each premise. Click the hyperlink to transfer to the Premise
page where you can update information about the premise in question.

- The Account Information column shows information about all accounts linked to the premise, if any. Only accounts
with non-canceled, non-closed service agreements linked to this premise are displayed. The column displays the name
of the customer's main person followed by a list of status values for any of the account's service agreements linked to
this premise. For example, you may see Customer A (pending stop), Customer B (pending start). If multiple service
agreements linked to the account & premise have the same status, the status is only displayed once.

- The Parent Premise Information column displays information about the premise's parent premise, if one exists.

- The Landlord Information column displays the landlord agreement description for the premise's landlord, if there is
one.

This transaction has sophisticated logic that can be used to perform "mass updates" to the premises that appear in the grid
using the buttons at the bottom of the page. The buttons are enabled if you select at least one row from the premise grid. The
following points describe these mass update actions:

###### Start Service

The Start Service button is used to start service for one or more premises. When clicked, the Start SA Groups
**Confirmation window opens.**

**NOTE:**
**Similar to Start/Stop. This page is similar to the Start SA Confirmation page that appears on start/stop. The differences**
are to accommodate starting multiple premises.

In order to start service for the selected premises, select the Account ID.

The Start Date is the date on which the service is scheduled to start.

Use Start Requested By to indicate the name of the person who requested the start.

Check Include Child Premises if all the child premises in the hierarchy below the selected premises should also be started
for this account.

Click Show SA Groups to populate the remainder of the page.

The Service Points section summarizes the service points that exist for all the chosen premises. A row is displayed for
each different SP Type along with a Count of the number of service points of that type. By default, all rows are checked,
assuming that you want to start service for all service points (and the SA Groups To Start scroll below displays proposed
SAs to start for each SP type). You may uncheck any SP Type row if you do not wish to start service for that SP type. Click
**Show SA Groups to rebuild the SA Groups To Start information.**

**WARNING:**
This page displays summary information about the service agreements and service points that are being turned on. It
is recommended that you start groups of premises that have similar service point configurations. If you attempt to start
service for many premises, each with different service point configurations, the start logic may be very complicated to
verify on this page.

The SA Groups To Start scroll contains an entry for every service agreement that will be created if you click the Start
button. If you do not want a service agreement to be created, click the - button or uncheck Start this SA Group. If you
would like to start service agreements that are not SP-based service agreements (for example a deposit or a connection
charge), click the + button to add a new SA group. The system assumes that you want to create a new service agreement for
each selected premise.


-----

Turn on the Start this SA Group switch if you want service agreements of this type to be created. If this is the first
customer at the selected premises, this switch is checked for all service agreements that appear in the scroll. For each
premise that was linked to a previous customer, this switch is on only for those types of service agreements used by the
previous customer(s). (We assume the new customers only want the services used by the previous customers). Service
agreements that are possible, but were not used by the previous customers, appear in the scroll with this switch turned off.

If Start This SA Group is checked, the system displays a message indicating the number of service agreements (for the
number of service points) that will be created if you choose Start.

For a description of the remaining fields, refer to Start/Stop - Start Confirmation.

Click Start. Standard start logic is followed when clicking start.

**NOTE:**
The start button is disabled if changes are made to fields on the page that may impact the SA Groups To Start collection.
You must click Show SA Groups to rebuild the SA groups and enable the start button.

###### Stop Service

The Stop Service button is used to stop service for one or more premises.

**NOTE:**
that this functionality stops service for any account linked to the selected premises. If you want to stop service at the
selected premises for only certain accounts, use the account filter criteria to narrow down the selection of premises prior
to clicking Stop Service.

When clicked, the Stop SA Group Confirmation window opens.

In order to stop service for the selected premises, enter a Stop Date.

Enter a Restrict to Account if you want to stop only service agreements linked to this account. If not specified, all active
services agreements for the premise are stopped regardless of the account.

Use Stop Requested By to indicate the name of the person who requested the stop.

Check Include Child Premises if the child premises in the hierarchy below the selected premises should also be stopped.

Click Show SA Groups to populate the remainder of the page.

The system builds a collection of service agreements currently linked to the service points for the selected premises. The
grid contains the CIS Division and SA Type for each SA "group" and displays the number of service agreements in the SA
**Group Summary.**

By default, the system checks each SA group assuming that you want to stop service for all SAs. You may uncheck any of
the SA groups to not stop service for those SAs.

Click Stop. Standard stop logic is followed when clicking stop.

**NOTE:**
The stop button is disabled if changes are made to fields on the page that may impact the SA collection. You must click
**Show SA Groups to rebuild the SA collection and enable the stop button.**

###### Assign Parent Premise


-----

The Assign Parent Premise button is used to assign a parent premise to one or more premises. When clicked, the Assign
**Parent Premise window opens.**

Specify the Parent Premise ID and click Assign.

###### Remove Parent Premise

The Remove Parent Premise button is used to remove the parent premise from one or more premises. When clicked, the
parent premise ID of all selected premises is reset.

###### Assign Landlord

The Assign Landlord button is used to assign a landlord to one or more premises. When clicked, the Assign Landlord
window opens.

Specify the Landlord agreement ID.

Check Include Child Premises if the child premises in the hierarchy below the selected premises should also be assigned
this landlord.

Click Assign.

###### Remove Landlord

The Remove Landlord button is used to remove the landlord agreement from one or more premises. When clicked, the
**Remove Landlord window opens.**

Check Include Child Premises if all the child premises in the hierarchy below the selected premises should also have their
landlord agreement removed.

Click Remove.

#### Umbrella Agreement Management

Your organization may use umbrella agreement functionality to manage many situations, including (but not limited to) the
following:

- Creating a "negotiated contract" with a large customer with many sites.

- Creating a "negotiated contract" with all customers in a common geographic area, for example a specific city or an
apartment complex

- Grouping and managing the proposal service agreements created during the quoting process

- Managing the renewal process for special contracts

- Applying override rate terms to one or more service agreements for a given effective period

- more...

**NOTE:**


-----

**Separate module. The umbrella agreement functionality is part of the Contract Management module. If this module is**
not applicable to your business you may turn it off. Refer to Turn Off A Function Module for more information.

##### Overview Of Umbrella Agreement & Terms Of Service

An umbrella agreement is used to group together terms for a contract. It contains high level information about the contract
such as the effective dates, the renewal date, if applicable and an account management group, if applicable. You may also
define characteristics and contacts for the umbrella agreement.

The terms of the umbrella agreement are defined using one or more terms of service (TOS) records. For each TOS record,
you must link one or more service agreements to indicate the services covered under the TOS.

The Terms of Service may point to a 'template service agreement' as a way to specify the rating terms and conditions to be
used by all service agreements linked to the TOS. If a TOS does not define a template SA, then the TOS is used largely as a
grouping mechanism rather than a billing mechanism.

Umbrella agreements and their terms of service records are used to support specific business scenarios that your
organization supports.

###### TOS Covered Entities

Your implementation may configure a Terms of Service type to require that entities "covered" by the terms of service record
be referenced on the TOS. For example, imagine that you define an umbrella agreement to provide special discounts to all
the McDonalds franchises in your service area. When creating the terms of service record for the umbrella agreement, you
may link the person record representing the McDonalds corporate entity as a covered entity for the TOS.

**NOTE:**
that there is no base product functionality that uses this collection. However, your implementation may use this
information in an algorithm, for example, it could be used in a campaign / package eligibility algorithm.

Refer to Terms Of Service Covered Entities for information about defining covered entities for a terms of service type.

###### Rate Terms Overridden By Terms Of Service


-----

Your organization may require rate information to be temporarily overridden for a service agreement that is linked to a
TOS. In order to do this, the TOS record must reference a template SA. Refer to Overriding Rate Terms for information
about defining your Terms of Service types to support template service agreements.

The topics in this section further describe the possible rate term overrides that may occur when a service agreement is linked
to a terms of service record.

###### Rate Schedule Override by TOS

If a service agreement is linked to a terms of service, you may configure the system to use the rate schedule from the terms
of service record's template SA rather than the one from the customer's service agreement. The customer's SA type controls
this option.

**FASTPATH:**
Refer to Configure SA Types for Umbrella Agreements for more information.

If a service agreement is linked to a terms of service record, the rate information tree on the service agreement's rate info tab
tells the user whether the rate from the service agreement or from the template SA on the TOS is currently applicable.

If a given service agreement's rate schedule is being taken from the terms of service record's template SA, then the override
rate schedule is used not just in bill calculations, but for any logic that requires the service agreement's rate schedule. For
example, one of the recommended budget amount algorithms may estimate consumption and apply the service agreement's
rate. In this case, the rate used by the algorithm is the one linked to the terms of service record's template SA.

###### Override Of Other Rate Terms By TOS

There are other terms associated with a rate that may change when linking a service agreement to a terms of service record
that has a template SA. These include contract riders, contract terms and tax exemptions.

When applying the rate to create the customer's bill segment, if a bill factor on any of the calculation rules indicates that it
is eligible for tax exemptions, contract terms or contract riders, a flag on the bill factor indicates where the system should
look for the appropriate value. The Terms of Service Usage flag tells the system to find applicable information either on the
TOS's template SA only, on the customer's SA only or it should first check the TOS, then check the customer's SA.

**FASTPATH:**
Refer to Configure Bill Factors for Umbrella Agreements for more information.

**NOTE:**
**Independent of rate source. The flag values on the bill factors are independent of the rate source setting for the SA**
type. For example, your implementation may configure the SA type's rate source to indicate that rate should be taken
from the TOS template SA. However, if a bill factor is eligible for tax exemptions, your implementation may configure
the bill factor to indicate that the exemption information should be taken from the customer's SA, not the template SA.

###### Umbrella Agreement Renewal

Although umbrella agreement records require an end date, your organization probably allows for renewal of agreements.
A renewal may involve full re-negotiation of all terms, or may be as simple as extending the current terms. If umbrella


-----

agreements of a given type are eligible to be renewed, you configure the UA type to indicate how to calculate the renewal
date and which algorithm to execute when the renewal date is reached.

###### Umbrella Agreement Renewal Background Process

The UA renewal background process (UARENEW) finds complete umbrella agreements whose renewal date has arrived
and executes the renewal algorithm for the associated UA type.

**NOTE:**
It is the responsibility of the renewal algorithm to update the renewal date as per the business practice. Refer to
Renewable Umbrella Agreements for more information.

##### Umbrella Agreements & Proposals

Umbrella agreements and their terms of service records may reference proposal service agreements. This functionality
allows you to create the full contract for your customer during the quoting stage.

##### Additional Umbrella Agreement Topics

The following topics describe additional functionality related to umbrella agreements.

###### Umbrella Agreement Alerts

The alert zone will highlight if any of the account's SAs are linked to an effective umbrella agreement (via a non-canceled
terms of service record).

###### Orders And Umbrella Agreements

When starting new service for a given account and premise, you may know ahead of time that the new service should
be linked to an existing umbrella agreement. For example, perhaps all the service in a specific low income housing area
qualifies for a special negotiated contract for the next year.

The system provides algorithms to allow you to add a new service agreement to an existing terms of service record when
using the Order transaction to start service.

Refer to Configure A Campaign To Link An SA To A Terms Of Service for more information.

###### Umbrella Agreement Reports

The system supplies a Report providing umbrella agreement information for one or more umbrella agreements.


-----

##### Umbrella Agreement Maintenance

Umbrella agreements help you manage your contracts by allowing you to group together service agreements for the contract
with one or more terms of service records for the umbrella agreement.

###### Lifecycle Of An Umbrella Agreement

The following diagram illustrates the lifecycle of an umbrella agreement.

Pending The umbrella agreement is created in pending status.

You may delete a pending umbrella agreement. Deleting a UA also deletes its terms of service records.

Complete Only complete umbrella agreements are considered effective. You may transition a UA to complete if there is at
least one terms of service record linked to it and if none of its TOS records are in pending status.

Under unusual circumstances, a complete umbrella agreement may be changed back to pending to correct errors.

#### Overdue Financial Obligations

The system periodically monitors how much your customers owe to ensure they haven't violated your overdue rules. When
a violation is detected, the system creates an overdue process. The overdue process contains the events meant to prod
the customer to pay (e.g., letters, disconnect field activities, To Do entries, write-off outstanding debt, etc.). This section
describes how to manage your overdue (i.e., collections) processing.

**NOTE:**
The overdue processing module has been designed to collect on virtually anything from an unpaid bill to an unmatched
financial transaction. You tell the system what you collect on by configuring the various overdue processing control
tables. In this release, the base-package is delivered with the algorithms that support collecting on overdue bills. If your
organization practices balance-forward accounting (i.e., collection is based on overdue service agreement balances), you
will not use this functionality. Rather, you will use the functionality described under Credit and Collections.

##### Overdue Processing Background Information

In the section, The Big Picture Of Overdue Processing, we describe how overdue processing works and how to set up the
control tables that automate most functions. You will find that many of your questions regarding when and how overdue
and cut processes are created and canceled are described in this section.

###### How To Perform Common Overdue Process Functions

The topics in this section describe how to perform common overdue process maintenance functions. Refer to The Big
Picture Of Overdue Processing for high-level information about overdue processing.

###### How To Create An Overdue Process

99.9% of all overdue processes are created by the Overdue Monitor and require no human intervention. The other 0.1% are
created by users on-line / real time. The following points describe how to create the 0.1%.

- Use Control Central to choose the account that requires a new overdue process.

- After the account is populated on Control Central, choose the Overdue Process + option on the account context menu to
transfer to the overdue process transaction in add mode for the account.

- After the Overdue Process - Main page appears, specify the appropriate Overdue Process Template. The template
is used to default the process's events (the template also controls numerous business rules, for example, when it will
be canceled, how it will be canceled, etc). Refer to How To Change Overdue Events for a description of how you can
override these events.

- Enter the overdue object(s) in the Collecting On grid. You must define at least one object.

- Save the overdue process.

###### How To Change Overdue Events

When an overdue process is first created, it has one or more overdue events. The events are the activities that will be
performed to persuade the customer to pay the outstanding debt.

The number and type of events that are created when an overdue process is initiated are defined on the overdue process's
overdue process template. The following points describe how to add / change / delete events on an overdue process if the
defaulted events are not satisfactory.

- Use Control Central to choose the account with the overdue process whose events need to be changed.

- After the account is populated on Control Central, choose the Overdue Process option on the account context menu to
transfer to the overdue process transaction in update mode for the account. Note, an account's Active overdue processes
can be selected from the Alerts zone.

- To add a new event, transfer to the Overdue Process - Events tab and press the + button in the Overdue Events scroll. At
this point, the event has not been added to the database; rather, it just exists in memory. Before you add the event to the
database, you must specify the following information:

  - Choose an Event Sequence so that the new event will be positioned properly in respect of the other events.

  - Choose a Status of Pending.

  - Choose the desired Overdue Event Type.

- If the activation of the new event is dependent on the successful completion of earlier events, turn on Dep on Other
**Event and then:**

  - specify the sequences of the dependent events in Event Dependencies and

  - specify the how many days after the completion of the last dependent event that the new event should be triggered.


-----

  - If the activation of the new event is NOT dependent on the successful completion of earlier events, turn off Dep on
**Other Event and use Trigger Date to define the date on which the event should be activated (i.e., completed).**

- To delete an existing event, click on the event in the tree on Overdue Process - Main. This will transfer you to the
**Events tab where you can click the - button to remove the event. At this point, the event has not been removed from the**
database; rather, it's been removed in memory.

- To change an existing event, click on the event in the tree on Overdue Process - Main. This will transfer you to the
**Events tab where you can make the desired changes.**

- After all desired changes have been made, save the overdue process.

###### How To Cancel An Overdue Process

The system will cancel an overdue process when the cancel criteria defined on the overdue process are satisfied. The
following points describe how to manually cancel an overdue process.

- Use Control Central to choose the account with the overdue process to be cancelled.

- After the account is populated on Control Central, choose the Overdue Process option on the account context menu to
transfer to the overdue process transaction in update mode for the account. A list of all overdue processes associated with
the account appears. If only one overdue process exists, it is automatically selected for you. Note, an account's Active
overdue processes can be selected from the Alerts zone.

- On the Main tab, click Cancel and answer any prompts.

##### Cut Process Maintenance

A cut process contains the activities to stop a service agreement (in the hopes that lack of service will inspire the customer
to pay). It should be noted that a separate cut process is created for each service agreement. The topics in this section
describe the pages on which cut processes are maintained.

**FASTPATH:**
Refer to The Big Picture Of Cut Processes for background information.

###### Cut Process - Main

**Overdue Process and Overdue Event define overdue event that created the process. Refer to Cut Processes Exist Under**
An Overdue Process for more information.

**Service Agreement identifies the service agreement being cut.**

**Premise identifies the service agreement's characteristic premise (if any).**

**NOTE:**
**Multiple cut processes may be linked to an overdue process / event. It's important to be aware that it's possible for**
multiple, active cut processes to be linked to the overdue event. You can see all cut processes associated with an overdue
process on the tree of Overdue Process - Main. The Alert zone will contain a summary of the account's cut processes.

**Status defines the state of the cut process. The following values may exist:**

- Active, Events Pending. Cut processes are initially created in this state. A cut process remains in this state until there are
no Pending or Waiting events.

- Inactive, Canceled by User. A cut process will exist in this state when it's been manually canceled by a user. Navigate to
the overdue process's Log tab to see when this happened and who did it.

- Inactive, Canceled by System. A cut process will exist in this state when it's been canceled by the system (typically
because the overdue obligations on the overdue process were satisfied). Navigate to the Log tab to see when this
happened.

- Inactive, Completed. A cut process will exist in this state when the system completes its last event. Navigate to the
overdue process's Log tab to see when this happened.

The Cancel button appears if the cut process is Active, Events Pending and the process's Cut Process Template has a
Cancel Logic plug-in. Click this button to cancel the process.

**Cut Process Template defines the template that was used to create the cut process's events. You can override these events**
on the Events page. This field is unprotected when the process is Active and all events are in either the Pending or Canceled
states.

**NOTE:**
**Changing the template. If you change the template, the system will delete the events and replace them with the new**
template's events.

**Start Date/Time defines the start date/time of the cut process. This field is protected after the cut process is saved on the**
database. This field is used to derive the trigger date of some cut events when the process is first created. If you need to
subsequently change the trigger date on the events, navigate to the Events tab and change the dates manually. Alternatively,
you can perform the following "trick":

- Change the Cut Process Template to something (anything). Doing this causes the Start Date/Time to become
unprotected.

- Specify the base date of the cut events in the newly unprotected Start Date/Time.


-----

- Change the Cut Process Template back to the desired value. When you change the template, the system removes the
events and creates new ones using the Start Date/Time.

**Inactive Date/Time is the date and time that the cut process became Inactive. This field is hidden if the process is Active.**
You can see more details about when and how the inactivation occurred by navigating to the overdue process's Log tab.

For example, if you enter 5, this event will be activated 5 days after all of the dependent events are completed /
cancelled. If you enter 0 (zero), this event will be activated immediately after the dependent events are completed /
cancelled. Refer to Calendar vs Work Days for a descriptions of how days are counted.

If all dependent events are already Completed or Canceled, you cannot specify Days After. Rather, you must enter the
desired activation date in the Trigger Date field.

- If Dependent on Other Events is turned off, enter the desired activation date in the Trigger Date field. If this field is
off, the Days After field and the Event Dependencies grid are hidden.

**NOTE:**
**If you can't wait for the Overdue / Cut Event Manager to run. The Overdue / Cut Event Manager is a background**
process that activates events on their trigger date. If you don't want to wait for this process to run, you can click the
**Trigger Events button on the Main tab to activate the process's events (that are ready for activation).**

###### How To Perform Common Cut Process Functions

The topics in this section describe how to perform common cut process maintenance functions. Refer to The Big Picture Of
Cut Processing for high-level information about cut processing.

###### How To Create A Cut Process

Cut processes are created when an overdue event is activated. You cannot create an ad hoc cut process.

###### How To Change Cut Events

When a cut process is first created, it has one or more cut events. The events are the activities that will be performed to
persuade the customer to pay the outstanding debt.

The number and type of events that are created when a cut process is initiated are defined on the cut process's cut process
template. The following points describe how to add / change / delete events on a cut process if the defaulted events are not
satisfactory.

- Use Control Central to choose the account with the cut process whose events need to be changed.

- After the account is populated on Control Central, choose the Cut Process option on the account or service agreement
context menus to transfer to the cut process transaction in update mode. Note, an account's Active cut processes can be
selected from the Credit and Collections zone.

- To add a new event, transfer to the Cut Process - Events tab and press the + button in the Cut Events scroll. At this
point, the event has not been added to the database; rather, it just exists in memory. Before you add the event to the
database, you must specify the following information:

  - Choose an Event Sequence so that the new event will be positioned properly in respect of the other events.

  - Choose a Status of Pending.

  - Choose the desired Cut Event Type.

- If the activation of the new event is dependent on the successful completion of earlier events, turn on Dep on Other
**Event and then:**

  - specify the sequences of the dependent events in Event Dependencies and

  - specify the how many days after the completion of the last dependent event that the new event should be triggered.

- If the activation of the new event is NOT dependent on the successful completion of earlier events, turn off Dep on
**Other Event and use Trigger Date to define the date on which the event should be activated (i.e., completed).**

- To delete an existing event, click on the event in the tree on Cut Process - Main. This will transfer you to the Events tab
where you can click the - button to remove the event. At this point, the event has not been removed from the database;
rather, it's been removed in memory.

- To change an existing event, click on the event in the tree on Cut Process - Main. This will transfer you to the Events tab
where you can make the desired changes.

- After all desired changes have been made, save the cut process.


-----

###### How To Cancel A Cut Process

The system will cancel a cut process when the cancel criteria defined on the overdue process are satisfied. The following
points describe how to manually cancel a cut process.

- Use Control Central to choose the account with the cut process to be cancelled.

- After the account is populated on Control Central, choose the Cut Process option on the account or service agreement
context menu to transfer to the cut process transaction in update mode for the account. A list of all cut processes
associated with the account appears. If only one cut process exists, it is automatically selected for you. Note, an account's
Active cut processes can be selected from the Credit and Collections zone.

- On the Main tab, click Cancel and answer any prompts.

##### Payment Arrangement for Bills

A payment arrangement is an agreement with a customer to payoff severely overdue debt in installments. Bills sent to
customers with payment arrangements contain charges for both their current services and their payment arrangement
installment amount.

Organizations that practice open-item accounting who collect on overdue bills may allow customers to pay off their overdue
bills in installments by setting up a payment arrangement for one or more bills. This transaction is used to maintain billoriented payment arrangements.

**FASTPATH:**
Refer to Bill-Oriented Payment Arrangements for background information.

Open this page using Menu > Credit & Collection > Payment Arrangement for Bills > Search page.

**Description of Page**

The SA (service agreement) Info is a concatenation of important details about the payment arrangement service agreement
(PA SA). The SAID is the unique identifier of the PA SA. These values only appear after the PA SA exists on the database.

The Current Balance that appears beneath SA Info contains the PA SA's current balance. When you initially set up a PA
SA this balance will be zero. It is only non-zero if the customer has not paid a billed installment.

**Payoff Balance beneath SA Info contains the PA SA's payoff balance. The payoff balance is the total amount to be paid off**
over the PA SA's life. It is only non-zero after delinquent funds have been transferred to the PA SA. This balance is only
displayed when it differs from the Current Balance.

**FASTPATH:**
Refer to Current Amount versus Payoff Amount for more information.

**Account ID is the account associated with the PA SA.**

The occurrences of Current and Payoff Balance beneath Account are the account's respective balances. These values
are displayed to help you confirm exactly how much the customer currently owes versus how much they will have to
payoff over time (remember, after you transfer funds to a payment arrangement, the amount transferred is reduced from the
account's current balance).

The Unpaid Bills grid contains a row for each of the account's unpaid bills.

Adjacent to each Unpaid Bill is its Unpaid Amount and a check box used to select the bill. Every selected bill's unpaid
amount will be transferred to the PA SA when you click the Create button.


-----

**WARNING:**
The system automatically indicates that all unpaid debt should be transferred to the payment arrangement. It does this by
checking each bill by default.

**Total Candidates is the sum of ALL unpaid bills (not just the selected bills).**

**New Payoff Balance contains the PA SA's payoff balance. This is the total amount of debt that will be paid off over the**
lifetime of the PA SA. This value equals the current payoff balance on the PA SA plus all selected debt from the Candidate
**SAs scroll.**

The next fields work in unison.

- If you want to define the number of future bills that the customer has to payoff the selected unpaid amount, enter the
number of Installments. When you tab out of the field, the system sets the Arrange Amount equal to New Payoff
**Balance / Installments.**

**NOTE:**
**Arrange Amount may not add up. The Arrange Amount is rounded up so that if you multiply the number of**
installments by the calculated installment amount, the result will be greater than the PA SA's payoff amount. Don't
worry - only the actual dollar amount of the PA SA's total debt will be billed by the system. The last installment will be
slightly lower than the other installments.

- If you want to define the amount charged on future bills to payoff the unpaid amount, enter the Arrange Amount. For
example, if the customer agrees to pay off their delinquent debt by paying an additional $50 on each bill, you'd enter
"50" in this field. Note - If you enter a dollar amount in this field and tab out, the system will calculate the number of
installments and display the number in the Installments field.

Define the CISDivision and SA Type of the payment arrangement service agreement.

**NOTE:**
**Payment arrangement SA types. There is a field on SA type called Special Role. Only those SA types with a role of**
Payment Arrangement may be selected.

Clicking the Create (or Change)button causes the system to perform the following:

- It creates / updates a payment arrangement service agreement (PA SA). It sets the installment amount on this service
agreement equal to the installment amount specified on the page.

- It transfers unpaid debt from the selected bills to the PA SA. The adjustment type used to transfer these funds is defined
on the PA SA's SA type.

- It links the "transfer from" adjustments to the unpaid financial transactions on the bills. This will cause the unpaid FT's
to be linked to Balanced match events. This means that any Active Overdue Processes for the bills should Inactivate (i.e.,
cancel) because the bills will no longer be consider unpaid. Refer to How Are Overdue Processes Cancelled for more
information..

- It reduces the current balance on the PA SA by the amount of debt transferred to the PA SA. Why? Because when
delinquent debt is transferred to the PA SA, its current balance increases. Because current balance contains the
amount the customer currently owes, this balance must be reduced because the customer is going to pay off the debt
in installments (and therefore they don't currently owe anything). The adjustment type used to transfer these funds is
defined on the PA SA's SA type.

Clicking Break causes the PA SA to become broken. Please refer to the note below for what transpires when a PA is
broken.

**NOTE:**
**Break logic is in a plug-in. Please be aware that the logic that is executed when a payment arrangement is broken**
exists in a plug-in algorithm (plugged-in on the account's Collection Class Overdue Rules). The base package algorithm


-----

performs many functions (refer to Breaking A Bill Oriented Payment Arrangement for the details). The bottom line is
that when a PA SA is broken, the originating bills will have their debt reinstated and this will again be subject to the
Overdue Monitor. Because this logic is in a plug-in, you can develop alternative logic and plug it in if the base package
logic is not satisfactory.

Clicking Cancel causes the PA SA to become canceled. Cancellation should be used when you want to "logically delete" a
PA SA because it shouldn't have been created.

The logic described above for breaking a payment arrangement is executed when a user cancels a payment arrangement; the
only difference is that the PA SA is marked with a different characteristic type / value than when it is broken.

###### How To Set Up A Payment Arrangement

To set up a new payment arrangement:

- Open Payment Arrangement for Bills in add mode.

- Select the Account in question.

- Select the debt to be transferred to the payment arrangement (by turning on/off the checkboxes adjacent to the Unpaid
**Bills).**

- Enter the number of Installments or the Arrange Amount.

- Define the CIS Division and SA Type of the new payment arrangement service agreement.

- Click the Create button.

###### How To Add Additional Debt To A Payment Arrangement

To transfer additional debt to an existing payment arrangement:

- Open Payment Arrangement for Bills in update mode.

- Select the existing payment arrangement in the search.

- Select the debt to be transferred to the payment arrangement (by turning on/off the checkboxes adjacent to the Unpaid
**Bills amounts).**

- Enter the number of Installments or the Arrange Amount.

- Click the Change button.

**NOTE:**
**After transfer. After transferring the funds to the payment arrangement service agreement, confirm the account's payoff**
and current balances make sense (the payoff balance is the total amount of debt that the account will eventually have to
payoff, the current balance is how much they currently owe. The account's payoff and current balances are displayed in
the page's second section. If you do not understand the difference between payoff balance and current balance, refer to
Current Amount versus Payoff Amount.

###### How To Break A Payment Arrangement


-----

You would break a payment arrangement when a customer doesn't make the agreed payments. Typically, your overdue
processes will break a payment arrangement behind-the-scenes if a customer doesn't pay. Refer to Breaking A Bill Oriented
Payment Arrangement for information about how the system monitors payment arrangements.

If you want to manually break a payment arrangement,

- Open Payment Arrangement for Bills in update mode.

- Select the existing payment arrangement in the search.

- Click the Break button.

###### How To Cancel A Payment Arrangement

You would cancel a payment arrangement if you made a mistake and never intended to set up the payment arrangement in
the first place. To cancel a payment arrangement

- Open Payment Arrangement for Bills in update mode.

- Select the existing payment arrangement in the search.

- Click the Cancel button.

##### Device Events

###### About Device Events

Device events are developments that have taken place relative to a device, and can include power outages, power
restorations, tampering alerts, command completions, among others.

Attributes used to define device events include the following:

- **Device Event Date/Time: the date and time of the event. This date/time is flexible in its interpretation. For single events**
it is the moment the event took place. For events that are paired, like a power up and a power down, it will represent
the start of the event when received with the first of the pair and the end of the event when received with the second of
the pair. For an event that includes the duration, where the device event end date/time is also supplied, this date/time
represents the start date/time.

- **Device Event End Date/Time: the end date and time of events with durations. This will only be populated if the device**
event date/time is also populated.

- In addition, device events also reference details specific to the head-end system that sent the event, including the
following:

- **Sender: the head-end system (defined as a service provider in Oracle Utilities Smart Grid Gateway) from which the**
event was sent.

- **External Sender ID: the external ID for the head-end system that sent the event.**

- **External Event Name: the external, head-end-specific name for the event. This name is translated into a "standard"**
event name within Oracle Utilities Smart Grid Gateway.

- **External Source Identifier: an identifier for the source of the event.**


-----

###### Standard Event Names

When the system is loading a device event, it first determines which head-end system sent it, and then determines which
device produced it. The system then maps the device event name sent by the head-end system to a standard event name that
corresponds to the event. Standard event names are beneficial because the event names sent by head-end systems vary, even
when the events are essentially the same. What one head-end system calls "Primary Power Down," another system may call
"Last Gasp." Creating a standard event name, such as "Power Outage - Device," makes it easier to send the device events to
an external system such as Oracle Utilities Network Management System. In this way, the external systems that receive the
events do not need to be configured to accept all of the possible names for a single type of event.

Refer to Understanding Device Event Types for additional information about how the device events are mapped using
standard event names.

###### Processing Device Events

Device Events received from external systems are processed through two major stages:

- **Device Event Seeder: This is the common interface point that receives all device event information and performs critical**
validations and conversions. During this process the device event seeder identifies the appropriate specific device event
business object for further processing. The choice is made based on the originating external system and the type of event
being received. For example, a device event for a "Last Gasp" would result in the paired event first device event being
selected.

- If for some reason the device event seeder encounters an error an instance of the device event eeder will be created to
manage the resolution of that error.

- **Specific Device Event: Each specific device event has the appropriate logic for the type of event that has been received.**
A tamper event might create a service issue monitor while a "Last Gasp" might create an outage activity.

###### Device Event Seeder Processing

The device event seeder receives device event data in a common structure, however, the content of the data (identifiers,
date/times, etc) can vary depending on the system and the particular device that generated it. To accurately translate the
external content to values understood by the system the device event seeder leverages the configuration of the service
provider (aka head end or external system) and the device.

The service provider specifies the following inputs into device event seeder processing:

- **Identifier Types: Each device event must identify the device the event has been generated from. The system supports a**
multitude of identifiers for the device. The service provider configuration specifies which identifier type is used for the
device which enables the device event seeder to search for the correct destination for the device event. For example, a
service provider might indicate that devices are identified by a serial number.

- **Date/Time Format: The service provider configuration will identify whether the date/times that were sent included**
specific time zone designations. This allows the system to accurately handle any time zone conversions that may be
necessary.

- **Processing Methods: A service provider has the following processing methods that are used in the evaluation of the**
device event:

- Device Event Mapping - Maps a given external device event name to a standard event name. That standard event name is
eventually used to identify the appropriate device event for specific processing.

- Time Zone Translation - Identifies the extendable lookup to be used in mapping the service provider specific time zone
to the interval time zone.

The device specifies the following inputs into IMD Seeder processing:


-----

- **Incoming Data Shift: This value is either specified directly on the device or can be defaulted via fallback on the device**
type. It identifies whether the incoming date/time information has is "Shifted" meaning it has been adjusted for Daylight
Savings Time (DST) when in effect, or it is "Not Shifted" which means it will never be adjusted for DST. This plays
an important role in the date/time processing since all incoming device event date/times will be stored without an
adjustment for DST.

With these inputs the device event seeder is able to translate the external identifiers into the appropriate identifiers to tie the
device event to the originating device in the system..

###### Device Event Seeder Critical Validations

For device events to continue on to specific device event processing they must pass the critical validations:

- The device must be identified.

- The device event must have an event date/time.

If either of the critical validations fails the device event processing will be halted and an instance of the device event seeder
will be created

Note: There is special logic that exists for handling the situation where either the device event date/time or the device event
end date/time falls on the duplicate hour that occurs when a time zone transitions out of daylight savings time.

###### Device Event Seeder Time Zone Translation and Conversion

To provide the most accurate tracking of device events all device event data is stored in a single time zone without
an adjustment for Daylight Savings Time (DST). As utilities can have multiple head end systems that each send date/
time information in different ways and some utilities operate in multiple time zones the device event seeder contains
functionality to convert incoming date/times from a source time zone into the time zone of Oracle Utilities Meter Data
Management (as indicated by the base time zone)

There are three components to identifying the source time zone of the incoming device event:

- **Service Provider IMD Import Date/Time Format: When the device event date/times are sent in a format that**
identifies the time zone for each date/time the date/times will be delivered to the device event seeder already converted.

- **Incoming Data Shift: This indicates whether the date/times will be adjusted for DST while it is in effect. A value of**
"Always in Local Time" indicates that the date/times are adjusted for DST. A value of "Always in Standard Time"
indicates that the date/times are not adjusted for DST

- **Time Zone: The time zone of the incoming data is identified using the follow order of precedence:**

**1. The time zone as indicated by the device event data**

**2. The service point time zone**

**3. The device configuration time zone**

**4. The base time zone**

Once the time zone and the data shift of the incoming date/times is identified all date/times will be converted from that time
zone and shift into the base time zone in standard time.

###### Specific Device Event Processing

 Types of Device Events

 Standard

Momentary device events, such as a tamper alert, are processed using the standard device event. These device events do not
provide any special processing.


-----

###### Paired Device Events

Device events with a duration are defined using paired event device events: paired event first and paired event last. With
the first of the pair representing the start of the event, and the last of the pair representing the end of the event. Events of
this type can be configured to create or complete activities that represent the event. For example, a "Last Gasp" event might
create an outage activity that is completed when "Power Restoration" event is received.

When pairs of events arrive in rapid succession (such as a last gasp followed quickly by a power restoration), these "paired
event" business objects are designed to prevent them from being sent to subscribing applications.

###### Communication Response

The communication response is a special type of event used for head end systems that respond to smart meter commands
with device events. When received these events create a communication in that will initiate the completion of the
originating smart meter command.

Refer to About Communication In for more information on a communication in.

###### Sending Device Events to Subscribing Systems

When device events are received, they are typically passed onto to another subscribing system, such as Oracle Utilities
Meter Data Management, a customer information system (such as Oracle Utilities Customer Care and Billing), an outage
system (such as Oracle Utilities Network Management System), or some other application.

The means of sending device event information to subscribing system is defined in the "How to Send Device Event Related
Information" processing method for the service provider representing the subscribing system. Device event information can
be sent via outbound communication business object, outbound communication, or batch process.

The method for sending device events to subscribing systems (business object, outbound message, or batch process) can
be defined for each device event category, and can be overridden for individual device event types (including the ability
to exclude specific device event types within a category. In addition, a default event processing method can be also be
configured that applies when methods of transmission aren't specified at the individual category level.

The "Subscribe to Device Event" business service is used to process device event subscription requests, and allow external
applications to manage the categories of events they receive.

Refer to About Device Event Notification Suppressions for more information on a suppression device event notifications.

###### Creating Service Issue Monitors and Service Investigative Orders

Device events can be configured to create service issue monitors and service investigative orders. The service issue monitor
type to create is defined on the device event type. When a device event is received, an Enter algorithm on the device event's
Processed state creates the service issue monitor, based on the Service Issue Monitor Type specified for the device event
type.

Refer to Understanding Service Task Types for more information on configuring service issue monitor types.

###### Device Event Prioritization

By default, device events are created and/or received into the system in an initial state is "Pending" and are transitioned to
subsequent states via the batch processing. This batch processing can be skipped by setting the Execution Method flag on
the device event to "Real Time" (D1RT), in which case an Enter algorithm transitions the device event to the next state in its
lifecycle immediately. This feature can be used to prioritize processing of certain types of device events.

The Execution Method flag can be set in in unsolicited device events sent from the head-end system, or can be inserted
during Oracle Utilities Smart Grid Gateway Adapter processing.

Oracle Utilities Smart Grid Gateway Adapters set this flag to "Real Time" on all device events created as the result of smart
meter commands.

###### Maintaining Activities

You use the Activity portal to view and maintain activities.

Refer to About Activities for additional functional information.

You can access the portal by selecting Main, Communication, Activity. You are brought to a query portal with options for
searching. Once your record has been selected you are brought to the maintenance portal to view and maintain the selected
record.


-----

**NOTE:** When creating new activities using this portal, if the Restrict Division setting in the Control by Division
section in the MDM Master Configuration is set to "Yes", only activity types with a Division (or Divisions) associated
with the user on the User Miscellaneous Information zone on the Miscellaneous tab of the User portal will be
available.

This portal includes the following zones:

- **Activity: defines the basic attributes of the activity**

- **Field Activity Attachments: lists attachments related to the activity (displayed only if the current activity is a field**
activity)

- **Activity Hierarchy: a tree that displays the activity and related activities (including field activities and smart meter**
commands), inbound and outbound communications, and completion events

- **Activity Related Completion Event: lists completion events (if any) related to the activity**

###### Manually Completing Service Order Field Activities

Service order field activities in the "Communication in Progress" state can be manually completed or canceled by clicking
**Complete in the Record Actions section of the Activity zone. This opens the Field Activity Manual Completion page**
where the user can enter appropriate details to manually complete the field activity (such as completion information, service
point information, device information, and so on). When submitted, this page creates an inbound communication and
transitions the field activity to the next state as appropriate.

Note: Implementations can define custom service scripts for each field task type in the Manual FA Completion
**Controls section on the Field Task Type extendable lookup to customize the sections displayed on the Field Activity**
**Manual Completion page.**

##### Communications

###### About Communication Out

These transactions are typically created from an activity and are tasked with sending a message to an external system. They
follow one of two communication patterns:

- Two-way: these messages are sent to the external system without an expectation of an immediate response, or a response
is received but it is only an acknowledgement of a successful receipt of the message. The true response to the message is
expected to be received in a process detached from the communication out. For the full lifecycle of the communication to
be complete a communication in must be received.

- One-way: these messages are sent to the external system and responded to in full within a single transaction. No
communication in will be received.

The format of the message sent to the external system is typically driven by a processing method for that external system
and the transportation method is controlled by the external system's message options.

If an error is encountered sending the message to the external system the communication out can perform automated retry of
the messages for a configurable rate of retry and number of retry attempts.

For one-way communications the communication out will be responsible for creating the completion event.

Once the message has been communicated and a response received the outbound communication will update the initiating
activity with the result.

**NOTE:**
Refer to the following topics for additional information on communications functionality:


-----

  - Understanding Processing Methods for additional information on how processing methods are configured.

  - See About Completion Events for details on completion events.

  - See External Systems in the Oracle Utilities Application Framework Administrative User Guide for additioal
information on configuring communication between your system and external systems.

###### About Communication In

These transactions represent a message sent from an external system and are received in two situations:

- In response to a communication that had been sent to the external system. This is the most common usage of the
communication in.

- An unsolicited message received from an external system such as a real time event. Note: this is not a common pattern.

- Upon receipt the communication in will link itself to the communication out that initiated it. The response message will
then be validated to ensure that it is technically and functionally correct.

- For many smart meter commands and field activities executed by service order management the communication in is
responsible for creating the appropriate completion events. For example, if the response was for the On Demand Read
smart meter command a completion event will be created that will generate the appropriate initial measurement data.

- Similar to the communication out a communication in that encounters an error can perform an automated retry with a
configurable rate of retry and number of retry attempts.

###### Maintaining Communications

The Communication portal is used to maintain communication in and communication out records.

Refer to About Communication Out and About Communication In for additional functional information.

You can access the portal from the Main > Communication > Communication. You are brought to a query portal with
options for searching. Once your record has been selected you are brought to the maintenance portal to view and maintain
the selected record.

This portal includes the following zones:

- **Communication: defines the basic attributes of the Communication**

- **Communication Hierarchy: a tree that displays the communication and related activities (including field activities and**
smart meter commands), inbound and outbound communications, and completion events.

##### Completion Events

###### About Completion Events

Completion events are used to implement the outcome of an activity. They are created by either the communication out (for
one-way communication) or the communication in (for two-way communication). Completion events are executed by the
activity orchestrating the communication with the external system.

Some examples of the tasks a completion event will perform are:

- Commissioning, decommissioning, connecting, disconnecting a smart meter

- Installing or Removing a meter or item


-----

- Creating initial measurement data

- Updating a device or service point

###### Maintaining Completion Events

The Completion Event portal is used to maintain completion events.

Refer to About Completion Events additional functional information.

options for searching. Once your record has been selected you are brought to the maintenance portal to view and maintain
the selected record.

This portal includes the following zones:

- **Completion Event: defines the basic attributes of the Completion Event**

- **Completion Event Related Objects: displays data related to the completion event such as a device, service point, or**
initial measurement.

##### Notification Suppressions

###### About Device Event Notification Suppressions

When a device event is processed by the system it can be sent to one or many external applications interested in being
notified about the event. A prime example of this is the Outage Management System subscribing to any device events
related to a meter either losing power or regaining power.

There are situations, such as a field worker performing maintenance on a meter or on a node that impacts many meters, that
will result in a large amount of device events being created, processed, and distributed to subscribers.

Device event notification suppressions provides a way for a subscribing system, in anticipation of scheduled maintenance,
to suppress notification of certain device events (power down, power up, tamper, etc) from one or more meters.

###### Maintaining Notification Suppressions

The Activity portal is used to maintain notification suppressions records.

Refer to About Device Event Notification Suppressions for additional functional information.

You can access the portal from the Main > Communication > Notification Suppression. You are brought to a query
portal with options for searching. Once your record has been selected you are brought to the maintenance portal to view and

#### Integrations


-----

##### Business Flags

###### About Business Flags

Business flags provide a view into the status of a service point across applications (e.g. Oracle Utilities Meter Data
Management, Oracle Utilities Analytics Insights, Oracle Utilities Customer Care and Billing). Business flags are currently
available in two forms:

- **Service Point Business Flags: are often informational in nature but also allow for manual investigation to be taken.**

- **Service Point Monitor Business Flags: are seen as symptomatic of an issue that needs to be investigated. These**
business flags feed into a service issue monitor and may result in a service investigative order being created.

For additional details see About Business Flags in the Oracle Utilities Application Framework Administrative User Guide.

###### Business Flag Allowed Actions

Allowed actions are implemented presented to the user as selectable options that will guide the user through a particular
method of investigating or resolving the business flag. The following actions are supported:

- **Create Field Activity: This will initiate a field activity associated to the business flag's service point. The type of field**
task will be selected by the user. Note: this option requires Oracle Utilities Service Order Management.

- **Request Customer Notification: This will initiate a message to the appropriate external system (e.g. Oracle Utilities**
Customer Care and Billing) that will identify a notification to be sent to the customer. The type of communication will be
determined by the notification type selected by the user.

Note: not all business flags support allowed actions and not all business flags that support allowed actions support all
allowed actions.

###### Maintaining Business Flags

Information for this functionality is available in the Business Flags section in the Oracle Utilities Application Framework
_Administrative User Guide._

##### Oracle Utilities Analytics Insights

###### Using the Meter Insights Investigation Viewer

The Meter Insights and Investigations functionality leverages the Oracle Utilities Analytics Insights business flag
integration to support receipt of revenue protection events (referred to as "insights") from Oracle Utilities Analytics
Insights for research and investigation using Oracle Utilities Meter Data Management (or Oracle Utilities Meter Solution
Cloud Service). Revenue protection insights sent from Oracle Utilities Analytics Insights for investigation are events
that suggest potential theft or loss of revenue such as unexpected consumption from an inactive meter, evidence of meter
tampering, discovery of an improperly installed meter (such as a meter installed upside down or in reverse), and so on.
Insights received from Oracle Utilities Analytics Insights create business flags, which in turn create related Meter Insight
Investigation service tasks (referred to as “investigations”). Business users can use the Meter Insights Investigations
**Viewer portal to search, view, and investigate these investigations. This portal is intended to provide as much investigative**
information as possible so as to allow the user to complete as much work as possible without leaving the portal.

#### Aggregations

##### Standard Aggregations

###### About Aggregations

Aggregations are measurements that represent a summarization of other measurements from a set of devices, items, and/or
measuring components. For example, an aggregation may be based on the sum of the electric consumption of all residential
customers in a particular postal code within the utility's service territory. The group of related measuring components for
which measurements are summarized are referred to as constituent measuring components.

Every type of aggregation has one or more dimensions. For example, an aggregation might be defined with three
dimensions as follows:

- Substation

- Feeder

- Transformer


-----

Aggregations are defined by aggregator measuring components. A separate aggregator measuring component should
be defined for every distinct combination of dimensions for a given type of aggregation. For example, the transformer
aggregation described above would require an aggregator measuring component for every distinct combination of
substation / feeder / transformer found among the electric Service Points.

Aggregations can also be aggregated. For example, the aggregator measuring components for each substation / feeder /
transformer combination can in turn be used to aggregate consumption at each substation / feeder combination. In this case,
a distinct aggregator measuring component would be defined for each unique substation / feeder combination. Likewise, the
aggregator measuring components for each substation / feeder combination could be used to aggregate consumption at each
substation, in which case, distinct aggregator measuring components would be defined for every unique substation. Finally,
the aggregator measuring components for each substation can be used to aggregate total consumption for all substations,
with an aggregator measuring component defined to represent the entire service area.

###### Aggregation Calculations

The system periodically aggregates consumption via batch process, using a deferred monitor on the aggregator measuring
components. In addition, users can re-aggregate data in real-time if they don't wish to wait for the batch process, or if the
original aggregation needs to be re-calculated due to incorrect data. Users can also create ad hoc aggregations "on the fly"
and these will persist in the database in the same manner as other aggregations.

###### Understanding Aggregation Periods

The start and end dates and times for aggregation calculations are based on the following:

- Aggregation Horizon

- Aggregation Lag

- Aggregation Cut Off Time

Whenever aggregation is performed for an aggregator measuring component, consumption is aggregated for every day in
its "Aggregation Horizon." The "Aggregation Horizon" is the number of days during which there's a potential change in
measurement data for one or more of the measuring components associated an aggregator measuring component.

Aggregation calculations typically lag behind the current date by a few days to give the system time to upload and perform
validations and create final measurements. The amount of lag time is referred to as the "Aggregation Lag" and is the number
of days between the date on which aggregation calculations are performed and the end date of the aggregation period. This
defines the time period between the aggregation calculation date and the end of the aggregation horizon that serves to allow
all measurements to arrive. This together with the Aggregation Horizon is used to determine the start and end dates of an
aggregation period. For example, with an Aggregation Horizon of 5 and an Aggregation Lag of 2, aggregation calculations
performed on January 9 would be for an aggregation period of January 3 through January 7. The next day (January 10), the
aggregation period would shift to January 4 through January 8.


-----

Aggregation is always performed through a given "through time" (such as 12:00 AM) rather than through the actual time
of the aggregation calculation. This time is referred to as the "Aggregation Cut Off Time." For example, the stop time for
aggregation calculations with an Aggregation Lag of 2, and an Aggregation Cut Off Time of 10:00 PM will always be 10:00
PM 2 days prior to the date on which the calculations are performed. In the above examples, aggregations performed on
January 9 would have an end date/time of 10:00 PM on January 7, and aggregations performed on January 10 would have
an end date/time of 10:00 PM on January 8.

###### Aggregation and Re-Aggregation

The use of the aggregation horizon means that aggregated totals for some days will be re- aggregated until those days are no
longer covered by the aggregation horizon. For example, with an aggregation horizon of 5 days and an aggregation lag of 2
days, on the night of January 9 the aggregation period would be January 3 through January 7 (as in the above example).

On the night of January 10, the horizon will shift 1 day (to January 4 through January 8, again as above). This means the
following:

- The totals for January 3 calculated on January 9 will be untouched (January 3 now falls outside the aggregation horizon)

- The totals for January 4 through January 7 will be re-derived because corrections may have occurred (and they still fall
within the aggregation horizon)

- The totals for January 8 will be calculated for the first time (because it now is within the aggregation horizon).

###### Manually Read Meters and Aggregation Lag

Aggregations that include manually read meters often have much longer aggregation lags than those for automatically read
meters. This allows more time for manual meter readings to be imported into the system for use in aggregations.

For example, suppose a situation where manual meter reads arrive approximately 1 month after the date of the reading.
In this case, it wouldn't be until a meter read upload on February 7 that the last manual reads including consumption
from January 6 will exist. Since we don't want to perform aggregations for January 6 until there's a decent chance that all
consumption for that date exists, an aggregation lag of 32 days ensures that the data for January 6 is in the system when the
aggregation is performed on February 7.


-----

###### When An Aggregator Measuring Component Contains Both Manual and AMI Measuring Components

The previous section suggests that if an aggregator measuring component contains both manually read and AMI measuring
components, the aggregator measuring component should have a long lag time rather than the short time shown in the
earlier example.

While this is one possible approach, an alternative approach could allow users to see timely aggregations of the AMI
channels and only lag the manual channels. To do this they could configure the system as follows:

- Create an aggregator measuring component that only aggregates manual measuring component types (horizon: 5 days,
lag: 31 days)

- Create a separate aggregator measuring component that only aggregates interval measuring component type: 5 days types
(horizon: 5 days, lag: 2 days)

- Create a third aggregator measuring component that aggregates the above aggregator measuring component types
(horizon: 5 days, lag 31 days)

###### Expanding The Aggregation Horizon Periodically

Even with a 30-ish day aggregation lag, it's possible for an account with several months of estimated consumption to have
its consumption "invalidated" when real readings arrive whose dial readings are less than the estimated readings (or when
major retroactive data change takes place). Another similar situation is when a user manually corrects consumption after the
aggregation horizon has moved forward.

To address situations like these, the use of ad-hoc aggregations with a user-specified aggregation horizon supports the
notion of periodically (such as once a month or once a week) aggregating with a long aggregation horizon (up to 90 days) to
catch as many retroactive changes as possible.

###### A Note About Using Non-Effective Dated Dimensions

Be aware that whenever aggregation takes place, the system uses master data that exists as of that date. For example, if
an aggregation is performed using non effective-dated master data attributes (for example, aggregating by measuring
component type) and a measuring component's type is changed, all days in the aggregation horizon will reflect the change
regardless of when the user makes the change, because the measuring component type relationship is not effective-dated.

The impact of this depends on the nature of the change:

- If the master data was wrong, this provides a way to re-aggregate the data to accurately reflect the master data.

- If the change occurred effective as of a given date (but there's no effective dated attribute), this can result in incorrect
aggregation values.


-----

Because of this, it is recommended that where possible dimensions used in aggregations be effective-dated.

For information on configuration, reference the related section for Aggregations in the Administration Guide.

###### Creating Aggregators

There are two ways in which aggregator measuring components are created:

- Automatically: The system will periodically create new aggregator measuring components when new "dimensional
values" are detected. For example, if a new substation is added to the system, a new aggregator measuring component
will be created for the substation.

- Manually: An end-user can create an aggregator measuring component at their discretion

###### Automatic Creation of Aggregator Measuring Components

The system automatically creates aggregator measuring components when it detects new instances of the dimension(s)
being aggregated. This activity is referred to as dimension scanning. For example, if the system is configured to aggregate
individual substations, a user will NOT have to manually set up an aggregator measuring component when a new substation
if referenced on a service point. Rather, the system will create the new aggregator when it detects a substation on a service
point that doesn't have an aggregator measuring component.

Similarly, if is configured to aggregate distinct combinations of rate class (on usage subscription type) and postal code (on
service point), the system will create an aggregator measuring component when it detects new combinations of rate class
and postal code.

The periodic monitoring to ensure sufficient aggregation measuring components exist is implemented via monitoring
algorithms on a related activity business object that references a corresponding measuring component type. This means
that there must be a separate activity type / activity combination for every type of aggregation performed. These monitor
algorithms include:

- A Monitor algorithm on the Active state that simply transitions the activity to the transitory Scan state. Users can
manually transition the activity to the Scan state by clicking the "Scan" button on the activity.

- An Enter algorithm on the Scan state finds the distinct combinations of dimensional values for this type of aggregation
and checks that an aggregator measuring component that references the activity's aggregator measuring component
type exists for every instance and creates new aggregator measuring components as appropriate. The algorithm also
populates the dimensional values on the new measuring components (mapped to searchable characteristics), and sets the
Consumption Aggregated Through Date/Time field on the new aggregator measuring components to the current date and
the Aggregation Cut Off Time on the aggregator measuring component type.

###### Hard-Wiring Service Types for Aggregations

If the dimensions used for aggregation do not include at least one service type-specific dimension (for example, in the case
of aggregating by postal code only) AND the aggregation should not commingle measurements of different service types,
it's important to:

- Declare the specific service type for the aggregation on the dimension scanner activity instance

- Declare the desired service type-specific measuring component types on the aggregator measuring component type

For example, if an electric and gas implementation aggregates consumption by postal code, they will need 2 activities:
one will reference the Electric service type and the desired aggregator measuring component type, the other will reference
the Gas service type and its aggregator measuring component type. The aggregator measuring components will have two
dimensional attributes: postal code and service type.


-----

###### Manual Creation Of Aggregator Measuring Components

Users can also create aggregator measuring component manually. This is useful when an ad hoc aggregation for an ad
hoc time period is required, or when there is no activity that automatically creates instances of a given combination of
dimensions. To do this, the user simply clicks the "Add" link on the Aggregator Search zone title bar. The BPA script:

- Prompts the user to define the type of aggregation (this will present a list of measuring component types whose
measuring component category is aggregator)

- Prompts the user to define the dimensional value(s), the desired aggregation time, and if this aggregation should be
performed indefinitely or if it is a "one time"

###### Base Product Aggregators

A number of standard aggregation processes are delivered as part of the base product. These provide a means of aggregating
measurement data by postal code and service type for both physical meters and items.

information of these functions refer to the Applying Measurement Functions section.

##### Dynamic Aggregation

###### Dynamic Aggregation Overview

Standard aggregation processing uses specific algorithms configured to work with a specified set of dimensions. For
example, the base package Service Type and Postal aggregation uses specific algorithms for dimension scanning and
finding constituent measuring components. In contrast, dynamic aggregation uses dynamic queries for the dimension
scanning, find constituents, and aggregation processes.

Dynamic aggregation can be used for analysis (to view aggregated data to understand load demand, for instance) as well as
settlement processing performed by Oracle Utilities Market Settlements Management.

Dynamic aggregation results can be viewed using Oracle Utilities Analytics Visualization. See Viewing Dynamic
[Aggregation Results Using Oracle Utilities Analytics Visualization and the Oracle Utilities Analytics Visualization User](https://docs.oracle.com/en/industries/utilities/analytics-visualization/)
[Guide for more information.](https://docs.oracle.com/en/industries/utilities/analytics-visualization/)

###### Understanding Dynamic Aggregation Execution

This section provides an overview of how dynamic aggregation processing is executed, including descriptions of the
different types of dynamic aggregation processing and the different types of data that can be aggregated.

###### Dynamic Aggregation Execution: Aggregation Groups and Aggregation Group Runs

Aggregation processing is managed via aggregation groups. Aggregation Groups outline the sequence of aggregations that
must occur for a given aggregation process. Each aggregation group includes a set of Measuring Component Sets, each of
which has one or more related Aggregation Measuring Components.


-----

When processing is initiated for an aggregation group, the system creates an Aggregation Group Run record to track the
status and progress of the aggregation processing. This record is used to manage the aggregation process for each group and
track which Measuring Component Sets should be executed next and when the aggregation is complete.

The following steps outlines the aggregation process:

**1. The Dimension Scan and Aggregation monitor batch control (D1-DSAEM) initiates processing for all Aggregation**
Groups. This should be scheduled at least once per day. This monitor process runs all monitor algorithms on each
aggregation group. The base package aggregation group has two monitor algorithms:

   - Aggregation Group Run Maintenance (D1-AGRM)

**2. The Aggregation Group Run Maintenance algorithm verifies if the Aggregation Group is ready to aggregate by looking**
at the processing timetable defined for the aggregation group and the last scheduled execution. If it is time for the next
aggregation then the algorithm creates a pending Aggregation Group Run which will then be used to track the status of
the Measuring Component Sets for the aggregation.

**3. At the completion of the Dimension Scanner and Aggregation monitor batch process, the Submit Dimension Scanner**
Batch (D1-SUBDIMSCN) post-processing algorithm searches for any Aggregation Group Run entries that are in
progress where the next Measuring Component Set is not manual. If at least one is found then it will initiate the
Aggregation Group Dimension Scanner batch process (D1-AGDS).

**4. The Aggregation Group Dimension Scanner batch process identifies the next Measuring Component Set for each**
Aggregation Group Run that is in progress. If that next Measuring Component Set is not manual then it will retrieve
each Aggregation Measuring Component for the Measuring Component Set and execute the monitor algorithms for
that Aggregation Measuring Component. These include an aggregation algorithm (specific to the type of data to be
aggregated such as interval, billed quantities, etc.) and in some cases a value derivation algorithm.

**5. For each Aggregation Measuring Component that is monitored by the Aggregation Group Dimension Scanner batch**
process, the aggregation process:

**a. Executes the appropriate Find Constituents algorithm to find the list of constituents that are to be aggregated**

**b. Extracts the data for those constituents that should be aggregated**

**c. Executes the appropriate aggregation algorithm against that data and store the results**

**d. Executes validation algorithms if applicable**

**e. Executes value derivation algorithms if applicable**

**6. The Aggregate Next Measuring Component Set (D1-AGGNXMCS) post-processing algorithm on the Aggregation**
Group Dimension Scanner batch process updates the Aggregation Group Run the batch information for each Measuring
Component Set that was aggregated, and requests the Dimension Scan and Aggregation monitor batch process to run
again.

**7. This again executes the monitor algorithms for all the Aggregation Groups which will do one of several things:**

   - If the Aggregation Group Run is in progress and the next Measuring Component Set is Automatic then nothing will
happen.

   - If the Aggregation Group Run is in progress and the next Measuring Component Set is Manual it will create a To Do.

   - If the Aggregation Group Run does not have a next Measuring Component Set, it will set the Aggregation Group
Run to Complete

**NOTE:** The Dimension Scanner algorithm will be executed again but since there will not be a pending Aggregation
Group Run it will not do anything.

**8. Once all Measuring Component Sets are complete the Aggregation Group Run Maintenance algorithm marks the**
Aggregation Group Run as complete.

###### Aggregation Scheduling

Refer to Understanding Aggregation Periods for basics about aggregation periods.

**Aggregation Scheduling for Aggregation Groups can be based on either a Defined Lag, or a Processing Timetable.**

- **Defined Lag scheduling uses the following parameters:**

  - **Aggregation Cut Off Time: The end time for aggregation calculations performed for Aggregation Measuring**
Components for Measuring Component Sets associated with the Aggregation Group. This is used to ensure a
consistent end time for aggregation periods. This is especially useful when aggregating other aggregations.

  - **Aggregation Lag: The number of days between the date on which aggregation calculations are performed and the**
end date of the aggregation period. This defines the time period between the aggregation calculation date and the
aggregation horizon that serves to allow all measurements to arrive. This together with the Aggregation Horizon is
used to determine the start and end dates of an aggregation period. For example, with an Aggregation Horizon of 5
and an Aggregation Lag of 2, aggregation calculations performed on January 9 would be for an aggregation period
of January 3 through January 7. The next day (January 10), the aggregation period would shift to January 4 through
January 8.

  - **Aggregation Horizon: The number of days in the aggregation period for Aggregation Measuring Components for**
Measuring Component Sets associated with the Aggregation Group. This reflects the time period during which there's
a potential change in measurement data for one or more of the measuring components associated with Aggregation
Measuring Components. This together with the Aggregation Lag is used to determine the start and end dates of an
aggregation period.

- **Processing Timetable scheduling uses a Processing Timetable Type to drive aggregation schedule.**

With dynamic aggregation, the aggregation period is consistent for all members of an Aggregation Group when an
aggregation is performed. This is despite the fact that there may be differences between Measuring Component Sets and
even Measuring Components within an Measuring Component Set as to how far the data has been aggregated through.
In addition, individual Aggregation Measuring Components all use the same aggregation period when aggregation is
performed.

###### Dynamic Aggregation Processing

This section provides additional details around the specific types of processing used with dynamic aggregation.

Similar to standard aggregation, dynamic aggregation processing comprises three primary types of processes:

- **Dimension Scanning: a process that searches for unique combinations of dimensions that are not yet represented by an**
Aggregation Measuring Component.

- **Find Constituents: a process that finds all source data to be aggregated for a given Aggregation Measuring Component,**
based on the Aggregation Measuring Component’s dimensions.

- **Aggregation: a process that aggregates source data that corresponds to the Aggregation Measuring Component’s**
dimensions.

Dynamic aggregation processing is driven by the following types of administrative data:

- **Data Sources define the source of data to be aggregated, such as measurement data from usage subscriptions linked to a**
service point, badged or unbadged items, or other sources of data.

- **Aggregation Measuring Component Types define the most important properties of aggregation measuring components**
used to store aggregated data.

- **Aggregation Groups define the ordering of a series of related aggregations and the schedule of aggregation.**

- **Measuring Component Sets define the dimensions and criteria by which aggregation will be performed.**

Refer to Dynamic Aggregation Configuration Overview for more information about configuration of this data.


-----

###### Dynamic SQL

Dynamic aggregation uses dynamic SQL queries to perform dimension scanning, find constituents, and aggregation
processing. These dynamic queries are based on configuration of:

- Data Sources

- Aggregation Measuring Component Types

- Measuring Component Sets

###### The Source of Dynamic SQL

Data sources provide template SQL that is used as the basis for dynamic queries. This template SQL is extended by
additional SQL generated from the data source configuration as well as configuration defined for measuring component
sets, measuring components, and measuring component types that reference the data source. The ways in which the
template SQL is extended is based on the type of process:

- **Dimension Scanning: The data source template SQL is extended by the criteria, dimensions, and individually managed**
items configured on the measuring component sets being processed.

- **Find Constituents: The data source template SQL is extended by attributes defined on the aggregation measuring**
components being processed.

- **Aggregation: The data source template SQL is extended by the value identifiers defined on the measuring component**
type of the aggregation measuring components being processed.

###### Dimension Scanning

The dimension scanning process analyzes master data to identify unique dimension combinations and create an aggregation
measuring component for each. Several objects play a role in this process:

- The Aggregation Group holds the monitor algorithm that performs the scanning

- The Data Source defines the template SQL for identifying dimensions

- Measuring Component Sets define the dimensions and criteria for identifying the dimension combinations

See Dynamic SQL for more about the role of data sources and measuring component sets in generating dynamic SQL
queries for dimension scanning.

This process is executed when aggregation is initiated for an Aggregation Group. This process should be run on a frequent
basis (daily or more frequent) and should be executed prior to aggregation processing being run. Each time it is executed the
dimension scanning process takes the following high level steps:

**1. Identifies all Measuring Component Sets for the Aggregation Group that are not imported from an external source**

**2. Identifies all yet to be represented dimension combinations**

**3. Creates an Aggregation Measuring Component based on the Measuring Component Set's Measuring Component Type**
for each dimension combination identified in step 2.

**4. Adds Attributes for each Aggregation Measuring Component created to describe the dimensions and criteria for that**
Measuring Component

**5. Adds an entry in the Measuring Component Set participants table for each Aggregation Measuring Component created**

This processing is performed by a monitor algorithm (Aggregation Group Dimension Scanner: D1-AGDS) on the Finalized
status of the Aggregation Group business object.


-----

###### Find Constituents

The Find Constituents process finds all source data to be aggregated for a given aggregation measuring component, based
on the Aggregation Measuring Component’s dimensions. The queries used for this process are based on data source
template SQL extended by attributes defined on the Aggregation Measuring Components being processed.

The Find Constituents process is initiated by the aggregation algorithm on the Aggregation Measuring Component (each
type of Aggregation Measuring Component — interval, item, billed quantities — has its own aggregation algorithm), and
is performed by algorithms defined for the Find Constituents system event on the Aggregation Measuring Component
business object.

This process differs slightly when finding constituents for interval and scalar measurements stored on measuring
components, item data, and billed quantities.

###### Measuring Components

The Find Constituents process for measuring components uses the Find Constituents for Dynamic Aggregation (D1FINDCONST) algorithm which retrieves data based on the following:

- Attributes on the Aggregation Measuring Component based on the Measuring Component Set configuration

- Measuring Component Types on the Data Source

Measuring component constituents are inserted into a global temporary table (GTT1) with the following information:

- Measuring Component ID

- Horizon Start Date/Time

- Horizon End Date/Time

- Time Zone

**NOTE:** The aggregation period for each is adjusted by the source Measuring Component’s installation history.

###### Items

The Find Constituents process for items uses the Find Constituents for Items (D1-FICONITEM) algorithm which retrieves
data based on the following:

- Attributes on the Measuring Component based on the Measuring Component Set configuration

- Item Types / Service Point Types on the Data Source (for badged vs. unbadged items, respectively)

Item constituents are inserted into a global temporary table (GTT3) with the following information:

- Maintenance Object (Device or Service Point)

- Device Type: Item Type

- Item Count

- Horizon Start Date/Time

- Horizon End Date/Time

- Time Zone

**NOTE:** The aggregation period for each is adjusted by the source Item’s installation history.


-----

###### Billed Quantities

The Find Constituents process for billed quantities uses the Find Constituents for Billing Data (D1-FINDCONSB) algorithm
which retrieves data based on the following:

- Attributes on the Aggregation Measuring Component based on the Measuring Component Set configuration

- Usage Subscription Types on the Data Source

Billed quantity constituents are inserted into a global temporary table (GTT5) with the following information:

- Usage Subscription ID

- Usage ID

- Horizon Start Date/Time

- Horizon End Date/Time

- Time Zone

**NOTE:** The aggregation period for each is adjusted by the source Usage Subscription’s installation history.

###### Aggregation Calculation

The aggregation calculations process aggregates source data that correspond to the Aggregation Measuring Component’s
dimensions. The queries used for this process are based on data source template SQL extended by the value identifiers
defined on the measuring component type of the Aggregation Measuring Components being processed.

The aggregation calculation process is initiated by Aggregation by MC Set Monitor batch process (D1-AMCS), and is
performed by monitor algorithms defined on the Active state of the Aggregation Measuring Component business object.
The algorithms used by each type of Aggregation Measuring Component are as follows:

**Aggregation Measuring Component Business Object** **Aggregation Algorithm**


Dynamic Aggregator - Billed Quantities (D1AggBilledServiceQuantities)


Aggregate Billed Service Quantities (D1_AGGBSQ)


Dynamic Aggregator - Composite (D1-AggregatorComposite) Aggregate Interval Measurements (D1_AGGINT)


Dynamic Aggregator - Customer Quantities (D1AggregatorCustomerQuantity)


Aggregate Customer Specific Quantities (D1_AGGCSQ)


Dynamic Aggregator - Interval (D1-AggregatorInterval) Aggregate Interval Measurements (D1_AGGINT)

Dynamic Aggregator - Items (D1-AggregatorItems) Aggregate Item Data (D1_AGGITEM)

Dynamic Aggregator - Scalar (D1-AggregatorScalar) Aggregate Scalar (D1_AGGSCLR)

See Types of Aggregation for more information about aggregation calculations for each type.

###### Other Calculations

In addition to basic aggregation processing, other calculations can be performed on aggregated measurements as needed.
For instance, a common step in aggregating date for use in market settlements is applying a loss factor to aggregated data to
reflect system losses (line loss, etc.) between generation-level quantities and end consumption quantities.

These types of calculations can be performed by value derivation algorithms. These are algorithms based on the Derive
Aggregated Quantity Using a Formula (D1-DERAGGQTY) algorithm type which apply a configured formula to aggregated
measurement values. For instance, to apply a loss factor, an algorithm can retrieve effective-dated factor values for a loss
factor and multiply each aggregated measurement value by the appropriate factor value.

The Execute Aggregation Value Derivation (D1-EAGGVALD) algorithm on Aggregation Measuring Components executes
any value derivation algorithms specified for Value Identifiers on the Aggregation Measuring Component Type.


-----

###### Foundation and Composite Aggregation

Dynamic aggregation supports two “levels” of aggregation. Aggregating source data, from measuring components, items,
or billed quantities is referred to as “Foundation” aggregation. Aggregation of aggregated data is known as “Composite”
aggregation. Composite aggregation provides the ability to aggregate data from a set of other aggregations.

The diagram below illustrates a simple example of the relationship between foundation and composite measuring
component sets. Each of the three foundation measuring component sets has a number of aggregation measuring component
participants that aggregate data based on a set of dimensions and a particular supplier and rate class. Those in turn are
participants in the composite measuring component set that aggregates based on the supplier (including data for all rate
classes).

A common scenario where composite aggregation would be used is to consolidate data across several foundation
aggregation measuring component sets that pulled data from a set of data sources ordered by precedence such that the best
data was sourced when available and when not the aggregations fell back to a lesser quality data source:

- Foundation: Interval measurements from usage subscriptions and / or service points

- Foundation: Scalar measurement from usage subscriptions and / or service points

- Foundation: Interval measurements from estimations (backcasted using actual weather)

- Composite: Aggregation by supplier

In this example the goal of the first aggregation would be to retrieve as much interval data as possible where that interval
data covered the entire period being settled for. The second aggregation would take scalar data for those instances where
interval data was not available and apply a profile to produce the appropriate intervals. The third aggregation would fill in
any remaining gaps that were not covered by interval or scalar data with estimations based various forecasting models.

At the completion of those first three aggregations there would be the full resolution of data for the customer base.
However, the values would be spread out across many aggregation measuring components tied to those measuring
component sets. This is where the composite aggregation functionality comes into play. The composite aggregation
measuring component would reference the first three foundation aggregations and sum together the data from each
aggregation into a single instance that represents the total usage for the period being settled.

Let’s look at a slightly more involved example. The diagram below illustrates a set of foundation aggregations based on:

- Rate Class

- Strata

- Procurement Class


-----

This shows how the physical measuring component data (designated by Customer A, Customer B, etc.) will be aggregated
into separate aggregation measuring components based on source of data (interval or scalar). Then it shows how those
aggregations are then aggregated to produce a total number that represents all 3 aggregation sources merged together.

###### Types of Aggregations

This section describes the processing used by different types of aggregations, including:

- Aggregating Measurement Data (Interval and Scalar)

- Aggregating Item Data

- Aggregating Billed Service Quantities

- Aggregating Aggregated Data (Composite Aggregation)


-----

###### Aggregating Measurement Data

Aggregating measurement data involves identifying constituent measuring components for an Aggregation Measuring
Component, identifying the measurement data that falls within the aggregation period, and aggregating that data. The
process varies slightly between interval and scalar measuring components.

###### Interval Measuring Components

Aggregation of interval measurements is handled by the Aggregate Interval Measurements (D1_AGGINT) algorithm. The
algorithm performs the following steps:

- It calls the Find Constituents for Dynamic Aggregation (D1-FINDCONST) algorithm and populates the GTT1 global
temporary table (see Find Constituents for more details about this process).

- It deletes any constituents from the GTT1 table that do not have 100% coverage for the dates in the aggregation period.

- For each remaining constituent in GTT1, the algorithm inserts its measurements for the aggregation period into the
GTT2 global temporary table. If the SPI and UOM are different from that of the Aggregation Measuring Component, the
measurements are converted to a common SPI using Axis Conversion.

- It performs aggregation calculations on the measurement data in the GTT2 table, using data source template SQL,
extended by the value identifiers defined on the measuring component type of the Aggregation Measuring Component.

- It either inserts or updates the results to the appropriate measurement table (the standard Measurement table, or the
Aggregation Measurement table)

- If there is no data for any dates in the aggregation period and previously aggregated measurements exist, those
measurements are deleted to indicate the absence of data.

- It updates the Most Recent Measurement Date/Time and Latest Measurement Date/Time values on the Aggregation
Measuring Component.

###### Scalar Measuring Components

Aggregation of scalar measurements is handled by the Aggregate Scalar Measurements (D1_AGGSCL) algorithm. The
algorithm performs the following steps:

- It calls the Find Constituents for Dynamic Aggregation (D1-FINDCONST) algorithm and populates the GTT1 global
temporary table (see Find Constituents for more details about this process).

- It deletes any constituents from the GTT1 table that do not have 100% coverage for the dates in the aggregation period.

- For each remaining constituent in GTT1, the algorithm inserts its measurements for the aggregation period into the GTT2
global temporary table. If the UOM is different from that of the Aggregation Measuring Component, the measurement is
converted to a common UOM before being inserted into GTT1.

- It performs aggregation calculations on the measurement data in the GTT2 table, using data source template SQL,
extended by the value identifiers defined on the measuring component type of the Aggregation Measuring Component.

- It applies a profile to the aggregated scalar values to create interval measurements with the same SPI as the Aggregation
Measuring Component.

- It either inserts or updates the results to the appropriate measurement table (the standard Measurement table, or the
Aggregation Measurement table)

- If there is no data for any dates in the aggregation period and previously aggregated measurements exist, those
measurements are deleted to indicate the absence of data.

- It updates the Most Recent Measurement Date/Time and Latest Measurement Date/Time values on the Aggregation
Measuring Component.


-----

###### Aggregating Item Data

Aggregating item data involves identifying constituent items for an Aggregation Measuring Component, calculate item
measurement data for the aggregation period, and aggregating that data.

Aggregation of interval measurements is handled by the Aggregate Item Data (D1_AGGITEM) algorithm. The algorithm
performs the following steps:

- It calls the Find Constituents for Items (D1-FICONITEM) algorithm and populates the GTT3 global temporary table
with groups of device types (for badged items) and/or service point types (for unbadged items) (see Find Constituents
for more details about this process).

- It deletes any constituents from the GTT3 table that do not have 100% coverage for the dates in the aggregation period.

- For each remaining constituent in GTT3, the algorithm calculates measurements for the aggregation period and inserts
them into the GTT4 global temporary table by applying the item counts for each group to the item interval (profile) data.
If the SPI and UOM are different from that of the Aggregation Measuring Component, the measurements are converted
to a common SPI using Axis Conversion.

- It performs aggregation calculations on the measurement data in the GTT4 table, using data source template SQL,
extended by the value identifiers defined on the measuring component type of the Aggregation Measuring Component.

- It either inserts or updates the results to the appropriate measurement table (the standard Measurement table, or the
Aggregation Measurement table)

- If there is no data for any dates in the aggregation period and previously aggregated measurements exist, those
measurements are deleted to indicate the absence of data.

- It updates the Most Recent Measurement Date/Time and Latest Measurement Date/Time values on the Aggregation
Measuring Component.

###### Aggregating Billed Quantities

Aggregating billed service quantities involves identifying constituent usage transactions for an Aggregation Measuring
Component, retrieving the service quantity data that falls within the aggregation period, and aggregating that data.

Aggregation of billed quantities is handled by the Aggregate Billed Service Quantities (D1_AGGBSQ) algorithm. The
algorithm performs the following steps:

- It calls the Find Constituents for Billing Data (D1-FINDCONSB) algorithm and populates the GTT5 global temporary
table (see Find Constituents for more details about this process).

- It deletes any constituents from the GTT5 table that do not have 100% coverage for the dates in the aggregation period.

- For each remaining constituent in GTT5, the algorithm retrieves billing data for the aggregation period (based on the
service quantity configuration on the data source) and inserts it into the GTT6 global temporary table. If the UOM is
different from that of the Aggregation Measuring Component, the service quantities are converted to a common UOM.

- It performs aggregation calculations on the measurement data in the GTT6 table, using data source template SQL,
extended by the value identifiers defined on the measuring component type of the Aggregation Measuring Component.

- It applies a profile to the aggregated values to create interval measurements with the same SPI as the Aggregation
Measuring Component.

- It either inserts or updates the results to the appropriate measurement table (the standard Measurement table, or the
Aggregation Measurement table)

- If there is no data for any dates in the aggregation period and previously aggregated measurements exist, those
measurements are deleted to indicate the absence of data.

- It updates the Most Recent Measurement Date/Time and Latest Measurement Date/Time values on the Aggregation
Measuring Component.


-----

###### Aggregating Aggregated Data

Aggregating aggregated data, also known as composite aggregation, involves identifying constituent aggregation measuring
components for a composite Aggregation Measuring Component, identifying the measurement data that falls within the
aggregation period, and aggregating that data.

Composite aggregation is very similar to aggregating interval measurement data, and uses the Aggregate Interval
Measurements (D1_AGGINT) Find Constituents for Dynamic Aggregation (D1-FINDCONST) algorithm.

###### Aggregation Measuring Components

 About Aggregation Measuring Components

Aggregation Measuring Components are measuring components used to store aggregated data. Aggregation measuring
components do not use initial measurements. Aggregated measurements are stored in the Measurement or Aggregation
Measurement table (based on the Measurement Business Object defined for the aggregation measuring component’s type).

Aggregation Measuring Components are defined by the following:

- **Initiating Measuring Component Set: The measuring component set that triggered creation of the aggregation**
measuring component via the Dimension Scanning process (see Dimension Scanning for more information).

- **Processing Information: Details of aggregation processing for the aggregation measuring component, including the date**
and time through which aggregation has been performed.

- **VEE Groups: The VEE groups used when performing validation, editing, and estimation for the aggregation measuring**
component.

- **Measuring Component Attributes: Attributes that describe the dimensions and criteria for the aggregation measuring**
component (identified by the Dimension Scanning process)

The base package includes the following aggregation measuring component business objects for use with dynamic
aggregation:

- Aggregator Interval (D1–AggregatorInterval): Used to aggregate interval measurements from interval measuring
components

- Aggregator Scalar (D1–AggregatorScalar): Used to aggregate scalar measurements from scalar measuring components

- Aggregator Items Measuring Component (D1–AggregatorItems): Used to aggregate item data

- Aggregator Billed Service Quantities (D1–AggBilledServiceQuantities): Used to aggregate billed service quantities from
usage transactions

- Aggregator Customer Quantities (D1–AggregatorCustomerQuantity): Used to aggregate specific types of customer
quantities such as Peak Load Contribution (PLC) and usage factors

- Aggregator Composite (D1–AggregatorComposite): Used to aggregate aggregated data from aggregation measuring
components (composite aggregation)

These business objects define the Find Constituents and Aggregation algorithms used for aggregation calculations.

#### Master Data Sync

The synchronization of master data into Oracle Utilities Meter Data Management is covered in detail in the Integrations
section of the Oracle Utilities Meter Solution Administrative User Guide.

#### Outage Storm Mode

##### About Outage Storm Mode

Unfortunately, utilities and their customers are often subject to natural disasters that cause disruptions to AMI networks.
These outage events can be related to hurricanes, tornadoes, ice storms, earthquakes, tsunamis, etc. During these severe
outages, AMI systems do not always provide outage and restoration events from the devices. Without these outage and
restoration events, Oracle Utilities Meter Data Management processes could estimate measurements that would be billed by
the CIS. This will lead to unhappy customers, potentially bad press, and lots of manual cleanup work after the fact.

While this is a problem for major outage events, this can also occur with smaller outages (smaller blackouts, planned
outages, etc.). This can potentially become an issue anytime the AMI network has a significant number of devices failing to
communicate.

This module includes outage processing to improve estimation accuracy during major outages. The system will
automatically stop estimations when the number of meter readings coming is less than a user defined tolerance. This
tolerance is based on a significant drop in the read percentage for all devices in a similar postal code, service type, and Head
End. Estimations will automatically resume when the device returns to normal operation. This can occur through a number


-----

of actions: read percentage for the surrounding area returns to normal, regular data is received from the device, or a power
restoration device event is received from the device.

Oracle Utilities Meter Data Management also includes the ability to manually override "storm mode". This override will
allow estimations to resume even if the outage hasn't been fully resolved. This will be useful if network fixes take too long
and the utility has decided that customers should be billed on an estimate after a few days pass.

**NOTE:** For information on configuration, reference the related section for Outage Storm Mode in the Administration
Guide.

The diagram below illustrates the primary flow for Outage Storm Mode processing. The steps include:

**1. The Dimension Scanner batch (D1-ADS) monitors the Meter Communication Tracking Dimension Scanner**
business object. New Aggregator Measuring Components will be created for every applicable Service Type, Postal
Code, and Head End in the system.

**2. The Aggregation Monitor batch (D2-AGG) runs to execute the logic for the Meter Communication Tracking**
**Aggregator Measuring Component. This logic will aggregate all meters for the defined Service Type, Postal Code,**
and Head End. Once the read percentage is found for that day then a measurement will be created for the Aggregator
Measuring Component.

**3. The Widespread Outage batch (D2-WSO) runs to determine if any of the "Meter Communication Tracking**
Aggregator" Measuring Components have dropped below the defined threshold on the MDM Master Configuration. If it
has dropped enough, then an Estimation Suppression Activity is created for each of the affected Service Points and the
"Meter Communication Tracking Aggregator" Measuring Component is set to an "Active Outage" indicator.

**4. If the Smart Meter Monitor batch (D1-SMMTR) runs to generate estimates while an Estimation Suppression Activity**
is active for a Service Point, then the Service Point will either be skipped for estimation or will have zero consumption
filled for all data with a condition code of "No Read - Outage Fill".

**5. There are a number of methods available to resume normal operation and close out the Estimation Suppression Activity.**
These include the following:

**a. The read percentage reaches a "normal level" again as defined in the MDM Master Configuration. This will be**
detected by the Widespread Outage batch (D2-WSO).

**b. When non-estimated data is received from a device, this will close out an open Estimation Suppression Activity.**

**c. If the Standard Event Name Extendable Lookup is configured with the End Estimation Suppression algorithm**
(D2-EN-ESTSUP), then any Power Up event this is configured for will close out an open Estimation Suppression
Activity.

**d. Estimation Suppression Activities can also be closed manually be a user by navigating to the Activity, using the**
"Edit" button", and add an End Date.

**6. The Estimation Suppression Monitor batch (D2-ESTSU) runs for all Estimation Suppression Activities to determine**
if the related "Meter Communication Tracking Aggregator" Measuring Component is no longer in a state of "Active
Outage". If the widespread outage has ended, then the Estimation Suppression activity will be set with an end date.

**7. The next time the Smart Meter Monitor batch (D1-SMMTR) runs it will generate estimated data as normally**
configured.


-----

In order to determine if an area is experiencing a widespread outage, the median read percentage of prior days is used as
the basis for comparison. The median was chosen instead of the average to help reduce the impact of outlier values. This is
illustrated in the example below.

##### Reviewing Widespread Outages

Anytime a Meter Communication Tracking Aggregator Measuring Component is marked with an indicator of "Active
Outage", a To Do will be generated for user review. The base To Do Type for this is "Widespread Outage" (D2-WSOTD).
This To Do is meant to serve as a warning to users that one of the areas in the service territory is experiencing a widespread
outage.

If there is a desire to continue processing as normal and not have estimation suppressed, then you can override the Meter
Communication Tracking Aggregator by hitting the "Force Complete Outage" button while reviewing the To Do. This will
mark the Widespread Outage Indicator as "User Override" and will allow estimation to continue normally.

###### IMD Processing Trend

The IMD Processing Trend zone displays the number of initial measurements and calculated numbers of constituent
measurements for each day in the selected time period. The x-axis displays individual dates during the selected period. The
left y-axis shows the average and maximum number of measurements per initial measurement. The right y-axis shows the
number of initial measurements. The graph shows the following:

- **IMD Records: The number of initial measurements processed on each day in the selected time period.**

- **Average Measurements: The average number of measurement values (for example, individual interval values) per**
initial measurement on each day in the selected time period. This is calculated by dividing the number of measurements
in all of the initial measurements on the day in question by the number of initial measurements on the day in question.
The number of measurements is based on the Start Date/Time, End Date/Time, and the interval size of each initial
measurement.

- **Maximum Measurements: The maximum number of measurement values (for example, individual interval values)**
per initial measurement on each day in the selected time period. This is calculated by dividing the largest number of
measurements in all of the initial measurements on the day in question by the number of initial measurements on the day
in question. The number of measurements is based on the Start Date/Time, End Date/Time, and the interval size of each
initial measurement.

You can filter the data displayed using the following controls:

- **Period View: Specifies he range of data displayed. Options include Thirty Days, Seven Days, Three Days, or One Day.**
The default is "Seven Days".

- **Interval/Scalar: Specifies whether the graph should display only interval initial measurements, scalar initial**
measurements, or both. The default is "Show All".

- **Business Object: Specifies the initial measurement business object(s) related to the initial measurements displayed in the**
graph. The default is "Show All".

- **Status: Specifies the status (Pending, VEE Ready, Exception, Error, Finalized, and so on) of the initial measurements**
displayed in the graph. The default is "Show All".

- **Data Source: Specifies the data source (if any) of the initial measurements displayed in the graph. The default is "Show**
All".

###### IMD Quality Trend

The IMD Quality Trend zone displays the number of Validation, Editing, and Estimation (VEE) exceptions and calculated
numbers of measurements for each day in the selected time period. The x-axis displays individual dates during the selected
period. The left y-axis shows the average and maximum number of measurements per initial measurement. The right y-axis
shows the number of VEE exceptions. The graph shows the following:

- **VEE Exceptions: The number of VEE exceptions processed on each day in the selected time period.**

- **Average Measurements: The average number of measurement values (for example, individual interval values) per**
initial measurement on each day in the selected time period. This is calculated by dividing the number of measurements
in all of the initial measurements on the day in question by the number of initial measurements on the day in question.
The number of measurements is based on the Start Date/Time, End Date/Time, and the interval size of each initial
measurement.

- **Maximum Measurements: The maximum number of measurement values (for example, individual interval values)**
per initial measurement on each day in the selected time period. This is calculated by dividing the largest number of
measurements in all of the initial measurements on the day in question by the number of initial measurements on the day
in question. The number of measurements is based on the Start Date/Time, End Date/Time, and the interval size of each
initial measurement.

You can filter the data displayed using the following controls:

- **Period View: Specifies he range of data displayed. Options include Thirty Days, Seven Days, Three Days, or One Day.**
The default is "Seven Days".

- **Interval/Scalar: Specifies whether the graph should display data for only interval initial measurements, scalar initial**
measurements, or both. The default is "Show All".

- **Business Object: Specifies the initial measurement business object(s) related to the data displayed in the graph. The**

#### Totals and Trends

##### Processing Statistics

###### About Processing Statistics

Upload statistics (or upload stats) are statistics related to the uploading of initial measurement data and device events sent
from a head-end system.

Upload statistics are defined as activities in Oracle Utilities Smart Grid Gateway.

There are three types of upload statistics activities:

**Payload Statistics: Contains statistics related to a specific payload (file) containing one or more initial measurements or**
device events. Payload Statistics activities contain:

- Basic information about the payload (head-end system, file name, and status

- Middleware statistics including specifics about the file, the total number of initial measurements or device events
processed, the number of initial measurement or device events errors, and total processing time

- Initial measurement statistics including the number of initial measurements processed

- Device event statistics including the number of device events processed

**Payload Error Notification: Contains details concerning processing errors encountered in an individual payload (file)**
containing one or more initial measurements or device events. Payload Error Notification activities are related to Payload
Statistics activities.


-----

**Payload Summary: Contains processing summary statistics for an individual payload (file) containing one or more initial**
measurements or device events. Payload Summary activities are related to Payload Statistics activities, and are used to
update related payload statistics upon the completion of payload processing.

Upload statistics activities are created during processing of payload files as follows:

- When processing begins for a payload, a Payload Statistics activity is created to record the process.

- If an error occurs during processing, a Payload Error Notification activity is created.

- When payload processing is complete, a Payload Summary activity is created, which in turn, updates the Payload
Statistics activity with details concerning the processing of the payload, including (the start and end time of the
processing, the total processing time, the number of initial measurements or device events processed, and the number of
initial measurement or device event errors (if any).

###### About Head-End System Processing Statistics

Head-end system processing statistics are summarized processing statistics for payloads received from a given head-end
system.

As Oracle Utilities Smart Grid Gateway processes payloads containing initial measurements or device events, statistics
for each payload are captured in Payload Statistics activities. Over time, payload statistics for each head-end system are
summarized to allow administrators to view statistics summary for the head-end system.

Head-end system processing statistics are stored as aggregated measurements for aggregator measuring components. A
separate aggregator measuring component must be set up for each head-end system for which processing statistics will be
aggregated.

##### Consumption Statistics

Please refer to the About Aggregation section for information on consumption statistics.

#### Time Zone Support

##### Daylight Savings Time Support

This section describes how the Oracle Utilities Service and Measurement Data Foundation and its related products support
Daylight Saving Time (DST).

All date/times in the system are displayed adjusted for daylight savings time (when in effect). However, not all date/times in
the system are stored in daylight savings time:

- Stored in Standard (not adjusted for DST): data that is highly sensitive to DST shifts are stored in standard time without
any shifts, this means they have a consistent 24 hour day each day all year and avoid issues that arise from a skipped
hour when transitioning to DST and a duplicate hour when transitioning out of DST. For example: initial measurement
data, final measurements, device events, TOU map data.

- These date/times are adjusted for daylight savings time prior to being displayed to a user.

- Stored in Legal (adjusted for DST): data that is not as sensitive to DST time shifts are stored in legal time. For example,
device configurations, service points, installation events, usage subscriptions, usage transactions.


-----

###### Adjusting Date/times Upon Receipt

The two largest sources of imported data to the system can be sent in a mixture of date/time formats some in legal time
some in standard time:

- Initial Measurement Data

- Device Events

Since both sets of data are sent by head end systems and each head end system handles date/times differently, potentially
even differing by device, the interface must be extremely flexible in how it handles date/times. In order to ensure data is
accurately stored and processed the system must know how a given meter sends date/time information. This is defined on
the device through the Incoming Data Shift field:

- Always in Standard Time: No special handling is required.

- Always in Legal Time: All date/times for the initial measurement data or device event will be converted from legal time
into standard time.

- In circumstances where a date/time is received in legal time and it falls on the duplicate hour that occurs when DST ends
special logic will be executed to identify whether that hour is the first (still in DST) or second (no longer in DST) of the
duplicate hours. If for some reason it cannot be identified which hour it is the transaction will go into error.

###### Daylight Savings Time Interval Conversion Examples

The following examples show how data received legal time will be shifted into standard time for an interval meter that is
read on an hourly basis.

###### Daylight Savings Impact on Periodic Estimation

In periodic estimation both the interval and scalar versions can be impacted by daylight savings time:

- Interval periodic estimation using the "Predictable Cut-off" method.

- All scalar periodic estimation

Refer to About Periodic Estimation for more information about the impact of Daylight Savings Time on periodic estimation.

##### Multiple Time Zone Support

Some utilities have operations in more than a single time zone. When operating in multiple time zones, Oracle Utilities
Meter Data Management and Smart Grid Gateway provide the following high level functionality:

- The ability to receive data in any time zone and convert it to the common time zone used by Oracle Utilities Meter Data
Management (as defined by the base time zone)

- The ability to display functional date/times in the time zone of a given device, service point, usage subscription

- The ability to define what time zone a measuring component, device configuration, service point, or usage subscription
resides in

- The ability to aggregate data across time zones into a single time zone or without respect to a time zone (see
Aggregations on page E-17 for more information).

- The ability to export data to an external system with the appropriate time zone information to enable the external system
to consume data from different service points in different time zones

By default, the system assumes only a single time zone is supported. To enable support for multiple time zones it requires
that adding the appropriate entry to the general system configuration feature configuration.

Refer to Configuring Feature Configurations for additional on the feature configuration options available.


-----

###### Date/Time Storage and Display

All date/times in the system are stored in the base time zone. Date/times are stored in either standard time or legal time and
this determination is made based on the type of data (e.g. measurements are in standard but installation event date/times are
in legal).

All date/times are displayed in legal time. Those date/times that are key functional date/times related to a device, service
point, or usage subscription will be displayed in the legal time of the time zone the device resides in.

Refer to the Glossary of Terms for a more detailed definition of Standard and Legal time.

###### Time Zone Hierarchy and Maintenance

A time zone can be defined at many points within the device to usage subscription hierarchy. This enables the time zone to
be accurately portrayed based on the installation status of that device (e.g. not installed, installed but not billed, billed). At
each stage of the hierarchy the time zones must match.

Once the hierarchy has been established no one portion of that hierarchy can be changed to a time zone that differs from the
other levels of the hierarchy. In order to change the time zone for an established device to usage subscription hierarchy the
change must be done to the service point. Once the service point time zone has been changed the system will cascade that
change to all other levels of the hierarchy.

If a device has been installed at a service point in order for it to be moved to a different service point in a different time
zone. It will require that a new device configuration be created for time zone of the new service point since a device
configuration cannot be associated to two different service points each with a different time zone from the device
configuration.

Note: If the time zone for a device that has existing measurements has been changed there will be no automatic adjustments
made to the underlying measurement data. If the measurement data must be changed it will require manual intervention.

Note: Although measuring component has time zone it is not populated on physical devices that are installed at service
points. This time zone is used for standalone measuring components.


-----

###### Impacts on Aggregations

In aggregation there are two use cases for how data should be aggregated for service points that exist in differing time
zones:

- **Absolute Time: If a time zone is provided on the measuring component or measuring component type, then the**
aggregation horizon date/times will be used across service points of differing time zones. For example the 4/1/2010
12AM interval in US/Pacific would be combined with the 4/1/2010 3AM interval in US/Eastern. Since all date/times are
stored in the base time zone there is no need to do time zone conversions.

- **Local Time: If no time zone is specified, consumption is aggregated by converting the aggregation horizon to the**
appropriate time zone for each service point. For example the 4/1/2010 12AM interval in US/Pacific would be combined
with the 4/1/2010 12AM interval in US/Eastern.

Aggregation Measuring Components in general do not have any time zone related dependencies with other master
configuration objects. However, when an aggregator is listed as a direct channel measuring component on a usage
subscription it share the same time zone as the Usage Subscription.

###### Impacts on TOU Map Generation

The date and times defined on a Time of Use Mapping Templates (TOU) do not have a time zone associated to them and
will be interpreted based on the time zone of the TOU map type of the specific TOU Map being processed. This allows for a
single definition of a TOU schedule that can be applied across many different time zones.

During the generation of the TOU map data for a given TOU map template the date/times will be converted from the time
zone of the TOU map to the time zone defined in the base time zone defined on the installation options - framework. For
example, if 1/1/2010 5:00PM was considered to be "On Peak" and the system time zone was UTC -08:00 and the TOU map
time zone was UTC -05:00 then the TOU map data entry would be written as 1/1/2010 2:00PM.

###### Impacts on Factors

Factor effective dates do not have a time zone associated to them and are assumed to be in the local time zone of the data
being validated. For example a factor effective 4/1/2010 12:00AM would be considered to be effective 4/1/2010 12:00AM
UTC -08:00 and 4/1/2010 12:00AM UTC -05:00 based on the time zones of the respective meters. This allows a single
factor to apply to many time zones and behave uniformly.

###### Impacts on Holidays

Holiday effective dates do not have a time zone associated to them and are assumed to be in the local time zone of the data
being validated. For example a holiday on 12/25/2010 would be considered to be effective beginning 12/25/2010 12:00AM
UTC -08:00 and 12/25/2010 12:00AM UTC -05:00 based on the time zones of the respective meters.

###### Impacts on Periodic Estimation

Refer to About Periodic Estimation for more information about the impact of Daylight Savings Time on periodic estimation.

###### Impacts on Initial Measurement Creation Online

When creating initial measurements online from the 360 Degree View portals, initial measurements are created as
appropriate for measuring components with time zones other than the base time zone.

For example, if you copy measurements from a measuring component in one time zone to a measuring component in a
different time zone, the measurements are being moved in absolute time (i.e. the 3:00 PM in UTC -08:00 would be changed
6:00PM in UTC -05:00).

###### Impacts on Items

The consumption for "badged" and "unbadged" items is driven by configuration on the device type service quantity and the
multi-item section of the service point:


-----

- **Device Type Service Quantity: the effective date of the service quantity does not have a time zone and is assumed to**
be in the local time zone of the service point it is associated to (whether through a install event for "badged" items or
by being directly configured on the service point). For example an effective date time of 1/1/2010 5:00PM would be
considered to be effective beginning 1/1/2010 5:00PM UTC -08:00 and 1/1/2010 5:00PM UTC -05:00 based on the time
zones of the respective meters

- **Service Point Multi-Item: the start date time and end date time of the multi-item list are stored in legal time of the base**
time zone and displayed in the legal time of the service point's time zone.

#### Service Issue Monitors

##### About Service Issue Monitors

Service Issue Monitors are service tasks that analyze service points to determine if service is needed. If service is
determined to be needed, the Service Issue Monitor creates a Service Investigative Order.

Device events, VEE exceptions, failed smart meter commands, and other events can trigger the creation of a service issue
monitor (the type of service issue monitor created is based on the Service Issue Monitor Type specified on the device event
type, exception type, or activity type). Once created, service issue monitors analyze the service point where the device
associated with the device event, VEE exception, or failed command, based on evaluation criteria specified on the service
issue monitor's type. If the criteria are met (in other words, if a specified number of command failures, device events, or
VEE exceptions are found for the service point), the service issue monitor creates a service investigative order.

###### Service Issue Monitor Creation

This section provides an overview of the process that takes place when service issue monitors are created.

**NOTE:** The process outlined below has been simplified for illustrative purposes, and does not reference every step
performed in this process.

**1. One (or more) of the following takes place:**

   - A device event or reader remark is received, whose type specifies a Service Issues Monitor Type

   - A VEE exception whose type specifies a Service Issues Monitor Type is generated during VEE processing

   - A usage transaction exception generated during usage calculation

   - A smart meter command fails whose type specifies a Service Issues Monitor Type

   - A business flag is received whose type specifies a Service Issue Monitor Type

**2. The object received in item (1) creates a service issue monitor based on the referenced Service Issue Monitor Type**

**3. The service issue monitors analyzes the service point based on the Discard Rules and Evaluation Criteria defined on the**
service issue monitor's type to determine if a service investigative order should be created or if the service issue monitor
should be discarded.

The "Discard Rules" on the service issue monitor's type are evaluated to determine if the new service issue monitor
should be discarded (new service issue monitors are always discarded when created if an existing service investigative
order initiated by a service issue monitor of the same type exists for the service point.)

If the service issue monitor type was configured to require approval, the service issue monitor generates a To Do to
notify the appropriate individuals that approval is necessary.

If the service issue monitor is approved or if no approval was necessary the service investigative order will be continue.


-----

**4. The service issue monitor then executes the evaluation criteria defined on the service issue monitor's type. If those**
criteria are met the Service Investigative Order activity is created. If the criteria are not met the service issue monitor is
discarded.

**5. If the service issue monitor has completion criteria defined the service issue monitor will wait for the service**
investigative order to complete. Once complete the the service issue monitor will execute the completion criteria to
evaluate if the service investigative order achieved the desired results.

If either there were no completion criteria or they were satisfied the service issue monitor will complete.

If the completion criteria were not satisfied the service issue monitor enter an inconclusive investigation state from
which manual intervention will be required.

##### About Service Investigative Orders

Service investigative orders are activities created by a service issue monitor when a specified set of events have occurred at
a service point. The type of activity created by the service issue monitor is defined on the service issue monitor's type.

Service issue monitors are often configured to create field activities that are in turn sent to an external field work system.

#### Settlement

##### Understanding Market Settlement

Market settlement is the process of reconciling the difference between a supplier’s energy purchases and its customer’s
usage. Suppliers purchase energy via bilateral contracts and day-ahead market transactions. Any differences between
these purchases and supplier customer usage must be determined by the market and charged or credited at real time prices.
The supplier’s customer usage is not directly determined by the market, but by numerous other market participants that
track customer supplier enrollments, aggregate customer usage to the supplier, and submit supplier’s usage schedule
to the market. This process is called load settlement, and is the primary purpose of Oracle Utilities Market Settlements
Management.

The market participant responsible for load settlement can differ per market. For example, load settlement for a large
portion of the Texas market is performed by an Independent System Operator (ISO) known as the Electric Reliability
Council of Texas (ERCOT), whereas in the PJM market (encompassing Pennsylvania, New Jersey, and Maryland) load
settlement is the responsibility of the Electric Distribution Company (EDC). While there are significant differences between
markets in how load settlement is preformed, the high-level process steps are basically the same.

Load settlement starts with the bottom up aggregation of actual load or estimated load for individual customer accounts
or service points. Distribution and transmission losses are added in to calculate an unreconciled load amount. The
market determines the total generation supplied to a zone and the difference with the unreconciled load is referred to as
Unaccounted for Energy (UFE). The UFE is then allocated to suppliers on a load ratio share basis.


-----

The load settlement process is typically performed multiple times. The “preliminary” load settlement is done soon after
the Operational Day and is often based on estimated load. The “final” load settlement is done around 60 days after the
Operational Day, so that actual data has been received and customer bills issued.

###### About Market Settlement Processing

Market settlement is the process of deriving billing determinants to be used in supplier billing based on the results of a data
aggregation processes.

The load settlement process also involves calculating imbalances. An imbalance is the difference between two load
shapes representing different estimates of the same period, typically a scheduled load shape and an actual load shape.
Imbalances are typically used when money has changed hands based on an estimate that has been improved or finalized by
the settlement process. Because the second estimate has more accurate data, the allocations performed by the first process
have to be modified.

Imbalance shapes can be further divided by applying bands and TOU components. Bands are error tolerances around zero
that allow for differential pricing of the imbalance curve by how well or poorly the scheduled estimate matched the actual
usage. Time of Use periods are often defined, allowing a higher penalty for faulty forecasting during higher-priced, on-peak
periods. Whether an imbalance calculation is performed and how it is performed varies greatly from market to market.

The following sections provide details regarding some of the specific processing used in settlement processing.

###### Importing Data

In addition to customer-level data such as meter readings or billed service quantities (which are used aggregation),
settlement processing also involves other data that must be available to the application. For example:

- UFE calculations use both aggregated data and overall system, or zonal, load data

- Estimations and forecasting often use weather data

- Settlement billing requires pricing data

Data of these types can be imported into the system from external sources via a number of ways:

- For external sources that send data on a regular basis, data can be imported in a manner similar to how measurement data
is received head end systems. See Processing Initial Measurement Data in this guide and Data Import - Message Driven
Bean Configuration in the Oracle Utilities Meter Solution Administrative User Guide for more information.

- For external systems that send data upon request, data can be requested via measuring component data requests. Requests
of this type can be either scheduled or performed manually. See Requesting Measurement Data in this guide for more
information.

- For external systems that make data available for use but don’t support sending the data directly, data can be imported
manually in a comma separated values (CSV) format. See Uploading Measurement Data in this guide for more
information.

###### Forecasting and Estimating Usage

Some settlement processes, such as initial settlement, often have to be performed before actual usage has been received
or calculated for service points participating in the settlement market. In these cases, usage must be estimated, and in
some cases, forecasted before aggregation and other settlement calculations can happen. A forecast is the term used when
estimating usage data for future dates based on historical or profile data. Backcasting is the term used for estimating data for
dates in the past. These can also be based on historical and/or profile data.

Two specific methods used for forecasting and backcasting include:


-----

- **Profile Estimation: This method uses profile data that represents typical usage for the service point to estimate usage. In**
some cases, profile data can also be adjusted based on scalar usage for the same service point.

- **Proxy Day Estimation: This process compares data between measuring components to identify an historical day that**
most closely matches the date for which data is needed and uses data from that historical day to estimate usage

###### Aggregating Data

Aggregation involves summing real or assigned (profiled or deemed) interval data to a user-defined aggregation level for
further processing. Aggregation may occur at a variety of levels for a variety of reasons, including reporting requirements
and applying losses and other factors at an aggregated level up to the market participation level. Aggregation is typically
used to build ground-up estimates of load for energy market participants for forecasting, scheduling, and settlement.

Aggregation is performed using the Dynamic Aggregation feature of the Oracle Utilities Meter Solution.

###### Aggregation Levels

Because aggregation involves summing up interval data to a specified level for processing, it’s important to understand
what is meant by the term “aggregation level” Put simply, an aggregation level is any point along the distribution chain to
which entities below that point are summed. For instance, if you were going to sum up all the accounts that are related to
a specific bus, that bus would be an aggregation level. Similarly, if you were going to aggregate all the energy used by all
the accounts for a given Energy Service Provider (ESP), that ESP would be an aggregation level. In general, aggregation is
usually performed at a level below you on the distribution chain from generators to end users.

The entities and/or market participants that serve as aggregation levels are specific to the particular area and market in
which your utility is operating, but can include the following:

**Energy Service Providers (ESP)**
Energy Service Providers (ESPs) sell power to customers. They may generate it and/or buy it from other sources. ESPs are
also referred to as Retail Energy Providers (REPs) or simply suppliers.

**Distribution Companies (DisCo)**
A distribution company is responsible for the delivery of power to all customers in its service territory (Jurisdiction),
regardless of who the customers have selected as their suppliers. The DisCo owns and operates the distribution lines that
bring electricity into homes and businesses, and is responsible for metering, billing, and service calls. However, a DisCo
may or may not be affiliated with a customer’s power supplier. Distribution companies are also referred to as Operating
Companies, Utility Distribution Companies (UDCs), or Local Distribution Companies (LDCs).

**Schedule/Service Coordinators (SC)**
Schedule Coordinators (or Service Coordinators) are responsible for creating schedules of energy usage that represent the
estimated usage for a future time period (most often one day) for a given segment of the market. Schedules are most often
based on results generated during the load profiling process, but can also be based on historical usage information and other
data.

**Independent System Operators (ISO)**
An Independent System Operator (ISO) is a non-profit corporation that manages the regional power grid to coordinate
the generation and transmission of energy. Its goal is to guarantee a safe and reliable power supply, and to ensure that all
suppliers get nondiscriminatory access to the transmission system (while the ISO controls the power grid, commercial
entities still own it). In the U.S.market, ISOs are regulated by the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission (FERC).

The various aggregation levels used in settlement processing are defined by Aggregation Groups, Measuring Component
Sets, and Aggregation Measuring Components.

###### Aggregation Dimensions


-----

In addition to aggregating data by aggregation levels, it is useful to be able to aggregate by other factors, such as customer
class, voltage class, or loss class. These and other factors are referred as dimensions and are referenced on measuring
component sets. Some common aggregation dimensions are described below. Note that these are provided as examples of
common aggregation dimensions only.

Specific markets may require aggregation dimensions other than those listed here.

**Customer Class**
A customer class represents a ‘type’ of customer or account. Three common customer classes include residential,
commercial, and industrial, but others are also prevalent. In addition, there may be multiple types of residential,
commercial, or industrial classes, representing distinct types of accounts within each of those broad categories. For instance,
residential customers might be divided into apartments, condominiums, and houses.

**Voltage Class**
A voltage class represents a group of customers or accounts based on the type of voltage used by the end users in that
group. Voltage classes differ by market and region, but some common voltage classes include Transmission, Primary, and
Secondary. Aggregating by voltage class is often performed for reporting purposes, to track usage of a given voltage type
within the system.

**Loss Class**
A loss class represents a group of customers or accounts based on the type of loss (transmission loss, distribution loss, etc.)
associated with those accounts. Loss is often related to voltage levels, and so correlations between loss classes and voltage
classes are common. Aggregation by loss class is used when calculating losses in the overall settlement process, and allows
different loss calculation algorithms to be used with different loss classes, as appropriate.

**Rate Class**
A rate class represents a group of customers or accounts based on pricing. Rate classes can be based on a number of
characteristics, including usage, territory, or even voltage type.

These and other dimensions are typically defined as attributes or characteristics of usage subscriptions, service points,
devices, or measuring components.

###### Applying Losses

Markets typically operate using generation-level determinants, meaning that the individual metered entity data must be
adjusted for system losses in order to compare the market participant load to the system load, market participant schedules,
etc. Loss calculations can vary from simple to complex, ranging from an annual percentage by rate class or voltage level,
to seasonal or time of use loss factors, to hourly dynamic loss factor calculations based on system conditions. Loss factors
can be applied at the metered level or any aggregation level, as needed. In addition, losses can be applied to generators in
markets where generation losses are calculated and used.

Applying losses to aggregated data is performed via value derivation algorithms. These are algorithms which apply a
configured formula to aggregated measurement values. For instance, to apply a loss factor, an algorithm can retrieve
effective-dated factor values for a loss factor and multiply each aggregated measurement value by the appropriate factor
value. Value derivation algorithms can retrieve values from all types of factors, including multi-variable factors defined for
settlement units. See Aggregation Calculation — Other Calculations for more information about how losses can be applied
during data aggregation.

###### Unaccounted for Energy (UFE) Calculations

Unaccounted for Energy (UFE) is calculated by comparing the known system load to the sum of all market participant
estimates from the estimation, aggregation, and loss adjustment processes. Because the market participant estimates will
never perfectly match the system load, these estimates are fine-tuned by allocating a portion of the total UFE to each


-----

estimate. Allocation methods differ, but in general each market participant is allocated a portion of the system UFE for
each hour based on the ratio of that particular estimate's load in that hour to the total of all estimated loads in that hour.
This process forces the total of all estimates to match the system load. Some markets use different UFE allocation methods,
including differential allocation of UFE to interval metered loads apart from profiled loads, and adjusting the profile
methodologies to minimize UFE where possible.

UFE calculations are performed as part of the settlement calculation process, and can be performed using the Measuring
Component Set Calculation Rule settlement calculation rule defined in a Bulk Settlement Calculation Group executed via
the Measuring Component Set Calculation (D1-MCSCA) batch process.

For smaller markets, UFE calculations can be performed using a chained sequence of Array Math and Vector and Service
Quantity Math settlement calculation rules. At a basic level, this sequence looks like this:

**1. Sum the market participant load from aggregation results (using Array Math)**

**2. Subtract the market participant load from the system load to derive the total UFE for the calculation period (using**
Vector and Service Quantity Math)

**3. Allocate the total UFE to the various market participants as appropriate (using Array Math)**

**NOTE:** The results of UFE calculations are also used in other settlement calculations. These three steps represent part of
a larger set of calculations.

###### Allocating Load via Market Products, Awards, and Contracts

Distribution companies operating in deregulated markets are often designated as the Provider of Last Resort (POLR) for
customers that either have not selected a supplier or have been dropped by a supplier. If allowed by legal and market rules,
the distribution company can elect to outsource the responsibility of supplying POLR load to qualified wholesalers.

The POLR consumers will still, either directly or indirectly, receive bills for distribution services from and pay the
distribution company, but the wholesaler takes responsibility for procuring and serving the POLR load, for which they
receive payments from the distribution company.

A simple example of the POLR allocation process might involve the following steps:

**1. Subtract all other suppliers from the zonal load to get the remaining POLR load.**

**2. Allow for the distribution company to separate out any owned generation.**

**3. Divide POLR load amongst awarded wholesale contracts.**

Details of these transactions would be sent to the market operator by contract ID.

These awards of POLR load can be defined in the application by Market Products (which belong to a Market Product Set),
Market Awards, and Market Contracts.

To elaborate on the example above, a market product set might the following set of market products:

- A product and award to carve out load from the POLR load for one or more suppliers. This would be a “Fixed Profile”
award.

- A product and award to carve out a percentage of the remaining POLR load for owned generation. This would be a
“Percentage” award.

- A product and awards that distribute the remaining POLR into various bundles of tranches (chunks of load) to
wholesalers. These would be “Tranche” awards.

The following diagram illustrates the way in which this distribution would work.


-----

-----

The Market Award Allocation settlement calculation rule is used to perform the allocation of load the designated market
products and awards. This rule is part of a larger settlement calculation process, using settlement quantities (the POLR
load) calculated by other rules (such as Array Math and Vector and Service Quantity Math). The Market Award Allocation
rule allocates those quantities to the products within a specified Market Product Set, and saves the results for export to the
appropriate market participants.

##### Viewing Settlement Calculation Results

You can view settlement calculation results using the Cube Viewer feature of the Oracle Utilities Application Framework.
See Creating Cube Views in the Oracle Utilities Application Framework Administrative User Guide for information about
configuring cube views.

##### Viewing and Managing Settlement Processes

You can use the Process Flows feature of the Oracle Utilities Application Framework to create, view, and manage
settlement processes. See Process Flows in the Oracle Utilities Application Framework Administrative User Guide for
information about configuring cube views.

##### Settlement Data Snapshots

Settlement data snapshots capture data as of a specific point in time for use in aggregation and settlement calculations. For
instance, data snapshots can capture data such as:

- The state of a settlement account (a Settlement Item) as of the last time something about the account changed

- The state of a settlement account as of the last time the account was billed

- Metered measurement data used for initial settlement

- Billed measurement data used for final settlement

There are two general categories of settlement data snapshots:

- Attribute Data Snapshots

- Measurement Data Snapshots

###### Attribute Values

 About Attribute Values

Attribute values represent an instance of an attribute group's values, captured as part of an attribute data snapshot for a
settlement item. An individual attribute values record is created for each unique combination of values that exists for the
attributes defined in the attribute group.

Attribute values records are created when attribute data snapshots are created or updated for a settlement item.

Attribute values are defined by:

- **Attribute Group: The attribute group that defines the attributes captured by the attribute values record**

- **Division: The division to which the settlement item captured by the attribute values record belongs**

- **Market: The market in which the settlement item captured by the attribute values record participants.**


-----

- **Market Participant: The market participant associated with the settlement item captured by the attribute values record**

- **Rate Class : The rate class code for the settlement item captured by the attribute values record.**

- **Status: The status of the attribute values record**

- **Values: The specific values captured in the attribute values record, defined by the record’s attribute group**

###### Maintaining Attribute Values

You use the Attribute Value portal to view and maintain attribute values records.

Refer to About Attribute Values for additional functional information.

You can access the portal by selecting Main, then Customer Information, then Attribute Values. You are brought to a
query portal with options for searching. Once your record has been selected you are brought to the maintenance portal to
view and maintain the selected record.

The following zones may appear as part of the portal's Main tab page:

- **Attribute Values: This zone displays the attribute values record.**

###### Attribute Data Snapshots

 About Attribute Data Snapshots

Attribute data snapshots are used to capture account data for a settlement item as of a specific point in time, such as the last
time an attribute on the account changed or the last time it was billed.

Attribute data snapshots are defined by:

- **Attribute Data Snapshot Type: The attribute data snapshot type for this snapshot.**

- **Division: The division to which the settlement account captured by the attribute data snapshot belongs.**

- **Attribute Value: The attribute value record that contains attribute values for the attribute data snapshot**

- **Status: The status of the attribute data snapshot**

- **Stop Effective Date/Time: The stop date/time for period represented by the data snapshot.**

- **Time Zone: The time zone of the settlement account captured by the attribute data snapshot**

- **Identifiers: The specific identifier types and values for the attribute data snapshot’s settlement item**

###### Creating Attribute Data Snapshots

Attribute data snapshots are created via batch processing. Attribute data snapshots are typically generated daily (or on some
other regular schedule) via the Capture Attribute Data Snapshot (D1-CADS) batch control. This batch process invokes the
Capture Attribute Data Snapshot (D1-CAPADS) monitor algorithm on the Active state of the Settlement Item business
object.

Attribute data snapshots are created for each change in one of the attributes that has been configured on the Attribute Data
Snapshot Type and Attribute Group. The snapshot captures the value of all of the attributes at the time of that change. For


-----

example, for Attribute Data Snapshot Type configured to track Market Participant, Rate Class, and a Characteristic, if the
Characteristic value were updated with a new more recently effective value then a snapshot would be created that would
capture all 3 fields values (the Market Participant, Rate Class, and new Characteristic value)..

The type of attribute data snapshot(s) created are defined on the the Settlement Item’s Settlement Item Type.

###### Maintaining Attribute Data Snapshots

You use the Attribute Data Snapshot portal to view and maintain attribute data snapshots.

Refer to About Attribute Data Snapshots for additional functional information.

You can access the portal by selecting Main, then Customer Information, then Attribute Data Snapshot. You are
brought to a query portal with options for searching. Once your record has been selected you are brought to the maintenance
portal to view and maintain the selected record.

The following zones may appear as part of the portal's Main tab page:

- **Attribute Data Snapshot: This zone displays the attribute data snapshot.**

###### Measurement Data Snapshots

 About Measurement Data Snapshots

Measurement data snapshots are used to capture measurement data for settlement accounts as of a specific point in time,
such as the when the data was used for initial settlement or when the account was billed.

###### Creating Measurement Data Snapshots

Measurement data snapshots can be created either via batch extract processing or as part of usage transaction processing.
Batch extract processing is typically run daily (or on some other regular basis) and is used primarily for initial settlement
calculations. Usage transaction processing is most often used to create ”final” or billed” measurements used with final
settlement calculations.

Both approaches support creation of measurement data snapshots for use with implementations in which Meter Data
Management and Market Settlements Management are installed in separate application environments, or in a single
application environment.

###### Batch Extract Processing

As noted above, batch extract processing is typically run daily (or on some other regular basis). Measurement data snapshot
creation via batch extract processing is based on configuration of two types of objects:

- Consumption Extract Types

- Batch Controls

There are three types of batch extract processing based on the type of measurement data: interval measurements, scalar
measurements, and items. The table below outlines the consumption extract type business objects and batch controls used
for each type of data.


**Data Type** **Consumption Extract Type Business**
**Object**

Interval US Extract Intervals to MDS (D1–

ConsExtractTypeInterval)

Scalar US Extract Item to MDS (D1–

ConsExtractTypeItem)

Items US Extract to Scalar Measurement Snapshot

(D1–ConsExtractTypeScalar)


**Batch Control**

Extract US Intervals to Measurement Data

Snapshots (D1–EUSIM)

Extract US Item Consumption to

Measurement Data Snapshots (D1–EUITM)

Extract US Scalar Reads to Measurement

Data Snapshots (D1–EUSSR)


The following sections provide additional details about the consumption extract types and batch controls used for
measurement data snapshot creation.

**Consumption Extract Types**
Consumption extract types define several parameters used by the measurement data snapshot extract process. As outlined in
the table above, there is a separate consumption extract type business object for each type of data.

See Understanding Consumption Extract Types for general information about consumption extract types.

Measurement data snapshot consumption extract types are defined by the following:

- **Extraction Through Date/Time: The date and time through which extract requests for this extract type have been**
processed

- **Extraction Cutoff Time: The time at which extract requests of this extract type are cutoff**

- **Extraction Parameters: Parameters used in extraction processing, including:**

  - **Subscription Type: The type of subscription (Settlements or CIS) for which extracts of this type are processed.**

  - **Request Type: The request type associated with the extraction type.**

  - **Frequency: The frequency at which extract requests of this extract type are processed. Frequency options include**
Adhoc and Automated Daily.


-----

  - **Measurement Data Snapshot Type: The measurement data snapshot type used to create measurement data**
snapshots based on this extract type. The UOM of the snapshots must be compatible with at least one of the UOMs
in the list of Usage Subscription Types. In addition, type’s UOM / SPI combinations must be compatible with at
least one of the UOM / SPI combination listed in the Usage Subscription Types list. Used with Scalar and Item
consumption extracts only.

  - **Extraction Batch Control: The batch control used to extract the measurement data to measurement data snapshots,**
based on the type of data to extract and the consumption extract type.

**Data Type** **Batch Control**

Interval Extract US Intervals to Measurement Data Snapshots (D1–

EUSIM)

Scalar Extract US Item Consumption to Measurement Data

Snapshots (D1–EUITM)

Items Extract US Scalar Reads to Measurement Data Snapshots

(D1–EUSSR)

  - **Extract To Different Usage Subscription: A flag that designates whether or not the measurement data snapshot**
should be extracted to a different usage subscription such as one used by Market Settlements Management. Options
include:

    - **No: The extract will reference the usage subscription for which usage calculations are being processed. This option**
is used when Meter Data Management and Market Settlements Management are installed in different application
environments. In this case, the extract can be exported from Meter Data Management for subsequence import into
Market Settlements Management.

    - **Yes: The extract will reference a different usage subscription such as one used by Market Settlements**
Management. This option is used when Meter Data Management and Market Settlements Management are
installed in the same application environment. In this case, the measurement data snapshot is “exported” within the
system to the Settlement Item, where it can be used in data aggregation processing.
When this option is selected, the Source Identifier Type and Target Identifier Type fields must be configured to
define how the system will determine the correct settlement usage subscription to use.

- **Irregular Data Flag Mapping: Ranges of condition codes used to flag data as “irregular”. The value of the Irregular**
**Data Flag (based on the IRREGULAR_DATA_FLG lookup) is used to flag data that falls with each range configured. A**
blank Irregular Flag value denotes that the condition range is considered to be "Regular".

- **Usage Subscription Types: One or more usage subscription types from which the consumption can be extracted and**
stored into measurement data snapshots

- **Measurement Data Snapshot Types: One more measurement data snapshot types used to create measurement data**
snapshots based on this extract type. The UOM of these snapshots must be compatible with at least one of the UOMs in
the list of Usage Subscription Types. There must be at least one Measurement Data Snapshot type defined in this list for
each UOM / SPI combination listed in the Usage Subscription Types list. Used with Interval consumption extracts only.

**Consumption Extract Batch Controls**
Consumption extract batch controls define the consumption extract type and date range used for the measurement data
snapshot creation process. As outlined in the table above, there is a separate consumption extract batch control for each type
of data.

Al three batch controls use the same parameters:

- **Consumption Extract Type: The consumption extract type for which the batch will be executed. The consumption**
extract type business object should align with data type of the batch control (interval, scalar, or item).

- **Start Date/Time: The start of the period that will be extracted**

- **End Date/Time: The end of the period that will be extracted**


-----

Each batch control uses a distinct pair of algorithms to select the records to process (Select Records) and to create the
measurement data snapshots (Process Records). The table below outlines the algorithms used with each batch control.

###### Usage Transaction Processing

Measurement data snapshots can be creating during usage transaction processing through configuration of the Daily Scalar
Calculation Rule, Get Interval, Get Item Counts and Consumption, and Get Scalar Details usage calculation rules. When
these are configured properly, the usage calculation process calculates service quantities and extracts measurement data
for snapshots. See Understanding Usage Calculation Rules for more information about configuring usage rules to create
measurement data snapshots.

**Initial Measurement Snapshots**
When measurement data snapshots are created via usage transaction processing as a result of a request for billing
determinants from a billing system (including the billing functionality in Customer To Meter), initial measurement
snapshots are created to “hold” the snapshots while the “Used on Bill” flag on the usage transaction is set to “No”. When
the “Used on Bill” flag is updated the “Yes”, the measurement data snapshot is created from the initial measurement
snapshot. See

About Initial Measurement Snapshots for more information.

###### Maintaining Measurement Data Snapshots

You use the Settlement Item portal to view and maintain measurement data snapshots.

Refer to About Measurement Data Snapshots for additional functional information.

###### Initial Measurement Snapshots

 About Initial Measurement Snapshots

Initial measurement snapshots are used to hold measurement data snapshots until they are ready to be processed. Examples
of initial measurement snapshots include:

- Measurement data snapshots created as part of usage transaction processing, but where the usage transaction’s “Used on
Bill” flag is set to “No”.

- Imported measurement data snapshots that encounter an error of some sort during import, such as if the Usage
Subscription or Settlement Item for the snapshot can’t be found.

Initial measurement snapshots are defined by:

- **Usage Subscription: The usage subscription related to the initial measurement snapshot (if applicable)**


-----

- **Settlement Item: The settlement related to the initial measurement snapshot (if applicable)**

- **Usage Transaction ID: The usage transaction related to the initial measurement snapshot**

- **Status: The current status of the initial measurement snapshot**

- **Transaction ID: The transaction ID of a related transaction, such as a bill.**

Initial measurement snapshots in error can also include the following information:

- **Current Error Message: An message explaining the error that resulted in the creation of the initial measurement**
snapshot

- **External System: The external system that sent the measurement data snapshot**

- **Measurement Data Snapshot Type: The measurement data snapshot’s type**

- **Service Point ID: The service point associated with the initial measurement snapshot, if applicable**

- **Measuring Component ID: The measuring component associated with the initial measurement snapshot, if applicable**

- **File Name: The file name for the import file used to create the measurement data snapshot**

- **Start Date/Time: The start date and time for the initial measurement snapshot**

- **End Date/Time: The end date and time for the initial measurement snapshot (applies to scalar snapshots only)**

###### Initial Measurement Snapshot Business Objects

The system includes the following initial measurement snapshot business objects:

- **Initial Measurement Snapshot Export to US (D1–InitMsrmtSnapExporttoUS): Used for snapshot data during the time**
period when billing determinants have been sent to the billing system but the billing system has not yet confirmed that
they have been used on a finalized bill (the “Used on Bill” flag is set to “No”). This is used when the data is being staged
under the Usage Subscription for eventual export to the Settlement Item.

- **Initial Measurement Snapshot Export to SI (D1–InitMsrmtSnapExporttoSI): Used for snapshot data during the time**
period when billing determinants have been sent to the billing system but the billing system has not yet confirmed that
they have been used on a finalized bill (the “Used on Bill” flag is set to “No”). This is used when the data is being
created directly underneath the Settlement Item.

- **Initial Measurement Snapshot Import (D1–InitMsrmtSnapImport): Used to captures the details of an imported**
measurement data snapshot that has encountered an error during processing.

###### Maintaining Initial Measurement Snapshots

##### Settlement Calculations

###### About Settlement Calculations

Oracle Utilities Market Settlements Management can calculate and publish settlement results calculated from aggregated
data to market participants on an ongoing basis. Settlement calculations derive a settlement transaction's service quantities
using the aggregated measurement associated with one or more market participants.

Before settlement results can be calculated, you must first create a Settlement Subscription. The settlement subscription
defines the external system to which the data should be sent as well as the settlement calculation groups that will be used for


-----

calculation. The settlement calculation rules defined for the settlement calculation groups are responsible for performing the
specific calculations, validations, or estimations for settlement results.

Settlement service quantities are derived from aggregated measurement data the calculation period.

The results of all calculations performed by settlement subscriptions are stored as a Settlement Transaction.

The settlement calculation process has a number of different objects that are detailed below that allow for configurability
and flexibility in how the process executes.

###### Settlement Calculation Groups

Settlement calculation groups are collections of settlement calculation rules that are used to calculate service quantities for
market participants. During the settlement transaction process, the system executes the settlement calculation rules defined
in the settlement calculation group referenced on the settlement subscription. The rules within a settlement calculation group
are defined in a specific sequence, allowing control over the order in which the rules are executed.

For information on configuration, reference the related section for Configuring Settlement Calculation Groups in the
Administrative User Guide.

###### Settlement Calculation Rules

The specific calculation processing performed on a settlement transaction is defined in individual settlement calculation
rules, each performing a specific set of targeted logic. The base product contains many settlement calculation rules you
can use in your implementation, but you can also create your own custom settlement calculation rules. Many settlement
calculation rules are identical to usage calculation rules used by Oracle Utilities Meter Data Management

For a list of validation settlement calculation rules, reference the About Usage Validations section. For a list of estimation
usage calculation rules, reference the About Usage Estimations section. For a list of all other usage calculation rules that
handle calculation of bill determinants, reference the Inventory of Other Usage Calculation Rules section.

For information on configuration, reference the related section for Configuring Settlement Calculation Rules in the
Administrative User Guide.

###### Settlement Transaction Exceptions

Each settlement calculation rule defines an exception type and severity that specify how exceptions are tracked by the
system. When a settlement transaction fails some part of a settlement calculation rule, an exception of the type specified for
the failed settlement calculation rule is created. A single settlement transaction can have multiple exceptions, one (or more)
for each rule that failed. This allows users to see all of the problems detected during the settlement calculation process.

There are three levels of severity for settlement transaction exceptions:

- **Information: Used to highlight minor issues, but not sufficient to cause the settlement transaction to be put into a failure**
state. Exceptions of this category can be used to report on the frequency of interesting, but not fatal issues

- **Issues: Used to report a problem that will prevent the settlement transaction from being exported. Multiple "issue**
exceptions" can be created during settlement transaction processing. If at least one issue exists after all rules have been
applied, the settlement transaction is transitioned to a failure state requiring review and approval.

- **Terminate: Used to report a severe issue that will cause the settlement calculation process to stop and the settlement**
transaction to be transitioned immediately to a failure state requiring review and approval. Only one terminate exception
can be issued (as the first one causes calculation processing to stop on for a settlement transaction). This should be used
for cases where manual override / approval isn't accurate. For example, a "Curve Not Continuous" error that says the
interval data doesn't cover the full settlement period should always be set to Terminate as an Exception Severity.

Note that exceptions are not deleted when a settlement transaction is adjusted or corrected. After any issues are corrected
or the settlement transaction is overridden (or manually completed), the exceptions persist in a closed state for reporting
purposes.

In addition to exceptions, settlement processing can also trigger the creation of To Do Entries related to issues. If Issue
or terminate exceptions exist for an initial measurement, a To Do Entry is created when the settlement transaction is


-----

transitioned to the Exception state. The To Do Type and default To Do Role of this To Do Entry are defined on the Enter
system event for the Exception state of the business object used to define the settlement transaction.

To Do Entries created in this way can be routed to different roles depending on the exception's message category and
number (using the To Do Type's Message Overrides tab).

For information on configuration, reference the related section for Configuring Usage Transaction Exception Types in the
Administration Guide.

###### Settlement Calculation Rule Eligibility Criteria

Settlement calculation rule eligibility criteria are user-definable conditions that could cause a given settlement calculation
rule to be applied or skipped. This can involve the evaluation of some attribute of the settlement subscription or something
else entirely. A settlement calculation rule can have multiple eligibility criteria for determining if the rule should be applied
or skipped, based on a user-defined sequence. Eligibility criteria for settlement calculation rules works in the same manner
as eligibility criteria for usage calculation rules used by Oracle Utilities Meter Data Management.

For information on configuration, reference the related section for Configuring Usage Calculation Rules in the
Administrative User Guide.

###### Settlement Subscriptions

 About Settlement Subscriptions

Settlement subscriptions track the ongoing need to calculate a set of data, often aggregated load, for the purpose of settling a
market and send the results to a recipient.

Settlement subscriptions must reference the following:

- **Recipient: The identity of the subscribing system. In other words, you must set up a recipient for any system that**
subscribes to settlement calculations.

- **Settlement Calculation Groups: The calculation groups used to perform settlement calculations for settlement**
transactions based on this settlement subscription. Settlement calculation groups can be configured in a specific sequence
of execution. In addition, each group can be configured to require approval before the calculation execution proceeds to
the next calculation group.

Settlement subscriptions can also reference the following;

- **Factor Overrides: One or more factors can be used as override values when performing calculations**

- **Measuring Components: One or more measuring components directly linked to the settlement subscription. These are**
most often aggregation measuring components, but can also include profile measuring components.

- **Measuring Component Sets: One or more measuring component sets directly linked to the settlement subscription.**

###### Maintaining Settlement Subscriptions

You use the portal Settlement Subscription portal to view and maintain settlement subscriptions.

Refer to About Settlement Subscriptions for additional functional information.

You can access the portal from the Main > Settlement > Settlement Subscription. You are brought to a query portal with
options for searching. Once your record has been selected you are brought to the maintenance portal to view and maintain
the selected record.

The following zones may appear as part of the portal's Main tab page:


-----

- **Settlement Subscription: This zone displays basic information about the settlement subscription, including factor**
overrides, settlement calculation groups, measuring components and measuring component sets.

- **Settlement Transaction: This zone displays a list of settlement transactions for the settlement subscription.**

###### Settlement Transactions

 About Settlement Transactions

Settlement transactions are records of calculations for a settlement subscription. All of the service quantities calculated are
stored as part of the settlement transaction.

###### Settlement Calculation Group Determination

The first step in settlement calculation is to determine the settlement calculation group holding the rules set used in
calculating or validating the calculations. There are two ways of configuring the settlement calculation group to use in the
processing. It may be specified on the settlement subscription during its creation with an effective and expiration date. If
there are no settlement calculation groups in effect for the settlement transaction, the Fallback Settlement Calculation
**Group specified in the settlement subscription type will be used.**

###### Calculation Period

Settlement transaction requests must specify the date range for the settlement transaction. This date range is referred to as
the calculation period for the settlement transaction.

###### Date Breaks

Date breaks are used to break up a settlement period into sub-periods based on the dates on which changes took place for
market participants. One approach to this situation would be for the system to crate settlement transactions (where each
has the desired date range). Another approach is for the system to create single settlement transaction with date breaks that
define the date ranges before and after the change.

If a settlement transaction has date break(s), the settlement calculation engine segregates the usage into multiple calculation
periods based on the date breaks. If there are no date breaks in the settlement transaction, a single calculation period is
created for the entire calculation period.

###### Service Quantities

Every settlement period created for a settlement transaction contains one or more service quantities. Service quantities are
calculated by the settlement calculation group's rules specified for the settlement subscription from which the settlement
transaction is created. For example, a settlement transaction might have quantities calculated by a single rule that applies a
TOU map to aggregated kWh .

Each service quantity lists details about that quantity, including a UOM (or TOU or SQI as appropriate) and a quantity. In
addition, each service quantity also references the source (measuring component) of the quantities (for audit purposes).

###### Quality Assessment

The Get Interval Data, Get Scalar Details, and Get Time of Use Mapped Usage calculation rules include a "Perform
Measurement Quality Assessment" option that indicates (yes or no) if the measurement conditions of the measurements
used when calculating usage should be evaluated and included in the resulting settlement transaction and outbound message.
When enabled (set to "Yes"), the calculation rule algorithm evaluates the condition codes of the measurements used in the
calculation to determine if they fall within a "Regular" range of conditions (this range is defined by the "Bottom Regular
Condition Range" and "Top Regular Condition Range" algorithm parameters). The result of this assessment is displayed in
the "Data Quality Assessment" column in the Calcuatio0n Periods section which indicates if the service quantity is based on


-----

"regular" or "non- regular" data. (If the "Perform Measurement Quality Assessment" option is disabled, the "Data Quality
Assessment" column displays "No Assessment Done). In addition, the "Source Measurement Quality List" column contains
XML that contains a list of measurements aggregated by condition/quality.

###### Validations

As settlement transactions are created and move through their various states, several validations are performed to ensure
proper processing. These include:

- Validating the business object used to create the settlement transaction

- Validating the start and end dates for the settlement transaction

- Validating the settlement transaction’s service quantities

- Validating the existing settlement transactions for the same calculation period

- Validating whether or not the settlement transaction can be deleted

###### Settlement Transaction Communication

Upon completion of calculations (or approval of calculations if the approval is required), settlement transaction results can
be exported and sent to market participants This is done via an outbound communication created by the Create Settlement
Transaction Outbound Communication algorithm. This communication is responsible for deriving and gathering the
appropriate data to send to the market participant and creating and sending an outbound message.

There are two many ways in which settlement transactions are sent:

- **Contract: Sending by contract involves sending the results of a settlement transaction to a recipient (such as an ISO)**
using an identifier from the market contract.

- **Identifier: Sending by identifier involves sending the results of a settlement transaction to a recipient using an identifier**
from the market participant.

###### Communication Types

The type of outbound communication created is based on the Outbound Communication Type defined on the settlement
transaction’s settlement subscription type. Communication types define the following about settlement transaction outbound
communications:

- **Communication Flow: The direction of communications based on this type (outbound or inbound).**

- **Suppress Zeros: Designates whether or not data should be sent for a service quantity of 0.**

- **Message Generation Method: Specifics if messages be sent as a single message to the market or broken down to one**
message per Identifier/Contract.

- **External Communication Type: Defines whether the communication type is “Settlement by Contract” or “Settlement**
by Identifier”.

- **Export Data Identification: Defines combinations of UOM/TOU/SQI that represent the final outcome of the settlement**
transaction to be passed to the market

- **Reconciliation: Defines the appropriate identifier or contract to include in the data sent to the market participant:**

  - **Contract Reconciliation: defines the appropriate identifier for the market contract associated with the service**
quantity. Used when sending data by contract.

  - **Identifier Reconciliation: Defines the characteristic type for the market participant used to retrieve the appropriate**
identifier. Used when sending data by identifier.

- **Exception Handling: Defines how exceptions are handled, including To Do Type and Role, Retry Frequency, and the**
maximum number of times the system will retry to process the communication


-----

###### Retrieving Service Quantities

Once created, the outbound communication retrieves a list of service quantities for the settlement transaction and inserts
the details into the Settlement Transaction Details list. The specifics of how this is done is based on whether the settlement
transaction is sent by contract or by identifier.

**Send Settlement Transaction By Contract**
Sending data by contract uses outbound communications based on the Send Settlement Transaction by Contract business
object. The Retrieve Settlement Transaction SQs Contract algorithm retrieves the list of service quantities that match the
UOM/TOU/SQI combination defined on the communication type, and for each service quantity found that has a market
contract it will retrieve the identifier for that contract and populate the appropriate details into the Settlement Transaction
Details list. The algorithm processes the entire service quantity result set even if it cannot find an identifier for a given
contract. This way a user can see all identifier resolution errors at once (instead of needing to fix them one by one to see the
next error).

**Send Settlement Transaction By Identifier**
Sending data by identifier uses outbound communications based on the Send Settlement Transaction by Identifier business
object. The Retrieve Settlement Transaction SQs for Identifier algorithm extracts the market participant from the attributes
associated to the service quantity’s measuring component. The measuring components that will be associated to the service
quantity in this instance will be aggregation measuring components that hold a list of dimensions that incudes a market
participant. The algorithm then retrieves the list of service quantities that match the UOM/TOU/SQI combination defined
on the communication type and for each service quantity found that has a measuring component, it retrieves the measuring
component’s market participant and then retrieve the identifier for that market participant and populate the appropriate
details into the Settlement Transaction Details list. The algorithm processes the entire service quantity result set even if
it cannot find a market participant or an identifier for a given market participant. This way a user can see all identifier
resolution errors at once (instead of needing to fix them one by one to see the next error).

###### Sending Settlement Transactions to Market Participants

After the outbound communication has retrieved the appropriate service quantities, the outbound message creates an
outbound message to the market participant (defined as the Recipient on the settlement transaction’s settlement subscription
or settlement subscription type).

The Send Settlement Transaction Details algorithm creates one more outbound messages based on the outbound message
type defined for the market participant’s Settlement Transaction Notification processing method (see below for more
details).

- If the Message Generation Method on the communication type is set to “One Comprehensive Message” the outbound
communication creates a single outbound message that contains all the service quantities retrieved.

- If the Message Generation Method on the communication type is set to “Multiple Messages Based on Data” the
outbound communication creates a separate outbound message for each of the service quantities retrieved.

###### Configuring Market Participants for Settlement Transaction Communication

To support sending settlement transactions to market participants, the following processing method must be defined for the
market participants to which settlement transactions are sent:

**Processing Role** **Processing Method**

Settlement Transaction Notification How to Send Settlement Subscription Related Information

Used to send a settlement transaction outbound message to a market

participant.


-----

**Processing Role** **Processing Method**

**Default Outbound Message Type: The default outbound message**

type to create for outbound message sent to market participants. The

base package does not include an outbound message business object

for this. This must be created based on the requirements of each

implementation and market participant.

If appropriate, override outbound message types can be defined for

specific settlement subscription types.

In addition, the following objects must be configured to send data requests:

- External System

- Outbound Message Type

- Message Sender

chunks of load that can be purchased. In this example, the load could be broken up in the following manner: Contract
#1234 buys 12 tranches, Contract #1235 buys 1 tranche, and Contract #1236 buys 51 tranches (each of these three
would be a market award) A factor can be used to define different tranche quantities over time for the same market
award.

  - **Percentage Awards: Percentage Awards allocate a percentage of the remaining load. A factor can be used to define a**
different percentage over time for the same market award.

  - **Fixed Profile Awards: Fixed Profile Awards leverage a profile measuring component to designate an amount that**
must be allocated from the overall load to this market award. A factor can be used to define different profiles over
time for the same market award.

- **Start Date / End Date: The date range for the market award**

- **Award Details: Details of the award, including the source (Static Value or Factor) and quantity (either a fixed value or**
factor value)

- **Characteristics: Characteristics for the award, if appropriate**

###### Market Products

 About Market Products

Market products are used to allocate market awards to market participants. Market products are referenced by the Market
Award Allocation settlement calculation rule via a parent Market Product Set. Market products of class “Parent Allocation”
can have child products. This allows definition of hierarchies of market products and related awards,

Market products are defined by the following:

- **Market Product Set: The Market Product Set to which the Market Product is associated.**

- **Market Product Type: The Market Product Type for the market product. This defines the business object used to create**
the market product and its market awards. For formula-based products, the market product type also defines the formula
used to calculate award allocation.

- **Product Code: A unique code for the product, often provided by an external system**

- **Product Class: The type of product. The base package supports two product classes: Parent Allocation or Contract**
Fulfillment:

  - **Parent Allocation: Indicates that the market product is a parent level product that divides out a certain allocation of**
the total amount to be then divided further amongst child products.

  - **Contract Fulfillment: Indicates that the market product ties to an "end result" award that can then be tied to a Market**
Contract

- **Execution Sequence: Defines the sequence in which the market product will be executed within its parent Market**
Product Set

- **Awards: One or more Market Awards associated with the market product. These define how load and procurement are**
allocated when the market product is processed by the Market Award Allocation settlement calculation rule.

###### Maintaining Market Products

#### Data Access Restrictions

##### Using Data Access Restrictions

The focus for multi-jurisdiction support in Oracle Utilities Meter Data Management is on restricting access to the user
interface. This occurs through defining different Access Groups by operating company which then marks the Service Point
with the access capabilities. The Service Point has a field named Access Group which allows you to define specific access
to the Service Point.

If Access Group is set on the Service Point, then the user interface search screens within Oracle Utilities Meter Data
Management will only allow users that are assigned to the proper Access Role to be able to access that Service Point.

For additional information see Defining Access Groups.

###### Defaulting Access Groups on Service Points

If there is a desire to set a default Access Group by jurisdiction, then this can be accomplished on configuration for Markets.
When defining a Market there is an option to add a Default Access Group. This value will be used to mark any newly
created Service Point with the same Access Group value defined on the related Market.

###### Example Scenarios

Below are some examples of how Data Access Restrictions can be implemented:

**Example 1:Split Access by Market - an example utility "ABC Energy" that has 3 operating companies.**

**Example 2: Isolating Important Customers - an example utility "XYZ Energy" that has 2 operating companies but would**
also like to isolate access to Large commercial customers for one of the companies.

#### To Do Processing

There are numerous events that trigger the creation of email-like messages describing work that requires human attention.
For example, if a bill segment has an error, a message is created to highlight such. We refer to each message as a To Do
**Entry. In this section, we describe how to view, manage and work To Do entries.**

**FASTPATH:** We recommend familiarizing yourself with the topics described in The Big Picture of To Do Lists to fully
appreciate how To Do entries are managed by the system.

##### Understanding To Do Processing

The topics in this section provide background information on To Do processing functionality.

###### To Do Role

Each To Do entry is assigned a specific To Do Role. The role defines the users who may work on the entry. The permissible
roles that may be assigned to a To Do entry are defined on the entry's To Do type. One or more users within a role may
be designated as a supervisor, who is allowed to assign To Do entries to other people. Supervisors are determined through
application security access.

Refer to To Do Entries Reference A Role to learn more about role assignment.

After an entry is created, its role may be changed to any role defined as valid for the entry's To Do type. Manual changes of
a To Do entry's role are recorded on the To Do entry log.

###### To Do Priority

A To Do entry is associated with a priority level representing its processing order compared to other entries. Refer to
The Priority Of A To Do Entry for more information on how an entry's priority is initially assigned and how it may be
automatically updated by the system.


-----

A user may manually override a To Do entry's priority at any time. Once overridden, automatic recalculation of the priority
is no longer performed so as not to override the value explicitly set by the user. Manual overrides of a To Do entry's priority
are recorded on the To Do entry log.

**NOTE:** Only users that are currently assigned to a Being Worked On To Do entry or ones that are valid for the role of
an Open To Do entry may manually change the priority.

###### Work Distribution

This topic goes overs the various possible actions a user can take to adjust what role or what user is associated with a To Do
entry while it is in a non-complete state.

**Adjusting the Role**
A To Do entry must always reference a role. When a To Do entry are created in the Open state and is associated with a role.
The following points highlight ways to adjust the role associated with a To Do entry.

- A user viewing a record on the To Do Entry page may use the Forward or Send Back action to change the role.

- A supervisor using the To Do Search page may assign a user not linked to the current role. In this case, the system will
update the role to one valid for the assignee.

**Assigning a To Do to a User**
There are several ways to assign a To Do entry to a user (causing its status to transition to Being Worked On):

- The To Do Management portal provides many filters and viewing options to review To Do entries for a give To Do
Type. In addition, it displays a rich amount of detail for the resulting To Do entries, helping users to make decisions.
Users may use this page to assign work to themselves and supervisors may use this to assign work to others.

- A supervisor can use the Supervisor Functions pages to review, assign and reassign To Dos to users.

- A user viewing an entry on the To Do Entry page may use the Forward to a User or the Send Back action to assign the
entry to a different.

- A user may use the To Do list pages to review and assign To Dos to themselves.

- All of the above assignment functions may also be performed using the To Do Search page.

The system can also be configured to dynamically assign the highest priority work to users on demand whenever they are
available for fixing errors.

**NOTE:** **Assignment on demand is in a plug-in. You can customize the next assignment plug-in on the installation**
options to follow your organization's work distribution rules. The product provides an algorithm out of the box (F1**NEXT-TDNS) that can assign work solely based on priority. Another algorithm (F1-NEXT-TDSK) may be used to**
only consider To Do entries the user has the proper skills to resolve. Your implementation may provide a different
algorithm based on your own business rules.

One of the main benefits of the assignment on demand approach is that work is allocated real-time based on most current
information such as skills, priority, user availability, etc. This also means that work remains unassigned until a user is
actually going to work on it making it available to any qualified user.

Assignment "on demand" is possible from the Current To Do zone on the Dashboard portal. Refer to this zone to learn
about all the functions it provides.

**Reopening / Unassigning a To Do**
It is possible to transition a To Do entry from Being Worked On back to Open.

- A user viewing a record assigned to them on the To Do Entry page may use the Forward to a role action to move the
entry back to Open.


-----

- The Unassign button on the To Do Management portal or the Reopen button on the To Do Search page causes the To
Do entry to go back to Open.

###### A User's Current To Do

When you are actively working on a specific To Do entry, there are tools to make this To Do the one that is displayed in
the Current To Do dashboard zone. The act of making a To Do entry your current To Do, also navigates you to the related
object (or if the To Do type is configured to launch a script, the script is launched.

If your organization's practice is to assign work to users up front, then a typical approach is that you would start by
reviewing a list of entries assigned to you using one of the base pages and drill down on an entry in the list to start working
on it. In some pages, there is a way for you to enable a list of To Do Entries that you can work through without needing to
return to the query page to get the next entry.

The following points highlight the available base pages and their supported functionality.:

- To Do Management allows you to use filters to view a list of entries assigned to you or open. (If you plan to work on a
To Do entry that is open, you should first assign it to yourself. No action automatically assigns it.) Click the Work List
icon in the Action column to populate the Work List zone in the dashboard with the results of the search. Click the Work
button to choose the To Do entry you wish to start with. This drills you into the related object and populates the Current
To Do zone with this To Do. Use the entries in the Work List zone to subsequently work on other To Do entries.

- To Do List allows you to start working on a To Do by clicking the entry's message description link. If the To Do entry
is Open, this action will assign it to you automatically. Any other To Do entries that were in that results list on that page
become an internal work list and the Previous button and Next button are enabled in the Current To Do zone to work
through that list.

- To Do Search allows you to start working on a To Do by clicking the entry's message description link. (If you plan to
work on a To Do entry that is open, you should first assign it to yourself. No action automatically assigns it.) Any other
To Do entries that were in that results list on that page become an internal work list and the Previous button and Next
button are enabled in the Current To Do zone to work through that list.

Before working on a new To Do, if the problem is resolved, use the actions in the Current To Do zone to mark the entry
Complete.

Additionally, users may have the option to click on the Assign me a To Do button on the Current To Do dashboard zone
to request their next task. The returned To Do entry automatically becomes the user's Current To Do. This does not enable
any work list functionality.

###### To Do Characteristics

Characteristics are used to associated related information to a To Do entry. Refer to Linking Additional Information to a To
Do Entry for more information.

Several pages in the system allow you to view a To Do entry's characteristic values and / or search for To Do entries by
their characteristics.

- The To Do Management portal includes up to five filters to search for To Do entries by a characteristic value. In
addition, the search results display all the current characteristics as name / value pairs.

- The To Do Entry includes a zone to display any existing characteristics. In addition, if a user is allowed to modify a To
Do Entry, the edit dialogue allows a user to add or change characteristics. Note that for manual To Do types, the valid
characteristic types are driven by the To Do type. For automated To Do types, if valid To Do characteristic types are
configured on the To Do type, only those are available. Otherwise, any valid To Do characteristic type may be linked.

- The To Do Search allows includes a single characteristic type / value filter.


-----

###### Related To Do Entries

A user working on a To Do may want to know of other To Dos that may be related to the same problem. If they can be
worked by the same user they may get resolved faster. It seems almost impossible to programmatically determine whether
two To Dos really stem from the same problem. The user should therefore be presented with a list of potentially related To
Dos from which they can select the truly relevant ones.

A To Do entry is considered potentially related to a given To Do if they reference a common entity via a characteristic. For
example, if a given To Do references a certain account then any To Do referencing that same account is considered related
to it.

**NOTE:** The common entity is any characteristic value linked to the To Do entry where the characteristic type is a
**Foreign Key and the main table of the foreign key is classified as a Master or Transaction table.**

There are various places where the user is informed as to whether or not the current To Do Entry is related to other To Do
Entries.

- To Do entry maintenance displays in insight indicating the number of related To Do Entries for the current To Do. In
addition, a Related To Do Entries zone shows information about each related To Do.

- The Current To Do dashboard zone includes related To Do information and actions.

- The To Do Management query includes a count of related To Do entries.

- The To Do Search page supports a Related To Do filter that lists all related To Do entries for a given entry.

###### Complete A To Do

After you finish working on an entry, you can mark it as Complete. At this point, you may want to review potentially
related To Do entries and complete those that have been addressed by resolving the problem associated with the current
entry.

When you complete a To Do, a log entry is created that indicates when the To Do was completed and by whom.

There are multiple ways in which you can complete a To Do.

- The To Do Management page provides many filters in addition to To Do Type. One or more entries may be completed in
this page.

- Use the To Do Entry page to complete a single To Do Entry. The user may also choose to add comments when
completing a To Do on this page.

- The To Do List page allows you to complete one or more selected entries of a specific To Do Type.

- The To Do Search page allows you to search for To Do entries using various search criteria and complete selected ones.

- You may also use the Current To Do zone to complete the current entry you are working on and/or all related entries
assigned to you.

**NOTE:** It is possible for the system to automatically mark an entry as Complete. Refer to The Lifecycle Of A To Do
Entry for more information.

###### Log Entry Events

Any user may add a User Details log entry to any To Do at any time (even after it's completed). Refer to To Do Entry page
for more information.

The To Do Management portal also allows users to add a User Details log entry to one or more selected entries.

##### Managing To Do Entries

This section describes the various pages available to view and work on To Do entries.


-----

###### To Do Management

The To Do Management portal provides a multi-query zone that includes a search for To Do entries using To Do Type
and other To Do information. Users may search for entries using multiple criteria and perform common actions, such as
assignment and completion, on selected entries.

It is intended to be used by both supervisors and non-supervisor To Do users. Supervisors are identified by their security
access to the portal.

Use Menu > To Do > To Do Management to navigate to the portal.

###### To Do Information Search

This zone allows you to search for non-closed To Do entries using various attributes of the entries, and to perform actions
on selected ones.

**NOTE:** **Results are restricted by role. For supervisors, this search returns To Do entries that meet the search criteria**
and are in a role of which the supervisor is a member. For non supervisors, the search returns open To Do entries that
meet the search criteria and are in a role of which the user is a member or entries currently assigned to the user. Refer to
To Do Entries Reference A Role for more information about roles.

The following sections describe the features of this zone.

**Search Filters**
The following table describes each of the different filters supported by this zone.

**Search Filter** **Description**

To Do Type Use this filter to restrict the search to To Do entries of a specific type.

Only To Do Types where the user is a member of at least one valid role

for the type will be available for selection.

To Do Entry Status Use this filter to restrict the search to To Do entries with a status of

**Open or Being Worked On. Note that the underlying query excludes**

completed To Do entries.

Days Old On the To Do Management portal, this option is represented by a pair

of filter fields. Use these filters to restrict the search to To Do entries

whose age falls within a given range in days. For example, entering

values of 2 - 5 will restrict the search to entries that are greater than or

equal to two days old and less than or equal to five days old.

On the To Do Dashboard portal, this option lists the To Do Summary

age ranges as set up for the user. Select a specific age range to restrict

the search to To Do entries whose age falls within the given range in

days.

Assign To User Use this filter to restrict the search to To Do entries assigned to a

particular user. This filter only appears if the current user has To Do

supervisor access.

Priority Use this filter to restrict the search to To Do entries with a specific

priority.

Key Value Use this filter to restrict the search to To Do entries with a sort key

value containing the entered value.

Message Use this filter to restrict the search to To Do entries with a specific

message. This filter appears after the To Do Type filter has been


-----

**Search Filter** **Description**

populated and shows a list of the message texts from all non closed To

Do entries of the selected To Do Type.

Characteristic Use these filters to restrict the search to To Do entries with a specific

**Characteristic Type and value. Up to five characteristic type and value**

pairs may be entered. For manual To Do types, the list of characteristic

types will be restricted to the characteristic types defined for the To Do

Type. For automated To Do Types, if valid To Do characteristic types

are configured for the To Do type, only those are shown; otherwise, all

valid characteristic types for the To Do Entry entity are shown.

The system shows the total number of To Do entries displayed and the total number that satisfy your search criteria
immediately below the set of results.

**NOTE:** For performance reasons, the search zone is configured to restrict the number of rows retrieved by the query.
The 'Total Records' number will indicate whether there are more To Do entries that meet the criteria than can be
displayed.

**Search Results**
The zone will display all To Do entries that meet the search criteria, up to the limit defined as a parameter to the zone. The
following columns are displayed initially:

- The Action column includes the button Work. Click this button to drill into the page on which the entry’s respective
object is displayed. If the To Do type has been configured to associate a script with this To Do entry's message number,
then instead of being taken to the respective page, the associated script is launched. Refer to Working On A To Do Entry
for more information.

**NOTE:** **Current To Do. Drilling into an entry from this page sets it to be the user's current To Do. Refer to A User's**
Current To Do for more information.

**CAUTION:** **Automatic Assignment! When you click the Work button for an open entry, the system changes the**
status of the entry to Being Worked On and assigns it to you.

**NOTE:** **Work List. This column has a Work List icon. Clicking this icon populates the Work List dashboard zone**
with the results. Clicking on entries in the Work List zone performs all the logic described here when clicking the
Work button for one entry. It will drill into the related object or launch a script, if configured. It will make this To Do
the 'current' To Do and will assign it to you if it is Open.

- Entries are sorted by their Priority. Highest in priority are listed first.

- **Days Old is the number of days since the To Do entry was created by the system. Entries are sorted from youngest to**
oldest within priority.

- **Status is the current status of the To Do entry.**

- **Assign To User is the user currently assigned to the To Do entry.**

- **Message is the message associated with the To Do entry.**

- **Related displays a count of entries that are potentially related to the current entry based on having the same foreign key**
characteristic values. Click the hyperlink to navigate to the To Do Search page with the current entry as the Related To
Do Filter value.


-----

**Note displays a Comment icon** if there are either comments or a log entry of type Forwarded, Sent Back or
**User Details on the To Do Entry. Click the icon to open a pop-up window which displays the To Do entry information,**
message, comments and logs.

- **Characteristics displays the characteristic types and values for the entry as a concatenated string.**

- **Related Entity displays the information for the object related to this entry. The information string allows you to navigate**
to the page on which the entry's respective object is displayed.

- **To Do ID is the system generated key of the entry. Click the hyperlink to navigate to the To Do Entry page to view or**
maintain the current entry.

Click the Column Configuration icon in the zone header to show the Column Configuration Area in which
additional columns can be added to the results. The additional columns include the following:

- **Create Date/Time contains the date and time the To Do entry was created by the system.**

- **Key 1 to Key 5 contain the first five sort key values for the entry.**

- **To Do Role displays the description of the role for the To Do entry.**

**Actions**
The zone provides the ability to perform certain actions on one or more selected To Do Entries.

Click the check box in the results list heading to select all entries displayed in the grid or click the box in a row to select a
specific entry. The following actions are available:

- Use the Update button to open a pop-up window in which you can update the priority and/or add a User Detailslog entry
to the selected To Do entries.

- Use the Assign button to assign a user to the selected To Do entries. Supervisors will be presented with a pop-up window
in which they can choose the assignee from a list of users who are members of at least one role for the To Do Type. The
user search includes information about the number of To Do entries already assigned to each user. For users without
supervisor access, the current user is assumed to be the assignee and the window is not displayed. Note that the system
does not allow a non supervisor to assign themselves a To Do that is being worked on by another user.

- Use the Unassign button to reopen the selected To Do entries and remove the assignee. Note that the system does not
allow non supervisors to reopen a To Do that is being worked on by another user.

- Use the Complete button to complete the selected To Do entries. Both supervisors and non supervisors may complete
any To Do entry, including those assigned to other users.

###### To Do Supervisor Functions

This section describes several To Do transactions that aid supervisors in the monitoring and assignment of To Do entries.

###### Supervisor To Do Summary

This Supervisor To Do Summary page summarizes To Do entries by To Do Type. Only entries that are Open (i.e., not
assigned to a specific user) or Being Worked On are summarized.

**NOTE:** Only To Do entries that are assigned to a role to which you belong are summarized on this page. Refer to To
Do Entries Reference A Role for more information.

Use Menu > To Do > Supervisor To Do Summary to open this page.

**Description of Page**


-----

This page summarizes all To Do entries that are Open or Being Worked On.

- **To Do Type contains the description of the To Do type.**

- **Priority provides a total count of To Do entries of a given type by priority. For each distinct priority the description**
includes the priority value followed by the corresponding number of entries. If all entries are of the same priority no
additional count is displayed.

- **Total contains the total of Open and Being Worked On entries. The hyperlink navigates to the Supervisor To Do**
Assignment transaction, setting it to display all Open and Being Worked On entries for the given To Do Type.

- **Open contains the number of To Do Entries whose status is Open. The hyperlink navigates to the Supervisor To Do**
Assignment transaction, setting it to display all Open entries for the given To Do Type.

- **Being Worked On contains the number of To Do entries whose status is Being Worked On. The hyperlink navigates**
to the Supervisor To Do Assignment transaction, setting it to display all Being Worked On entries for the given To Do
Type.

The "age bars" that appear to the right of the totals highlight the age of the To Do entries. The colors red, yellow and green
are used to highlight the relative number of old, middle-aged and new To Do entries. The age associated with each of these
colors is user-configurable.

###### Supervisor User Summary

The Supervisor User Summary page summarizes To Do entries by the user who is assigned to work on the entries. Only
entries that are Being Worked On are summarized.

**NOTE:** Only To Do entries that are assigned to a role to which you belong are summarized on this page. Refer to To Do
Entries Reference A Role for more information.

Use Menu > To Do > Supervisor User Summary to open this page.

**Description of Page**

This page contains a grid that displays all assigned To Do entries by User ID and To Do type. It indicates how many To
Do entries of the displayed Type are assigned to the user (Assigned this Type) and how many To Do entries in total are
assigned to the user (Assigned Total).

Clicking the hyperlinks transfer you to the Supervisor To Do Assignment transaction. On this transaction, you can assign /
reassign To Do entries to a specific user. The difference is that clicking the To Do Type hyperlink causes only Open entries
to be displayed on the Assignment transaction. Clicking the count in the Assigned this Type column causes Being Worked
**On entries assigned to the displayed user to be shown.**

###### Supervisor To Do Assignment

This page lists To Do entries of a given type and allows a supervisor to assign / reassign them to a designated user.

**NOTE:** Refer to the To Do Management portal for a page that provides many more filters to narrow down the results. In
addition, it provides more data in the results and allows the user to adjust the priority of To Do entries.

Use Menu > To Do > Supervisor To Do Assignment to open this page.

**Description of Page**

This page contains Open or Being Worked On To Do entries of a given type. These entries can be assigned to a specified
user one-by-one or several at a time. The following points describe this functionality:

- You can select a different To Do Type by typing in a value or pressing the search button in the upper right corner. An
**Info description of the To Do type appears on the left.**


-----

- You can change the list of entries displayed according to their status. Select the Filter by status to be All (blank), Open,
or Being Worked On.

- For Being Worked On entries, you may also Filter by User to limit the search to a specific user assigned to the To Do
entries.

- If you want to re-sort the entries by a different value, click the search button adjacent to Extra Information. Each row's
respective sort value is displayed in the Extra Information column.

**NOTE:** **Extra Information. Each To Do list's default Extra Information is defined on the list's To Do Type. Also note**
that each To Do list's available Extra Information differs.

- Click the Select All button to select all entries displayed in the grid. Click the Clear All to remove the selections in the
grid.

- Use the checkbox if you want to assign specific entries.

###### To Do Entry

Refer to Understanding To Do Processing for detailed explanations about many To Do entry features.

To view a To Do entry. Use Menu > To Do > To Do Entry > Search . You are brought to a query portal with options for
searching for a To Do Entry. Note that some query options limit the results. Refer to the inline help for more information.

**NOTE:** **Restricted by role. Any user may change Comments for any To Do Entry. In addition, any user may add user**
Log details. However, for all other changes and actions, you may only change To Do entries that are assigned to you
or ones that are Open and assigned to a role to which you belong. Refer to To Do Entries Reference A Role for more
information about roles.

Once a To Do Entry has been selected, you are brought to the maintenance portal to view and maintain the selected record.

The inline help provides information about several fields. The following points highlight information about some of the
fields that may be visible.

If the To Do entry has non-complete related entries an insight appears indicating the number of related entries. In addition,
details about the related entries are shown in the Related To Do Entries zone.

If the To Do entry was Created By a background process, information about that background process appears with a link
allowing the user to drill into the batch run, if desired. Refer to To Dos Created for Object-Specific Error Conditions for
more information.

If the To Do type is configured to To Do Entries May Be Routed Out Of The System, the Extract Info appears. If the
extract process is pending, the information indicates that. Otherwise, if it has run, information about the background process
appears with a link allowing the user to drill into the batch run, if desired.

The Characteristics collection shows existing characteristics. This collection is maintained using the Edit action for users
that are allowed to update this To Do entry. Refer to To Do Entry Characteristics for more information.

**Actions**
This page has two special actions.

- Use the Forward to assign a To Do to another user or role. When a To Do is forwarded, a log entry indicates who
forwarded the To Do, to whom it was forwarded, and the specified reason. The dialogue prompts for whether to send to a
User or a Role. The search for User includes information about the number of To Do entries already assigned to this user.
When choosing a User, confirm the correct Role. The Details provided are captured in the log entry.

- **Send Back is only applicable if the Sent By user is populated. When a To Do is sent back, a log entry is created that**
indicates when the To Do was sent back and by whom. If the To Do is Open, this dialogue allows you to send it back


-----

to a different role. If the To Do is assigned to you, the dialogue allows you to re-assign the To Do to the person who
assigned it to you. The Details provided are captured in the log entry.

**Related To Do Entries**
If the To Do has related To Do entries, this zone appears with information about the related entries. Use this Edit hyperlink
to navigate to the To Do Search query to perform actions on the related entries.

###### Adding a Manual To Do Entry

If your system is configured with manual To Do types, you can add a To Do entry online.

Open the Menu > To Do > To Do Entry > Add.

You are prompted for a To Do Type. Only To Do types that are set up for manual usage appear in the list.

The default To Do Type Priority is displayed adjacent. Use Override Priority to override the default priority assigned by
the system.

Type a Subject for your To Do entry. Depending on how the To Do type is set up, the subject may appear as the message in
the To Do entry and To Do lists.

Enter a Comment to provide a longer description of and more details about the To Do entry.

**Send To indicates whether the new To Do will be assigned to a Role (the default) or User.**

The Role indicates the role to which this To Do entry will be assigned. Only users of the specified role will be able to view
and work on the To Do entry. The role is defaulted from the To Do type. If you want to assign the To Do to a different role,
change the specified role. You can only assign the To Do entry to one of the roles specified on the To Do type.

**User appears if Send To is set to User. Use this option if you want to assign the To Do to a specific user. The user must be**
a member of the selected role.

If the To Do type defines valid characteristic types, the Characteristics collection is visible. If any of the characteristic
types are flagged as Default on the To Do type, the characteristic type with its default value (if applicable) are displayed.

###### To Do Search

This page allows you to search for To Do entries using various search criteria, and perform various actions on selected ones.
This page includes completed To Do entries in its search results, when applicable with respect to the filter criteria.

Use Menu > To Do > To Do Search to open this page.

**NOTE:** Refer to the To Do Management portal for a page that provides many more filters to narrow down the results. In
addition, it provides more data in the results and allows the user to adjust the priority of To Do entries.

**NOTE:** **No restriction by role. This page returns all To Do entries that meet the search criteria, regardless of the To Do**
entry's role. Using the search, a user may drill into the details of a To Do entry even if the To Do is not assigned to the
user. Refer to To Do Entries Reference A Role for more information about roles.

The top half of the page is where you enter the criteria used to search for To Do entries.

**CAUTION:** Try to be as specific as possible when entering search criteria. Why? Because entering open-ended search
criteria may have a severe impact on response times.

The following table describes each of the different search filters.


-----

**Search Filter** **Description**

Related To Do If you're searching for potentially related entries for a given To Do
entry, choose Specific To Do for the Related To Do Filter. Enter the
**To Do ID.**

A filter value of Not Applicable defaults.

To Do Type If you're searching for a To Do entry and you know the value of a To
Do Type linked to the To Do entry, choose Specific To Do Type for
the To Do Type Filter. Enter the To Do Type.

A filter value of All defaults.

Char Type If you're searching for a To Do entry and you know the value of
a characteristic linked to the To Do entry, choose Specific Char
**Type for the Char Type Filter. Enter the Characteristic Type and**
**Characteristic Value.**

A filter value of Not Applicable defaults.

Only characteristic types that include a characteristic entity of To Do
**Entry and that have been marked to allow searching by characteristic**
value are available.

User Use this search method if you know the Created By User, Assigned
**To User or Completed By User for the To Do entry. Enter the**
appropriate User Id.

A filter value of Not Applicable defaults.

Date Range Use this field if you're searching for a To Do entry and know the Date
**Created or Date Completed.**

A filter value of Date Created defaults. The Start Date/Time defaults
to the current date, 12:00AM and the End Date/Time defaults to the
current date, 11:59PM.

If you enter a Date Range Filter of All, the system ignores this search
method.

Status Use this search method to restrict the search to To Do entries with a
specific status value. You may search for To Do entries in the status
of Open, Being Worked On or Completed. You may also perform a
combination search for To Do entries that have a status value of either
**Open or Being Worked On.**

A filter value of All defaults.

**NOTE:** **The system allows any combination of values. The system does not try to validate your search combinations,**
even if they do not make sense. For example, if you enter a User Filter value of Completed By User and a Status
**Filter value of Open, you will not get an error. In this case, the system will find no records that match your criteria**
(because To Do entries that are Open do not have a Completed By User).

The system shows the total number of To Do entries that satisfy your search results immediately below the grid.

The first group of To Do entries is displayed in the grid at the bottom of the page.

- Click the Select All button to select all entries displayed in the grid. Click the Clear All to remove the selections in the
grid.

-----

- **Last Assigned Date/Time contains the date and time the To Do entry was most recently assigned to a user, if applicable,**
along with the Assigned To user.

- **Message contains a description of the To Do entry. If the To Do entry is in the status of Open or Being Worked On,**
the message description allows you to drill into the page on which the entry's respective object is displayed. If the To Do
type has been configured to associate a script with this To Do entry's message number, then instead of being taken to the
respective page, the associated script is launched. Refer to Working On A To Do Entry for more information.

**NOTE:** **Current To Do. Drilling into the page by clicking the Message hyperlink does not automatically assign**
**Open To Do entries to the user (as the To Do List page does when clicking on the Message). But it does treat this as**
the user's current to do, enabling the functionality in the Current To Do dashboard zone. Refer to A User's Current To
Do for more information.

- **Status contains the current status of the To Do entry.**

- **Completion Date/Time contains the date and time the To Do entry was completed and the user who completed the**
entry, if applicable.

- **To Do Type contains a description of the To Do type for the To Do entry.**

**Actions**

- Use the Assign button to assign or reassign the selected entries to a user. Enter a user ID or search for a user using the
**Assign To User field. By default this field is populated with the current user's ID. Note that the user's current number of**
assignments is displayed adjacent. Upon successful processing, the selected entries are assigned to the specified user and
the status of Open entries becomes Being Worked On. Additionally, a corresponding log entry is added to each To Do.

**NOTE:** You may only assign To Do entries to yourself or to someone else if you are a valid user in the To Do entry's
current role.

**NOTE:** Only users with Supervisor Assignment access rights may reassign entries that are not currently assigned to
them.

- Use the Reopen button to unassign the selected entries from their users. Upon successful processing, the selected entries
become Open and a corresponding log entry is added to each To Do.

**NOTE:** Only users with Supervisor Assignment access rights may unassign entries that are not currently assigned to
them and the user must be a valid user in the To Do entry's current role.

- Use the Complete button to complete the selected entries.

###### To Do Dashboard

This portal provides a high level summary of open and being worked on To Do entries by various criteria. It is intended to
be used by both supervisors and non-supervisor To Do users. An implementation may introduce additional zones to this
portal as needed.

**NOTE:** **Results are restricted by role. For supervisors, the charts consider To Do entries that are in a role of which the**
supervisor is a member. For non supervisors, the charts consider open To Do entries that are in a role of which the user
is a member or entries currently assigned to the user. Refer to To Do Entries Reference A Role for more information
about roles.

Use Menu > To Do > To Do Dashboard to navigate to the portal.


-----

The following zones may appear as part of the portal's Main tab page

- **To Do Entries By Role. This zone summarizes To Do entries by their currently assigned role.**

- **To Do Entries By Status. This zone summarizes To Do entries by their current status.**

- **To Do Entries By Priority. This zone summarizes To Do entries by their priority.**

- **To Do Entries By Age. This zone summarizes To Do entries by age based on age ranges defined for the current user.**

- **To Do Entries By Type. This zone summarizes To Do entries by their to do type.**

Selecting a specific slice of data on any of these zones broadcasts its value to the other zones on the portal allowing them to
filter their data accordingly. Use the Reset action on each zone to reset the filter set by this zone.

The following zone appears as part of the portal's Details tab page

- **To Do Details This zone lists To Do entries that match various criteria and allows the user to work and manage the list.**

###### To Do Details

This zone allows you to search for non-closed To Do entries using various attributes of the entries, and to perform actions
on selected ones.

**NOTE:** **Results are restricted by role. For supervisors, this search returns To Do entries that meet the search criteria**
and are in a role of which the supervisor is a member. For non supervisors, the search returns open To Do entries that
meet the search criteria and are in a role of which the user is a member or entries currently assigned to the user. Refer to
To Do Entries Reference A Role for more information about roles.

The following sections describe the features of this zone.

**Search Filters**
The following table describes each of the different filters supported by this zone.

**Search Filter** **Description**

To Do Type Use this filter to restrict the search to To Do entries of a specific type.

Only To Do Types where the user is a member of at least one valid role

for the type will be available for selection.

To Do Entry Status Use this filter to restrict the search to To Do entries with a status of

**Open or Being Worked On. Note that the underlying query excludes**

completed To Do entries.

Days Old On the To Do Management portal, this option is represented by a pair

of filter fields. Use these filters to restrict the search to To Do entries

whose age falls within a given range in days. For example, entering

values of 2 - 5 will restrict the search to entries that are greater than or

equal to two days old and less than or equal to five days old.

On the To Do Dashboard portal, this option lists the To Do Summary

age ranges as set up for the user. Select a specific age range to restrict

the search to To Do entries whose age falls within the given range in

days.

Assign To User Use this filter to restrict the search to To Do entries assigned to a

particular user. This filter only appears if the current user has To Do

supervisor access.

Priority Use this filter to restrict the search to To Do entries with a specific

priority.


-----

**Search Filter** **Description**

Key Value Use this filter to restrict the search to To Do entries with a sort key

value containing the entered value.

Message Use this filter to restrict the search to To Do entries with a specific

message. This filter appears after the To Do Type filter has been

populated and shows a list of the message texts from all non closed To

Do entries of the selected To Do Type.

Characteristic Use these filters to restrict the search to To Do entries with a specific

**Characteristic Type and value. Up to five characteristic type and value**

pairs may be entered. For manual To Do types, the list of characteristic

types will be restricted to the characteristic types defined for the To Do

Type. For automated To Do Types, if valid To Do characteristic types

are configured for the To Do type, only those are shown; otherwise, all

valid characteristic types for the To Do Entry entity are shown.

The system shows the total number of To Do entries displayed and the total number that satisfy your search criteria
